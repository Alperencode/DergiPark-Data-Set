Makale Başlığı: A Typical Example of Symbolism in Sufism: Ken'an Rifâî's Depiction of the "Rifâî Mihrab"
Özet: It is known that Sufis often use symbols to approximate the abstract meanings in the metaphysical realm to the mental level and to the physical realm. They use metaphors to open up this invisible realm, and sometimes to conceal it. The depiction of the "Rifâî Miḥrāb", which is the subject of this article and was prepared by Sheikh Ken'an Rifai for placement on the cover of his book "Seyyid Ahmed er-Rifâi", contains elements of the ṭarīqa called the dervish dowry as well as symbols relating to the stages of the spiritual path and to the perfect man (al-insān al-kāmil). Thus, it is a typical example of the use of symbols in Sufism. The text prepared by Ken'an Rifai's caliph Ziyâ Cemâl Bey is the first source of reference for the interpretation of the depiction.

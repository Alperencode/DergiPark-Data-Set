Makale Başlığı: Those Who Can't Hold On: Labor Migration to Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire (Late 19th-Early 20th Century)
Özet: The phenomenon of migration is one of the essential activities carried out by man and has been carried out for various reasons since early periods. Although many factors trigger migration, meeting basic needs such as security, food supply, and housing are the leading causes. In this study, the migration to find work, which is one of the crucial reasons for migration, was based. The migrations to Istanbul, the capital, in the last period of the Ottoman Empire were tried to be determined. The status of those who failed and could not find work was examined within the framework of the findings obtained. Again, what those who worked in Istanbul but were unemployed for various reasons did and what demands they made from the centre were also evaluated within the study's subject. The questions the study seeks to answer are; What jobs did these people come from, and where did they come from? How long did they look for work? Where are they? What problems did they face? What demands did they have from the government? The primary source of the study is documents obtained from the Ottoman Archives of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey.

Makale Başlığı: The Presentation of Mobile Exhibition Black Sea Ferry (1926) in Newspapers of The Period and Examination of The Promotional Tour in Terms of Public Relations
Özet: The study deals with the Mobile Exhibition, which was held with the Black Sea Ferry in 1926 with the aim of "to introduce the changes made in the international community and to establish economic relations" right after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. In addition, it aims to evaluate the mobile exhibition in terms of the history of public relations and the application areas of public relations, and to observe how the exhibition was reflected to the Turkish public through newspapers in the initial phase. The study proceeds from a "holistic understanding" at the point of presenting the place of the internationally organized exhibition in the history of public relations and its connections with the fields of practice of public relations, and from the "framing model" at the point of presenting its reflection to the public when it first started to travel. As a result, the Mobile Exhibition initiative is evaluated as a planned "public relations practice example" made without using the term "public relations" in the history of public relations. In addition, it is understood that the exhibition has features that meet the functions of "press relations, destination promotion, public diplomacy, image management and event management" application areas.

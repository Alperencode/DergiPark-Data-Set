In the study, it has been observed that international private schools in Turkey are generally far from being “international”, a systematic and holistic education policy has not been established for these schools, due to the inadequacy of the legislation and the differences in the education and training processes of schools, there are difficulties in the inspection processes, the registration of foreign students under temporary/international protection to these schools adversely affects the social integration process, the principle of reciprocity is not respected in the opening process of the schools.  Various suggestions were made in line with the identified issues.

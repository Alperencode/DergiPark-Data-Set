Makale Başlığı: Investigation of MOF-303 – Active Carbon Mixtures for Passive Thermal Management Applications
Özet: Small sized electronics and IoT devices can be thermally managed through sorbent heat sinks if economical and efficient solutions are developed. Here, we investigate a mixture of metal-organic frameworks and active carbon to lower the costs and increase the water uptake capacity. The mismatch on particle size and physical properties between the two sorbents lead to favorable desorption characteristics while also cutting down on costs. We spray coat the mixture onto copper substrates to obtain passive sorbent heat sinks. Our results display an ≈30% enhancement in the water uptake capacity and an ≈10% improvement in the thermal performance for the heat sinks coated with the mixture when compared to the only MOF case. The enhancement is attributed to fast desorption in the early phases of operation and to slow desorption in the steady state. Furthermore, we also study the coating microscopically through infrared imaging and observe that the carbon is colder than the MOF particles due to the lower thermal conductivity it possesses. This study not only demonstrates an economic way of enhancing the cooling performance of sorbent heat sinks but it also serves as a guideline for the design of desorption driven thermal management strategies.

Makale Başlığı: Histological Examination of Liver Connective Tissue Fibers in Broiler Chickens and Japanese Quails
Özet: Connective tissue fibers are among the elements that make up the connective tissue, which is the most common type of tissue in the organism. The liver, one of the basic organs for life, is the largest gland in the body and connective tissue forms the roof of the organ.Considering that the liver is an organ affected by connective tissue diseases, the connective tissue that forms the roof of the organ gains more importance. The aim of this study is to reveal the presence and distribution of connective tissue fibers in Japanese quail and broiler chicken livers by histological methods. As material, liver tissue samples of 6 adult chickens and 6 quails were used. Gordon Sweet's silver method was applied to show reticular fibers, Verhoeff’ s Van Gieson for elastic fibers and Masson Trichrome staining technique for collagen fibers were applied to tissue samples taken from liver. After the stained preparations were examined under a light microscope, their photographs were taken and the differences between the groups were evaluated histologically. It was observed that collagen fibers stained more strongly in chicken liver Glisson's capsule and around the formations of the portal space. Reticular fibers were seen more densely in the wall of central vein, between hepatocytes and Glisson's capsule in the chicken liver than in the quail liver. Elastic fibers were found to be similar in structure and proportion in both quail and chicken livers.

Makale Başlığı: Suitability Analysis of Apiculture (Beekeeping) Activity Areas with Multi-Criteria Method: A Case Study of Adıyaman
Özet: Turkey ranks 2nd in the world in terms of honey production. Due to many factors that favor Turkey, i.e. rich flora properties, topographically suitable fields, and different climate zones, honey production can be done almost year-long. This study covers Adiyaman province, which is located in the southeast Anatolian region. Adiyaman province, in addition to its topographic diversity, has a rich flora due to the effects of the continental climate and partly Mediterranean climate, acting as a bridge due to the fact that eastern Anatolia, southeastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean region are in the transition zone. The fact that Adiyaman province is rich in flora and topography, as well as being suitable for other features, has allowed many criteria to be used together in the study. The purpose of this study is to identify areas in the province of Adiyaman that are suitable for beekeeping, taking into account natural and human factors. In this context, the layers formed by natural and human environment elements were taken into account in order to obtain maximum efficiency from the bees. In addition, the expectations of the honey producers were analyzed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this context, the results were redesigned as inappropriate, less suitable, appropriate and most appropriate areas with masking process and results maps were made.

Özet: [15:17, 10.11.2021] Feyza Ogr. Yls: In today's world, all organizations that want to create awareness of their brands according to the needs of consumers use traditional media and new media tools very actively. These strategies of brands that give more focus to the male figure in their messages, especially through media tools, have recently reduced their impact and companies have started to show women as stronger characters in the promotion of their brands. As a result of these efforts, stereotypes specific to women in the society were destroyed and messages emphasizing that women have important impact in business life were given.In this study, the commercial film of Turkish Airlines (THY) published for March 8 International Women's Day was evaluated within the scope of femvertising (Female Empowerment Advertising) and analyzed with semiotic method (stage and section contents were analyzed with visual and linguistic indicators). For this purpose, the aim of the study is to synthesize the messages that Turkish Airlines (THY) brand wants to give about the concept of femvertising with the semiotic analysis method, and to ensure that companies serving in different areas prefer the image of women more in the promotion of their brands.

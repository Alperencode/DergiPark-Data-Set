Makale Başlığı: Teacher Perceptions Regarding the 2023 Educational Vision
Özet: DOI: 10.5152/hayef.2019.19013The aim of this study is to define the perceptions of teachers about the 2023 educational vision document, where the teachers’ internalization of the vision document was examined. In this study, which was planned as a descriptive review of quantitative research methods, the ratio cluster sampling technique was used to assign 941 teachers to the sample group of the study. To obtain the research data, we used the “2023 Education Vision Perception Scale” developed by the researchers. The outcome of this study was that the teachers’ perceptions regarding the 2023 educational vision document were low. Women were found to be more perceptive than men and postgraduate students were more perceptive than graduates. In addition, as the professional tenure was increased, the participants’ 2023 educational vision and perceptions were found to decrease. However, although the perceptions of the 2023 educational vision were low in all regions, the philosophical competencies of teachers’ 2023 educational vision were found to be drastically reduced as they moved from the Western regions to the inner and Eastern regions. In the literature, the fact that teachers had not encountered the perceptions of the 2023 educational vision while emphasizing the leading character of this research, points to the possible reversal of the change for which the education system is not presently ready.Cite this article as: Baltacı, A., Coşkun, M.K.

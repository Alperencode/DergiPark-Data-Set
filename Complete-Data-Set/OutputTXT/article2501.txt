Makale Başlığı: EVALUATİON OF THE FİNANCİAL SİTUATİONS OF THE BUSİNESSES TRADED İN THE BIST SPORTS INDEX WİTH THE ALTMAN Z SCORE MODEL
Özet: In order for businesses to reach their goals, they must be financially successful and perform their activities uninterruptedly. Businesses that are not financially successful face the risk of financial failure. Financial failure causes negative possible consequences for businesses and leads to undesirable situations for both companies and countries. Financial failure results in the end of the life of the enterprises or the renewal of the activities and the transition to new orders. This study was carried out in order to determine the financial failures of the companies included in the BIST Sports Index. In the study, the financial statement data of the four companies in the BIST Sports Index for the years 2017-2020 were used. In the study, the financial success of the companies in the BIST Sports Index was analyzed with the Altman Z Score Model. As a result of the study, it was concluded that while the BJKAS enterprise remained in the uncertain area in 2020, other enterprises were described as troubled or unsuccessful in the relevant periods. We recommend to valuable researchers that different financial forecasting models should be applied to the BIST Sports Index in future studies.

Makale Başlığı: آيا صوفيا رمز السلام والتنوع
Özet: On July 10, 2020, the Council of State revoked a 1934 Cabinet decree that had turned Hagia Sophia into a museum, thereby paving the way to restoring its former function. The decision was welcomed by the overwhelming majority of Turkish people, government or opposition supporters alike. Some criticized the decision by creating a false impression that Turkey is turning its back on religious tolerance and diversity. The functional change of Hagia Sophia will have no effect on Turkey’s centuries-old tradition of promoting tolerance, harmony, and diversity. Hagia Sophia will continue to embrace and unite everyone as a symbol of tolerance, peace, and dialogue between cultures and religions

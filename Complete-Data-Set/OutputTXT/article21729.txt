Makale Başlığı: Mucocele and Dermal Collagenous Hyperplasıa in a Calf
Özet: In this presentation it was aimed to report a case of mucocele (sialocele) and dermal collagenous hyperplasia in a 3-day-old, male Montafon calf admitted to the University of Kafkas, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Surgery. Case history revealed a mass under the tongue and a swelling on the ventral part of the neck in the calf. Clinical examination showed a diffuse thickening of the ventral neck skin and a 4x4x3 cm sized, fluid filled sublingual mass which was removed surgically. The sublingual mass and biopsy material from the thickened part of the neck skin was sent for histopathological investigation. Histopathology revealed that the fluid filled sublingual mass was a mucocele (sialocele) and the dermal thickening was diagnosed dermal collagenous hyperplasia. Postoperative follow up for two years showed no recurrence of the sublingual mass. However, the collagenous hyperplasia on the neck region was persistent without any change in size.

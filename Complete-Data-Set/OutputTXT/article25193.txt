Makale Başlığı: IMPROVING ENERGY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF PAKISTAN
Özet: The primary objective of this study was to investigate that either Pakistan needs or not a single regulatory authority for its energy sector by means of integrating Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA), National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) and the regulatory part of Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions (DGPC) in to a single entity “National Energy Market Regulatory Authority” (NEMRA) . To achieve this objective of research, descriptive analysis along with binary logistic regression technique were used. The results showed that due to the current performance of existing energy regulatory framework it is necessary to establish a single autonomous energy regulatory authority (NEMRA) for the energy sector of Pakistan in order to put it out of crises towards grooming and prosperity.

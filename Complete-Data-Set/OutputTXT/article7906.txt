Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF DAILY AND SEASONAL PHOTOVOLTAIC HEAT ISLAND EFFECT ON SEKBANDEMIRLI RURAL REGION BY LOCAL WEATHER DATA RECORDS
Özet: Photovoltaic Power Plants have a considerable share among solar energy conversion technologies toward environmentally sustainable and economically feasible electricity production. However, when a rural region's land surface formed by natural soil types is covered by a Photovoltaic Power Plant (PVPP)'s dark-colored solar modules in large numbers, an artificial albedo (reflectivity) change is expected on that surface. Because of the heat exchange between these modules and the air surrounding them due to albedo alteration, the region's natural weather conditions may experience Photovoltaic Heat Island Effect (PVHIE) as a result of external and time-dependent air temperature oscillations caused by the warming-cooling cycles of solar modules. To observe and analyze a possible PVHIE trend, it has been conducting a field study project since October 2017 for a PVPP near the Sekbandemirli rural region in the Kutahya city of Turkey. The weather data, including air temperature and wind (direction and speed) at every 10-minute and hourly intervals, are collected by the three weather monitoring stations installed at the specific locations inside and outside the PVPP field. The plant's hourly average power output and module temperature data can also be monitored. After conducting statistical, correlational, and graphical analyses, the results show some temporal PVHI formations at the PVPP field center daily and on a seasonal basis. The plant center's air temperature tends to be warmer (up to the 6°C difference) during daytimes and colder (up to the (-3)°C difference) during nighttimes.

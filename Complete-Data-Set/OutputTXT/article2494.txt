Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Eating Habits and Anxiety Levels of Patients and Healthy Adults Who Eat Gluten-Free
Özet: Aim: This study was conducted to evaluate the eating habits and anxiety levels of patients (gluten-sensitive) and healthy adults who eat gluten-free. Material and Method: This descriptive and comparative study was conducted with 114 adults on a gluten-free diet, including 57 healthy, 37 celiac patients, 14 non-celiac gluten sensitive, and six wheat-allergic individuals aged 18-60 years. Data were collected through an online survey. The Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to determine the anxiety levels. Results: Healthy participants consumed vegetables, fruits, rice, corn, quinoa, chia seeds, buckwheat, and gluten-free products more often than gluten-sensitive participants (p<0.05). It was determined that the consumption of breakfast butter, olive oil, coconut oil, molasses, jam, honey, and refined sugar was more common in patients. 63.2% of the healthy participants consume 8-12 glasses of water a day, and 50.9% of the patients consume 4-7 glasses of water a day. The mean trait anxiety score of healthy participants was 41.50 ± 8.17, and 48.78 ± 9.74 for the patients. Conclusion: It was observed that healthy participants preferred healthier foods than patients, but consumed gluten-free ready-made products more often and skipped more meals. Anxiety levels of the patient participants were found to be higher.

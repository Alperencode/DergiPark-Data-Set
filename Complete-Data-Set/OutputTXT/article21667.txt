Makale Başlığı: The Views of Primary Teachers on Learning Losses Occurring During the Covid-19 Pandemic Process
Özet: The aim of the current study is to determine the opinions of primary teachers about possible learning losses that might have occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic and their suggestions for solutions to this problem. The study was designed in the holistic single case design, which is one of the qualitative research methods. The population of the study is comprised of primary teachers working at primary schools in Ankara. Participants of this study were 10 primary teachers working at primary schools located in the city of Ankara in the 2021-2022 school year. The data of the study were collected with a semi-structured interview form developed by the researcher and consisting of three questions. According to the findings obtained as a result of a descriptive content analysis on the collected data, some learning losses might have occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic due to some psychological conditions, fear of losing the loved ones, anxiety about being sick, stress, familial conflicts and problems in having access to distance education experienced by students in this process. In light of the findings of the study, it can be suggested that education given can be made more qualified by developing distance education applications, and that when face-to-face education is initiated again, it is necessary to repeat and revise the subjects studied through distance education, which requires restructuring of the curriculum.

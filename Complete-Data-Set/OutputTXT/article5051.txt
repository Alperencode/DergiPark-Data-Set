Makale Başlığı: Assessment of the highway logistics on carbon footprint
Özet: Developing the quality of the types of greenhouse gasses used within the global environment and reducing carbon emissions are recognized as the main of current logistic changes policies. The paper aims to evaluate the contribution of the impact of highway logistics activity, one of the most important causes of carbon dioxide emissions, on the carbon footprint of the Southern Central Anatolian provinces. In this context, multiple regression analyses were conducted in three locations in the Southern Central Anatolian (Antalya, Kayseri, Konya) involving a total of 12 monthly highway logistics activities and carbon emissions. Before analysis, summarized the status of all logistic activities in the study area and collected data related to carbon emission in these regions. However, the coupling relationship between carbon emissions and logistic conditions in regions was calculated by the regression model. The carbon footprint linked to logistics, for Antalya was 87% (R=0.87), for Kayseri was 94% (R=0.94), and for Konya was 63% (R=0.63). It can be seen that, in the multiple regression analysis, Kayseri has a higher carbon footprint than Antalya and Konya when an estimation of the quantile was carbon footprint. The main academic contribution of this study brings a new perspective to the future assessment of environmental policies and prepares a quantitative principle for the implementation of future carbon footprint policies.

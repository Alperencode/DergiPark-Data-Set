Makale Başlığı: Problems encountered after Care of the İnstitution: A Current Review
Özet: The termination of the care process and the transition to an independent life can be defined as a process that has many different difficulties for young people. Family and social support deficiency, psychosocial problems and underdevelopment of academic/social skills, which are shown among the effects of the care experience, can also negatively affect after care life. This situation highlights the need for policy and social service practices for individuals separated from the care of the institution. In this study, the main problems experienced after institutional care are discussed under the headings of housing, social exclusion, inability to continue higher education, discrimination against women and guidance. In this contex, social policy and social work interventions for the specified problem areas have been analyzed comparatively and some practices have been proposed in this study.

Makale Başlığı: Expenditure Discovery Book and a Project of The Women’s Prison, which was Planned to be Constructed in 1919 in Aydin Sanjak
Özet: In the Ottoman State, until the second half of the 19th century, the execution of the punishments applied to criminals was changed and the prison system was introduced. In order to ensure that detainees and convicts are kept indoors, prisons for women and men were begun to be opened or new buildings were built across the country. Aydın Nisa (Women) Prison, which was planned to be rebuilt in 1919 after giving up the idea of repairing it as it consisted of an old building, was one of them. An expenditure discovery book and a project were prepared for the construction of the prison, which consisted of four wards, a hospital, a kitchen, and staff rooms. As a result of the construction analysis, the construction was calculated to cost 460,752 kuruş but could not be finished after the Greek occupation of Aydın Sanjak and then the collapse of the Ottoman State.

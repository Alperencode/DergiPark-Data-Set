Makale Başlığı: Effects of Different Teaching Methods on Nursing Students’ Motivations and Critical Thinking Disposition: A quasi-experimental Study
Özet: It is important to replace the traditional teacher-centered teaching approach with other different teaching methods. The present study aimed to determine the influence of different teaching methods used in the course of infertility nursing on students’ motivation and on their critical thinking disposition. The study was conducted as a quasi-experimental study using the one-group pretest-posttest design. The optional course of infertility nursing was taken by a total of 113 students. The results demonstrated that the different teaching methods applied in the study led to a statistically significant difference in the students’ their critical thinking dispositions and in their levels of motivation. It was also found that watching movies, technical visits and doing research were more influential on increasing the students’ motivations than other teaching methods. The results revealed the importance of using different active teaching methods for the development of students’ motivations and critical thinking skills in nursing education.

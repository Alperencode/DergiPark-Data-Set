Makale Başlığı: Relationship of VEGF and p53 expression with other prognostic parameters in breast carcinomas
Özet: Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the relationship between VEGF and p53 immunohistochemical expressions and other clinicopathological prognostic parameters in breast carcinomas.Materials and methods: Sections prepared from paraffin-embedded blocks diagnosed with a total of 74 primary breast cancers were examined and VEGF, p53, estrogen, progesterone, Cerb-B2 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical stains were applied. The relationship of VEGF and p53 with other immunohistochemical stains and prognostic parameters was investigated.Results: Statistically significant results were obtained across VEGF with lateralization, grade and lymphovascular invasion. Furthermore, while no staining with VEGF was observed in any of the normal breast tissues, an increase in VEGF expression was observed as the tumor progressed from carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. It was observed that VEGF expression increased while the invasive tumor progressed from low grade to moderate grade, whereas VEGF expression decreased when it progressed from moderate to high grade.Statistically significant correlation among p53 with Ki-67, grade, diameter and opposite correlation between p53 and estrogen was found. There was increased p53 expressionin the in situ and invasive field of tumor.Conclusion: Similar p53 expression rates in in situ and invasive areas of the tumor may be helpful in predicting the behavior of the tumor in the in situ stage and in guiding the treatment. According to our data, the role of VEGF in tumor progression and its relationship with many prognostic factors is evident.

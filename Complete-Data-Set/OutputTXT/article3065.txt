The sanctuary is situated at the foothills of Pir Panjal mountain range (Inner Himalayas) in the southern escarpment of Kashmir’s Shopian District. The study was carried out from April to October 2021. A total number of 25 species from five families were recorded. The highest number of species were recorded from the family Nymphalidae followed by the family Pieridae. Additional field surveys and explorations in the upper reaches of the sanctuary will add further species to the butterfly inventory of the region.

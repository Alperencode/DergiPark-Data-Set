Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Blood Lactate Levels and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Taking Drugs for Suicide: A Retrospective and Descriptive Study
Özet: Introduction: Acute poisoning that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide is a preventable public health problem. In the evaluation of critically ill patients in emergencies, lactate is a useful biomarker. This study aims to investigate whether the mortality, morbidity, and intensive care hospitalization of patients presenting to the emergency department with drug intake for suicide can be determined by the blood lactate levels measured on admission.Material-Method: Patients over the age of 18 who presented to the emergency department between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020 due to acute poisoning were included in this single-center retrospective study. The relationship between the blood lactate levels measured on admission and the clinical outcome of the patient was examined. The student t-test was used to compare groups with normally distributed data, while the chi-square test was used for non-normally distributed or ordinal data. p˂0.05 was considered statistically significant.Findings: The data of 223 patients were analyzed. The median age was 28, and the female ratio was 68.6%. The most commonly ingested drugs were analgesics with 35%, other drugs with 33.6%, antidepressants with 24.7%, and other psychotropics with 22.4%. 192 of the patients were discharged following the treatment, 31 patients were admitted to the service or intensive care unit, and 3 patients died within the first 24 hours after the intensive care unit admission. When the factors related to hospitalization were examined, male gender, high mean age, high lactate level, and analgesic and other psychotropic drug intake were found to be related to hospitalization. On the other hand, old age (48.00, ±16.70), high lactate levels (6.77, ±6.52), and low bicarbonate levels (17.40, ±3.05) were associated with mortality.Conclusion: Blood lactate measured on admission is an important biomarker to predict both mortality and morbidity in patients presenting to the emergency department due to the use of drugs for suicidal purposes.

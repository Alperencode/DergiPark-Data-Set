Makale Başlığı: What is the role of YouTube™ as a source of information on trichotillomania?
Özet: Objective: YouTube™ is a very popular video site worldwide and is increasingly being used to access health information. The content in these videos is often incomprehensible and worse, contains inaccurate and incomplete information. This article aims to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of information about TTM available to patients on YouTube™.Material and Method: This study has a cross-sectional design. 51 videos were reviewed. Global quality score (GQS), modified DISCERN and trichotillomania Youtube score (TTMYS) were used for the quality analysis of the videos. Video duration(sec), time since upload (months), Number of views/comments/likes/dislikes were analyzed.Results: The majority of the videos (31.4%) were uploaded by physicians, and the least by hospitals (3.9%). The mean GQS score was 2.06±1.363, the modified DISCERN score was2.06±1.348, and the TTMYS score was 8.45±3.126. The GQS scores 1-2 (low quality), 3 (moderate quality), and 4-5 (high quality) were 68.6%, 11.8%, and 19.6%, respectively. The vast majority of videos were rated as low quality.Conclusion: The TTM related video content rewieved was largely inadequate. Information about the disease and treatment options were insufficient. It is necessary to either take a primary role in uploading high-quality videos or establish supervisory mechanisms for the security and accuracy of information.

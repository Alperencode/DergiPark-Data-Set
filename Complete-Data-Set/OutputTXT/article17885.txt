Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Alkali Modification on Some Properties of Particleboard Produced from Corn Stalks
Özet: The aim of this study is to recycle the corn stalks into the production cycle, which are used as animal feed, compost material or left as waste in the field without any use after harvest. For this purpose, it is planned to use corn stalks in particleboard production by modifying them. Lignocellulosic material obtained from corn (Zea mays indurate Sturt.) stalks was modified with 1, 3 and 5% NaOH solution. These modified parts were used in particleboard production. Some physical and mechanical properties of the obtained particle boards were investigated. At the end of the study, water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (TS) analysis showed that alkali treatments also decreased the water resistance of the produced particleboards. Using modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), and internal bond (IB) strength analysis, the mechanical properties of produced particleboards were evaluated. It was observed that the mechanical properties were improved by 1% alkali treatment, but the increasing alkali content decreased the mechanical properties.

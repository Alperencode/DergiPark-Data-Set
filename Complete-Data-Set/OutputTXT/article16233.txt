Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Geochemical Properties of Agates in Almus (Tokat) Region
Özet: Agates in the study area, located around the town of Almus in Tokat province, are found in the form of nodules along an approximately E-W trending fault within the volcanogenic sandstones of the Almus formation. The Upper Cretaceous aged Artova ophiolite complex, represented by metabasic and ultrabasic rocks on top of the Paleozoic aged Tokat metamorphics forming the basis of the study area, stands at the tectonic boundary, and the Haydaroğlu formation, which includes the Middle Eocene aged volcanogenic units, cuts and covers these older units. Sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, conglomerate and marine limestone containing volcanic materials belonging to older units, as well as the Lower Miocene aged Almus formation, which contains the agates, also unconformably overlie all units.Almus region agates contain on average 93.4%SiO2, 3.59%Fe2O3, 0.03%MgO, 0.72%CaO, 793 ppm Cr2O3, 11.98 ppm Ni, 13.4 ppm Cu, 4.69 ppm Pb, and 35.4 ppm Zn. They are associated with the ophiolite complex, while Cu, Pb and Zn are associated with the early stages of volcanism. The high Fe2O3 content in agates is associated with hematite and goethite which were transported into agates before SiO2 emplacement. The CaO in the agate is the product of the last phase of the solution forming the agate, and MgO is associated with the presence of dolomite.Field observations and geochemical evaluations of agates show that agates are epigenetically emplaced as a result of the circulation of SiO2, which is the main component due to hydrothermal activities that occurred after the rock formation of the Haydaroğlu formation, within the volcanogenic sandstones.

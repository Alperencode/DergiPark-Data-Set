Makale Başlığı: ANCESTOR OF AYDINOĞULLARI: AYDIN BEY AND HIS TOMB
Özet: One of the principalities established after the collapse of the Anatolian Seljuk State was the Aydınoğulları Beylik (Pricipality). Aydınoğulları Beylik (XIV. century) was established in Western Anatolia and played an important role in the Turkification and Islamization of the region.This study is about the name of Aydın Bey, who laid the foundations of Aydınoğulları Beylik, the origin of the “beylic” and Aydın Bey’s tomb. When the studies in this field are examined, it is seen that there is no clear information about where the name of the “beylik” comes from. Is Aydın a person’s name, a name of a place, or a tribe’s name? Also, who is Aydın Bey? Where is his grave? Where were the foundations of the “beylik” laid? The study was carried out in order to finding solutions to the on-going discussions about these questions and to contribute to the solution of questions and problems.The results of the study have been reached by following an interdisciplinary method through examining the studies carried out so far including field studies, toponymy, numismatics, historical geography, history disciplines in the knowledge of sources.The recommendations and conclusions reached by this study will make a new contribution to the solution of questions about Aydın Bey's life and his tomb.

Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF THE RELATIONSHİP BETWEEN QUALITY OF LIFE AND DIETARY ACID LOAD IN OBESE WOMEN
Özet: Objective: This study was conducted to determine the dietary acid load of obese women and to examine the relationship between dietary acid load, anthropometric measurements, and quality-of-life.Method: 140 volunteer adult individuals with body mass index 30-<40 kg/m² were included. To determine the food consumption status and the dietary acid load of the women, food consumption records were taken for three consecutive days (two days on weekdays, one day on the weekend). Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) were calculated by various algorithms based on food intake. The Obese-Specific Quality of Life Scale was used to determine the quality of life. The researcher measured body weight, height, waist, hip, and neck circumferences.Results: PRAL and NEAP scores increased with the increment in the degree of obesity but not significant for statistical (p>0.05). PRAL score in obese smokers was higher than the PRAL score of obese non-smokers (p<0.05). A negative correlation was detected between body weight and quality of life (r=-0.234, p=0.005). There was no significant relationship between quality of life and socio-economic status and constipation status and PRAL and NEAP scores (p>0.05).Conclusion: In this study, the dietary acid load increased with the increase in obesity. Smoking is another condition that increases dietary acid load. In addition, factors such as socioeconomic status and constipation also affect dietary acid load.  Besides, as the obesity status of individuals increases, the quality-of-life decreases. Therefore, attention should be paid on assessing dietary acid load and weight control when planning nutritional therapy in obese individuals.

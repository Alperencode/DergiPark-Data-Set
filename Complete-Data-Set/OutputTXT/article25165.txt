Makale Başlığı: Review essay: Can progressive education save America’s schools?
Özet: In Loving Learning: How Progressive Education Can Save America's Schools, Tom Little and Katherine Ellison describe Tom’s experiences, personal journey and knowledge of progressive education. During a pilgrimage to 45 progressive schools, Tom set out to visit schools that unabashedly called themselves progressive and asked the question, "What is progressive education?" This essay first reviews the book around six core strategies identified as progressive, and then provides a discussion in the context of 20th century curriculum ideologies. Differences between ideologies are what lead to the dualism that makes education divisive. The current state of education reveals a new surge for change. By avoiding the –isms that force the dichotomy in education, progressive education strategies can play a more central role in curriculum

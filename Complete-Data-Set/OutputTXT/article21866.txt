Makale Başlığı: The Effect of STEM and STEM-Based Robotics Activities on Constructive Learning Environments Opinions of Teacher Candidates
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of STEM and STEM-based robotic activities on constructivist learning environments in pre-service science teachers. The sample of this study, which was conducted in the 2018-2019 academic year, consists of 31 teacher candidates studying at the Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education. Mixed method was used in the study. A weak experimental design was used in the collection of quantitative data. In the research, "Constructivist Learning Environment Scale" was used in order to collect quantitative data.  In addition, an open-ended "semi-constructivist interview form" created by the researcher was used to obtain qualitative data. Quantitative data was paired sample t-test, qualitative data was used content analysis method. According to the findings obtained in the study, it was observed that the effect of STEM-based robotic coding activities of science teacher candidates on their views of constructivist learning environments showed a significant difference when their pretest-posttest scores were compared.  According to the qualitative data, it was observed that while the teacher candidates were doing STEM activities, their perspective on the events, the responsibilities they took with the methods and techniques they applied, and their associations with real life were observed to have a positive effect.

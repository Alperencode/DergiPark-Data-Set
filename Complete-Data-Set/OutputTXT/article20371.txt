Makale Başlığı: In search of education pertinent to the nature of world problems: A theoretical framework for social studies and geography education
Özet: World problems, with their multidimensional structure that expands the impact area from the local to the global scale, stand as an important struggle for existence of the humankind and require the collaborative effort of humanity for its solution. This study aims to provide a skill-based theoretical framework for the education of world problems, considering the nature of these problems and the needs of the global age we are in. The study was designed in line with the principles of the qualitative research approach. The source data were obtained through documents.  Descriptive analysis and content analysis were used in the data analysis. The study discusses the need to create new approaches to the education of world problems within the theoretical framework. With this perspective, appropriate skills for students and critical approaches to gain these skills have been attempted to be identified. As a result, it has been recommended that when organizing educational environments, an approach in which the characteristics of the world problems that have a multidimensional and dynamically expanding structure and that transcend borders are tackled in the context of local-global interactions is necessary for addressing the world problems. In this context, it is considered that implementing the approaches outlined in this study in Social Studies and Geography course curriculums and making them life skills of students would have substantial outcomes.

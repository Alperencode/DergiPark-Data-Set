Makale Başlığı: UNDERSTANDING THE CRIME OF CHILD TRAFFICKING
Özet: Under international law, child trafficking means the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a person under the age of 18 for the purposes of sexual exploitation, slavery, forced labor, servitude or exploitation, including removal of organs. Child trafficking, as an element of the crime of human trafficking, connects all countries and regions in an international crime network. Every year, children are smuggled from their homeland to other countries or within their own country, often from rural to urban areas. The crime of trafficking in children violates the human rights guaranteed to children in international law, especially the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Child trafficking, one of the fastest growing transnational crimes, threatens the survival and development of children and their right to education, health and protection. In this study, child trafficking, its common causes, its biopsychosocial effects on children and the general profile of its victims and the elements that should be focused on in the fight against child trafficking will be discussed from the persepective of social work discipline.

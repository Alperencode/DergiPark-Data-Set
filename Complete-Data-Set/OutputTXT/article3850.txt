Makale Başlığı: Spatial Organization of Social Order Between Political and Civil Elite: Four Different Madrasa Examples in Mamluk’s Cairo
Özet: The transfer of higher knowledge and the creation of an intellectual tradition in the history of Islamic civilization are understood to be directly related to the madrasa institution. This study aims to present a madrasa conceptualization through the example of four madrasas in Cairo. During the Mamluk Sultanate, madrasas had the characteristics of higher education institutions in which students from four madhhabs could be educated under the same roof. The sultans evidently established many of the madrasas built during the Mamluk Sultanate, and wealthy waqfs were allocated to these madrasas to maintain their scientific activities, which made an essential contribution to Cairo’s scientific life. The Mamluk political elite explicitly supported the ulama class that embodied the main force of the social structure as well as their scientific activities with the material resources allocated to them; these elite recognized the authority the ulama had over the society. Mamluk madrasas have such a complex structure that they do not have any single dimension, purpose, or function. The madrasas shed light on the historical course of the intellectual tradition that developed within the political, economic, social, and religious networks of the period and that had been shaped in line with the needs of the society.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Exopolysaccharide Producing Microorganisms in Maras Meat Sausages
Özet: Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are polysaccharides that synthesized extracellular by lactic acid bacteria as a result of fermentation. These polysaccharides have prebiotic characteristics, also in food industry they used as gelling agent, emulsifier, and stabilizer. Furthermore, they have positive effect on health because of digestive, cholesterol lowering, anti-tumor, anti-ulcer property. Also, they have generally recognized as safe (GRAS) property, for this reason their importance is rising. In fermented sucuk, lactic acid bacteria are dominant flora like many fermented products. In this study, lactic acid bacteria that produced exopolysaccharide in fermented sucuk and amount of exopolysaccharides produced by LAB which were dominant flora in that product was determined. For this purpose; LAB isolated from fermented sucuks which were obtained from 10 different butchers that were located in Kahramanmaraş. Phenol-sulphuric acid method was used for determination of amount of produced EPS. After that; characterization of LAB was made with PCR. As a result; Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Bacillus subtilis strains characterized from sausages that obtained from 10 different butchers in Kahramanmaraş. It was detected that; the amount of EPS which obtained from 56 strains was between 20.19-109.10 ppm. Also, it was detected that both of highest and lowest EPS producer strain was L. plantarum.

Özet: This book review concerns a study with eight chapters, which focuses on how the philosophical story of Ibn Tufayl, entitled Hayy b. Yaqzan, influenced the West. In the book, the author emphasizes that Arab-Islamic thought influenced Western Christian thought in many ways. The author follows the traces of this influence primarily through the literary works produced in the West. In addition, the novel character Hayy, who strips of all identities such as family, race, nation, and religion, seeks the truth through nature and mind. According to the author, this seeking influenced the development of religious thought in the West.

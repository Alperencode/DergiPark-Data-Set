Makale Başlığı: Review: Motif: From the Sadberk Hanım Museum Collection /Motif: Sadberk Hanım Müzesi Koleksiyonundan
Özet: Museum catalogs are full of opportunities. They are a natural complement to exhibitions, yet their purposes can be varied (and sometimes incongruous). Exhibitions are full of potential pathways for reaching different audiences.

How can that same level of intrigue and engagement be transmitted via the traditional paper- and-ink museum catalog?

Makale Başlığı: Cyprus Peace Operation in The Perspective of Responsibility to Protect
Özet: The use of military intervention against Humanitarian Crises during the Cold War was a concept that was limited in world politics and international law. Today, despite the theoretical and legal debates, sometimes by UN Security Council resolutions and sometimes by exceeding the only legitimate authorized institution of the use of force, states implement their responsibility to protect against third-party countries. Studies on the responsibility to protect, covering the history and theory of international relations, call the Cyprus Peace Operation a controversial example of humanitarian intervention in terms of the international community's reaction and the operation's legitimacy. Therefore, it will be examined within the framework of the responsibility to protect (R2P) in international political theory. In the 1990s, the International Relations literature defined humanitarian intervention as limiting the sovereignty of states against global atrocities. After the 2005 Earth Summit, R2P, third-party action against humanitarian crises, becomes a normative order-forming phenomenon. The phenomenon will allow us to examine the 1974 peace movement within the context of its responsibility to protect it. Discussions on the Cyprus Peace Operation under the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be used as the study's research method in the Parliamentary Budget Discussions.

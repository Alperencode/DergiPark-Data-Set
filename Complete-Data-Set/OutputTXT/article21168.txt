Makale Başlığı: An Ideologist Contributing to the Formation of Persian Nationalism: Mahmud Afşar
Özet: Nationalism, which has emerged in different forms throughout history, has been evident in the form of racism and chauvinism in the twentieth century. This form of nationalism, which has been influenced by many countries in the world, has also manifested itself in Iran. The idea of Persian Nationalism, which was defended under the name of the nation-building process with the accession of Reza Shah to the throne, was nourished and supported by many ideologists. Mahmud Afşar, who frequently emphasized this idea in her articles and in the magazine she published, was among the most important representatives of this idea.	In this study, Mahmud Afşar and her articles in Ayende magazine, which focuses on the goal of creating a central state and a national identity, are discussed. In addition, the practices of Reza Shah within the scope of Persian Nationalism were mentioned. It was determined that Persian Nationalism was frequently emphasized in the journal Ayende, which is one of the important sources of the period discussed in the study. In other various sources, it has been seen that Reza Shah carried out some practices within the scope of this nationalism.

Makale Başlığı: Adaptive Fuzzy Logic based MPPT Control for PV System Under Partial Shading Condition
Özet: Partial shading causes power loss, hotspots and threatens the reliability of the Photovoltaic generation system. Moreover characteristic curves exhibit multiple peaks. Conventional MPPT techniques under this condition often fail to give optimum MPP. Focusing on the afore mentioned problem an attempt has been made to design an Adaptive Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System based Fuzzy Logic Control MPPT.The mathematical model of PV array is simulated using in MATLAB/Simulink environment.Various case studies related to inhomogeneous insolation and temperature has been investigated. For justifying the efficacy of the proposed MPPT technique a comparative analysis has been done with two popular MPPT techniques.

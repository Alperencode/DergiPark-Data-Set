Makale Başlığı: New Evidence-Based Physiotherapy Approaches in the Treatment of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome in the Last Five Years
Özet: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is defined as anterior knee pain during activities that are loaded with joint loads such as crouching, running, climbing, up and down stairs due to knee overload during flexion and extension. There is no gold standard in clinical diagnosis. Other possible problems are eliminated and diagnosis is made. In conservative treatment nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, knee brace, taping, stretching and strengthening applications are performed. As an exercise program, the most effective method in patients with PFAS is to combine quadriceps and proximal hip exercises. In order to determine new treatments used in PFPS, ‘‘patellofemoral pain syndrome’’, ‘‘patellofemoral pain syndrome treatment’’, ‘‘intervention for patellofemoral pain syndrome’’ were written and screened in PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct database. The scanning start date is 2016, and all the researches on the subject up to 30 November 2021 in the determined databases were examined. In this research, the treatments used in PFPS and new approaches in treatment are emphasized. New studies, guidelines show that new approaches that can be effective in PFPS can be used. 5. In the international patellofemoral pain treatment consensus decisions, it was mentioned that gait retrain and blood flow restricted exercises could be used as new treatment options in PFPS. In addition, in recent studies, it has been stated that vacuum and elastrometric knee braces and technology supported theraband, body vibration training can be used.

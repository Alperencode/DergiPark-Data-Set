Makale Başlığı: The Sensory and Evaluation of Seaweed (Spirulina) to be Used as Food Supplement Production in Grissini
Özet: Seaweed and algal products constitute a special part of the diet in many countries of the world and DHA, mucopolysaccharides and various vitamins have been produced. Seaweeds are among functional foods with high fiber structure and low cholesterol content, with high nutritional quality.In this study, spirulina was used as a food additive in the production of grissin, which is an important part of dietary nutrition. Spirulina, which is rich in protein, fatty acid, nutritional value, and vitamins, was investigated as a new product of dietary nutrition. The two groups formed (Grissini with Sade and Grissini with Spirulina) were evaluated by sensory and physical analyzes.It has been determined that spirulina added grissins are sensually indistinguishable from plain grissin and can be consumed, and are more fragile and brittle as a result of physical analysis. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that spirulina added grissins are physically more robust than spirulina, they do not have a sensory flavor difference, but they have low sensory points due to their green color, and they are different from the general bakery product character because they are greener according to color analysis.

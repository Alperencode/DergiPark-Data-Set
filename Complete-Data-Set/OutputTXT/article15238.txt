Makale Başlığı: VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY of THE TURKISH VERSION of PERITRAUMATIC DISTRESS INVENTORY (PDI)
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to translate the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) to Turkish and investigate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version. The sample of the research is 377 people in the 18-65 age group. The validity and reliability analyses of the Turkish form of the scale were conducted through 224 participants who stated that they have experienced traumatic events, and comparison analyses were carried out by including all participants (377). In addition to the Turkish version of Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), the participants were applied to the Demographic Information Form and Impact of Event Scale-R (IES-R). As a result of the analysis, the Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient for the whole scale was determined as .88, while the internal consistency coefficient of the negative emotions sub-dimension was found to be .84, and the internal consistency coefficient of the perceived life threat and physical arousal sub-dimension was found as .80. As a result of the confirmatory factor analysis, it was calculated as CMIN / DF = 2.54, GFI = .91, CFI = .91, SRMR = .07 and RMSEA = .08. A moderately positive (r = 46, p <.001) relationship was found between the Peritraumatic Stress Scale and the Impact of Events Scale. When the relationship between total score of the scale and its sub-dimensions is examined, the total scale score and negative emotions relation was determined as r = .92, p <.001; perceived threat of life and physical arousal relation was found to be positively high at the level of r = .88, p <.001. In addition, two sub-dimensions, negative emotions, perceived threat of life and physical arousal were found to be moderately positive at the level of r = .62, p <.001. The high internal consistency of the PDI Turkish form was interpreted as it is a valid and a reliable measurement tool of the Turkish form of the scale for adults (18-65 years old) based on the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.

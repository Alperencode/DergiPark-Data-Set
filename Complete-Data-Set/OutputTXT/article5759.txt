Makale Başlığı: A Meta Synthesis Study of Postgraduate Thesis using Lesson Study in Turkey
Özet: The study aims to explore the current status of the postgraduate thesis conducted in Turkey on the Lesson Study model, which is the concept of teachers' professional development. Theses related to the lesson study professional development model were searched using the keywords "lesson research" and "lesson study" in the database of “The Council of Higher Education National Thesis Center”.  A total of 36 thesis studies were identified with the specified keywords. Out of 22 doctoral dissertations and 8 master thesis published between 2012-2020, which meet the research criteria, were included in the research. The results of the studies included in the research were analyzed by content analysis using the meta-synthesis technique. With meta-synthesis studies, the aim is to handle the studies in a specific field on a qualitative basis, and to present the similarities and differences comparatively. As a result of the analysis, four dimensions were revealed: the topics covered by the teachers at study meetings, difficulties faced in lesson study, the contributions of the lesson study and recommendations about the lesson study. The results of the study are thought to provide great convenience in terms of being a comprehensive resource for researchers who will work in the field of “lesson study”, which is a professional development model and for beginning a wider perspective for them.

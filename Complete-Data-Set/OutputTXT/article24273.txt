Makale Başlığı: ISOLATED ACETABULAR OSTEOCHONDROMA OF THE HIP
Özet: Osteochondromas, even though, are the most common osteo-cartilaginous tumours but they have been rarely reported to be intra-articular. These intra-articular osteochondromas become symptomatic much earlier than their extra-articular counterparts. We present a case of isolated intra-acetabular osteochondroma in a 21 year old male who presented with history of right hip pain for 5 years and difficulty in walking. Patient was managed with excision of intra-articular exostoses through surgical hip dislocation. Intra-articular hip osteochondromas in adults have not been reported in literature adequately and the surgical management of this condition is not described and discussed well, so far. Osteochondroma can be a rare cause of hip pain in patients with unexplained etiology. Since isolated acetabular osteochondroma occurs rarely, their diagnosis and management can be challenging. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0169This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

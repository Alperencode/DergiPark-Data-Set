Makale Başlığı: Infinite Distractibility: Focusing on Social Media in Everyday Life
Özet: The work titled Infinite Distraction – Paying Attention to Social Media by Dominic Pettman discusses new forms of social relations created by the use of social media, which has become an important part of our lives as a result of the development of communication technologies, and what kind of an individual these usage practices create. According to Pettman, the intense use of social media in everyday life causes an infinite distraction in the individual. Individual-specific network protocol based on algorithmic data condemns individuals to a cycle of obligation, distraction, procrastination, and addiction. In his study, Pettman seeks an answer to the question “What makes humans different from bots?” by evaluating individuals based on their online behavior. The study examines how we live life synchronized in this click-based new order and in what way our virtual world boundaries are determined by algorithms. Pettman discusses the changes he labels as “digitalization of distraction” through conceptualizations such as hypermodulation, hypersynchronization and algorithm in his work. This book review covers Pettman’s digitalization of distraction and its technological-cultural reflections.

Makale Başlığı: The Linguistic Activities of Contemporary Arab Language Researchers Showing Interest In Modern Linguistics and Their Positions Towards The Classical Arabic Language Tradition
Özet: Contemporary Arab linguists differ from each other in terms of including the classical Arabic language (CAL) tradition and linguistics in their studies. Assuming that the CAL tradition and linguistics are two different thought systems, we can categorize these studies under the following three categories: Studies that examine Arabic through CAL sciences, studies that examine Arabic through linguistics, and studies examining Arabic using both approaches. This article aims to examine the second category with the objective of exploring the activities carried out in Arabic linguistics, the motivations of contemporary Arab linguists to show interest in linguistics instead of the CAL tradition and the positions Arab linguists hold against the CAL tradition. To fulfill this aim, in the first section, linguistic activities of Arab language researchers are categorized under four titles: Studies introducing linguistics to the Arab world, studies in theoretical linguistics, studies in other linguistic fields such as applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, and Arabic linguistic journals. In the second section, the positions of these linguists towards this tradition are evaluated. Additionally, the factors behind their interest in linguistics are discussed and their motivations are justified by their acceptance of scientific progress as cumulative, continuous, and linear.

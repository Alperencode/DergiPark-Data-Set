Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATON OF BRITISH-RUSSIAN RELATIONS DURING THE OPENING OF THE DARDANELLES FRONT
Özet: Dardanalles Front, one of the fronts of the First World War, is one of the points where Russia and England wanted to dominate the Ottoman lands for more than a century. After the Reval Talks held in 1908 on the Turkish Straits region, a decision was reached between the two countries. As a result of this decision, the straits would be given to Russia, which had dreamed of domination in the region since Petro I. But the beginning of the war caused problems in this sensitive and new alliance between the two countries. From the start of the war until March 18, 1915, every step taken was a period in which the established alliance was questioned and the country's interests were prioritized.Contrary to the military wing of the Dardanelles Front, which was examined in detail in this study, the atmosphere of the political conflicts of interest in England and Russia before the opening of the front line was examined. In this direction, the problems of mutual trust in the opening of the front and the attitudes of the two countries in the face of these problems were included in the speeches of the British War Council and the Russian Assembly, starting before the First World War.

Makale Başlığı: JUDGE’S INTERVENTION TO EXCESSIVE COMPETITION PROHIBITION
Özet: The agreements that include the condition that the employee is prohibited from using information belonging to an employer, such as customer data or secrets regarding production which he has learnt during the employment contract, in a certain place, time and area of activity, in a way to create competition with the employer, are non-competition agreements. Noncompetition agreements protect the employer on the one hand and restrict the workers' freedom to work, which is protected by the Constitution, on the other. Therefore, non-competition agreements are subject to some formal requirements. However, some restrictions have been imposed on the noncompetition agreements in terms of place, time, and type of work. If these restrictions are not complied with, the judge has been given the authority to limit the excessive prohibition of competition. The non-competition agreements that do not contain any restrictions should be evaluated within the scope of the Turkish Civil Code article 23 and Turkish Code of Obligation article 27. In this study, non-competition agreements, the effects of restrictions in the non-competition agreements and excessive competition prohibition by the judge are examined.

Makale Başlığı: Alternative Stabilizers Used in Ice Cream Production
Özet: Stabilizers are commercial substances that are used to increase the desired viscosity and volume in ice cream production to improve texture, melting qualities, prolong shelf life by preventing recrystallization during storage. Nowadays, new studies are being gained for bringing stabilizer materials obtained from different sources to the industry day by day. In this study, besides the stabilizers used in ice cream technology, stabilizer sources which have a potential in ice cream production, such as basil seed gum, quince seed extract powder, chia seed gel, microbial exopolysaccharides and cellulose derivates gained from different sources were reviewed. Industrial potentials were evaluated by mentioning the effects of these components, which are regarded as new stabilizers, on ice cream properties and their synergistic effects with other stabilizers.

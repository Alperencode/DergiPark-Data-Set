Makale Başlığı: The Psychometric Properties of the Turkish Version of the Olympic Value Scale and Investigation of the Society's Perceptions of Olympic Value
Özet: In the study, it was aimed to bring the Olympic Value Scale to Turkish literature and to examine the value perceptions of individuals within the scope of this scale. In the first stage, the psychometric properties of the Olympic Value Scale were evaluated and the validity and reliability of the scale in Turkish culture was tested with a study group of 354 participants. For the original scale consisting of 3 factors, 12 items and graded in a 7-point Likert type, first of all, the stages of translation, synthesis, back translation, pre-test and expert evaluation were applied. The construct validity of the scale in Turkish culture was tested with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was taken as a reference for the reliability analyzes of the scale, and the total test correlations of the items were examined. It has been understood that the Olympic Value Scale indicates a structure consistent with the original scale and it has been concluded that the scale provides a valid and reliable structure in Turkish culture. In the second stage of the research, the value perceptions of 1255 participants living in Turkish culture towards the Olympics were examined within the scope of some socio-demographic characteristics by using the Olympic Value Scale. A significant difference was determined in favor of the group with licensed sportsperson experience in the sub-dimensions of "Friendly Relations with Others" and "Appreciation of Diversity". In the educational status variable, a significant difference was found in the sub-dimensions of "Friendly Relations with Others" and "Achievement in Competition" in favor of the participants with a high school or lower education level.

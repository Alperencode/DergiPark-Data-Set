Özet: The aim of this study is to explore to be compared the styles of the democratic, the autocratic and the laissez-faire leadership that are tried to be displayed by public and private school principals via teachers’ views. The universe of the study consists of the teachers working in public and private schools in the central districts of Konya in the 2018- 2019 academic year. The Leadership Style Scale of School Principals developed by Kılıç and Yılmaz (2018) was used to obtain the data. The data were obtained from 420 teachers randomly through a scale within the framework of the quantitative research approach. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there was a significant difference between the democratic, the autocratic and the laissez-faire leadership styles displayed by public and private school principals. In the democratic leadership style, the mean score reached by the principals working in private schools was higher than the mean score of the principals working in the public sector. On the other hand, in the autocratic and the laissez-faire leadership styles, it was determined that the mean score of the principals working in public schools was higher than the mean score of the principals working in private schools. While the highest mean score belonged to the school principals working in public schools in the autocratic leadership style, it was concluded that the lowest point mean score belonged to the private school principals in the laissez-faire leadership style.

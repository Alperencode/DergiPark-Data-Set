Makale Başlığı: In the Context of End-Text Information of the Narrations in Humaydi’s Musnad A Contribution to Sufyān b. ʿUyayna’s Hadithism
Özet: In order to present a comprehensible view of the history of hadith, besides the studies on methodology, biography works and hadith commentary, the issues in the isnads and the end-of-text information should be evaluated. The information contained in the isnads can give a great deal of insight into the history of hadith, especially the issues discussed in the gatherings of hadith lessons. On the other hand, the information and notes at the end of the narrations with the isnad are also very valuable in terms of seeing the hidden parts of the history of hadith. In our research, which was written in this context, almost most of the narrations in al-Ḥumaydî’s Musnad written by Sufyân b. ʿUyayna’s notes were examined and it was aimed to contribute to the hadithism of Sufyān, who lived in a critical time in terms of hadith history. These notes, which contain signs about Sufyan's hadithism, of which taʿdīl expressions are usually included in the ṭabaqāt's works, were first identified, then classified and the boundaries of the subject were tried to be determined . In this context, it has been seen that the end-of-text notes can be divided into five main headings. Three of these titles are not included in our study because they have similarities with the works of the period with similar content in using the same methods and process, as well as not presenting a different appearance from their contemporaries.

Makale Başlığı: Urbanization models suitable for thermal-bioclimatic comfort levels
Özet: Scientific and technological developments triggered by industrialization started an intense urbanization process, which brought along an increase in population rate and urban structuring. Structural surface materials with low albedo (reflectance) value such as concrete and asphalt, which are used as building materials in urban areas, have trapped the heat inside, causing an increase in the air temperature in the city. The fact that a city is warmer than the surrounding rural areas is described as an urban heat island phenomenon. This phenomenon negatively affects the people living in the city physically and mentally. It is defined as Bioclimatic Comfort when people are not warned against the atmospheric conditions of the city they are in and feel comfortable. According to the PET index chart created by Matzarakis and Höppe, it has been revealed that people feel better between 18.1 - 23.0 ̊C temperature values. The increase or decrease in these values causes people living in the city to feel more stressed mentally and to feel a decrease in their desire to work, while physical health problems such as eye burns and nosebleeds occur. In this study, the bioclimatic comfort conditions of Kahramanmaraş, where the Mediterranean climate is intensely felt, are discussed. Meteorological measurement data of the study area between 1970 and 2021 were obtained from meteorological stations in the region. In line with these data, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed maps were created and then correlated with PET index values.

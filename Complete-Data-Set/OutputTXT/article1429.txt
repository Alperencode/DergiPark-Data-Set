Makale Başlığı: A Research on Geographically Indicated Kerebiç Dessert in the Scope of Sustainable Gastronomy
Özet: Kerebiç dessert is one of the local products identified with Mersin and registered as a geographical indication. In this research, the characteristics of the Kerebiç dessert were investigated within the scope of sustainable gastronomy. This study was carried out in the central districts of Mersin in 13 businesses that produce Kerebiç dessert including 10 Kerebiç chefs, 2 business owners and 1 sales representative. It was applied by the semi-structured interview technique and face-to-face interview technique. The study identified that none of the participants knew that the Kerebiç dessert is a regional product of Mersin with geographical indication. The interview highlighted that the registered recipe does not show any similarity with their own recipes. Besides, there were great differences in cooking techniques and cooking times. Under the light of this information, Kerebiç dessert was produced separately in distinct manufacturing environments on 17.09.2021 with the recipe registered by the Turkish patent institute in 2019 and with the recipe obtained as a result of face-to-face interviews with the semi-structured interview technique on 15.10.2021. The comparison of the product has been made and information about its features has been given.

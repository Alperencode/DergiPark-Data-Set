Makale Başlığı: Reinterpretation of Maslow's Theory of Needs Model as an Integrated Process
Özet: ABSTRACT  Maslow's theory of needs underlies the development of contemporary motivation theories and it still guides and serves as a source for the explanation of executive employee motivation in both academia and practical business life. Criticisms of Maslow's theory of needs essentially consist of widespread and superficial criticisms of the hierarchical structure of the theory of needs and the self-actualization phase. In other words, the criticisms made consist of a number of reductionist approaches and criticisms that do not contain any falsifications about the model itself. In this context, the most important feature that distinguishes this study from others is that a new interpretation has been introduced for the reconstruction of the model together with the critique. For this reason, firstly, the theory of needs model as proposed by Maslow will be explained in this study by using primary sources. Then the criticisms of the hierarchical structure of the model will be collected and the self-actualization phase of the model will be re-examined from a sophisticated point of view. In the last part, a new interpretation of the model will be presented in the form of an integrated set of needs.

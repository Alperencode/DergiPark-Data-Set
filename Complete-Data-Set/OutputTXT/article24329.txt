The clinical outcome of the cases usagewith toxic doses metformin for suicide was investigated in this study. The databelonging to the cases usage with overdose metformin for suicide betweenSeptember 2009 and May 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. Ten patients werewomen all of the 15 patients. Median ages were 34 years (18-68) and 38 (23-58)years in women and men, respectively. Median dose of metformin was 19.5 g (8.5-30.0) and 24.0 g (14.0-50.0) inwomen and men. Six of 15patients (40%) were diabetics and they had used their drugsfor suicide. Eleven patients (74%) were administered intravenous fluids andfour patients (26%) were applied dialysis. The median dose for metformin was 32.0 g (20.0-50.0)and 17.0 g (8.5-22.0) in dialyzed and non-dialyzed patients. Hyperlactatemiawas detected in one patient but no renal failure or lactic acidosis. Therewere tachypnea in four patients (26%) and hypotension in two patients (13%).All of these patients with tachypnea and/or hypotension were dialyzed.Pancreatitis, cardiac arrest or death was seen none of the patients. All of thepatients have no need to dialysis at the hospital discharge and their renalfunction tests were normal. If it is not contraindicated, metformin is a drugused safely in diabetic patients. Severe side effects are very rare used intherapeutic doses whereas lethal adverse events may be seen in very high dosestaken acutely. Close monitoring and dialysis are life saving approaches inthese situations.

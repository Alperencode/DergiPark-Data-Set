Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMPLE OF A GROUP OF WOVEN PRAYER RUG FROM THE HAKKÂRİ REGION OF THE 20TH CENTURY
Özet: Hakkâri is one of the richest provinces of Anatolia in terms of weaving. Living conditions, climate and means of livelihood have been effective in development and diversification of weaving. Due to geographical features of Hakkâri area, ovine breeding is preferred. Using the wool material obtained from these animals, they have produced objects that they can use in daily life such as carpets, rugs, mêzer and prayer rugs. World-renowned Hakkâri weavings are significant tangible cultural assets connecting the past to today and even future. In this study, woven prayer rugs are discussed. Field study was conducted in central Hakkâri; Çukurca, Yüksekova, Derecik and Şemdinli districts and villages. As a result of the field study, thirty-three specimens were found. In this study, fourteen prayer rugs are discussed in catalogue section and assessed according to their technique, pattern, colour and composition features. Classification and documentation studies are done for prayer rugs which contain mystical meanings, have a significant place among traditional Turkish handcrafts and were not studied before.

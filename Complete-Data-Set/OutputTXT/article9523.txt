Makale Başlığı: How Do Career Decision Regret and Work-Related Quality of Life Predict Organizational Commitment?
Özet: The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of career decision regret with work-related quality of life on organizational commitment. The research is limited to the opinions of teachers from school staff. In this study, a correlational survey method was used. The research was carried out in the province of Denizli in Turkey. In the research, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the extent to which teachers' organizational commitment was predicted by their career decision regrets and quality of work life. To determine which of the independent variables make a significant contribution to predicting the level of organizational commitment, a stepwise regression method was applied. First, it was examined whether the responses from the scales were normally distributed. It has also been investigated whether there are multicollinearity connections between the data. According to the results of the research, it has been found that job and career satisfaction is a significant predictor of calculative commitment. The strongest predictor of the moral commitment variable is job and career satisfaction. Moral commitment was found to be negatively associated with career decision regret. However, it has been found that the sub-dimensions of work-life quality, job and career satisfaction, job control, and general well-being perception have a positive effect on moral commitment.

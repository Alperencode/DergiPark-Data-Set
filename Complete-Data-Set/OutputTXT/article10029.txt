Makale Başlığı: Protective Effect of Metformin Alone or in Combination with Valproic acid on Pentylenetetrazole-Induced Seizures in Mice
Özet: AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of metformin on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and the neuroprotective effect of metformin on neuronal damage after pentylenetetrazole administration.Material and Methods: Thirty-five (35) Male BALB-c Albino mice weighing 35-38 g were divided randomly into five groups: Control group (1), Saline+PTZ group (2), Valproic Acid (VPA, 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal-i.p.)+PTZ group (3), Metformin (200 mg/kg i.p.)+PTZ group (4), and VPA+Metformin+PTZgroup (5). The PTZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 30 min after drugs injection to induce seizures and seizure stages and behavioral scoring were evaluated. After completing procedure, brain tissues were removed and analyzed with biochemical and histopathological procedures. The hippocampal Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1, CA2, CA3 and DG (dentate gyrus) regions were histopathologically evaluated and oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS)) were measured.Results: Compare to Saline+PTZ group, metformin administration alone did not affect the onset time of the first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), but combination of VPA and metformin significantly increased FMJ onset time (p<0.05). Additionally, the treatment of metformin with or without VPA reduced the brain oxidativestress (p<0.05). Furthermore, histopathological assessment demonstrated that metformin administration and the combination of VPA and metformin decreased dark neuron formation in the hippocampal CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG areas (p<0.05).Conclusion: Metformin was found to be significantly effective in reducing epileptic seizures, brain oxidative stress, and preventing neural damage after PTZ-induced seizure

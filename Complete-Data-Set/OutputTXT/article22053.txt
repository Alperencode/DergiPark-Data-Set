Makale Başlığı: Review of the City of the Sun from the Point of Classical Management Theory
Özet: The City of the Sun, first published in 1602 and considered the most substantial work of its author Tomasso Campanella, is a writing that is shaped by the scientific dabates of the era.  The focus on being scientific, which is cultivated throughout Campanella’s work, is also the building block of the Classical Management Theory. Another point where the book and the Classical Management Theory align is that both emerged to respond to the needs of their times, which were ripe for evolution. Classical Theory’s objective of achieving productivity takes the form of sustaining the system in the City of the Sun. Thus, some parallels appear in their ways to achieve the ends. This book review discusses the mentioned similarities within several themes, namely, production and transmission of knowledge, prominence of simplicity and standardization, guiding the agents –the community in the book and laborers in the Classical Management Theory- towards common interest and, lastly, the expectations regarding executive branch.

Makale Başlığı: The impact of climate change on climatological, meteorological, and hydrological disasters in Iran
Özet: Climate change adversely affects the environment and human life in many respects. The evidencefor climate change on earth is quite solid and convincing. Observable rises in sea levels,melting of a glacier’s ice, the regression of the glacial areas, critical changes in annual precipitationpatterns, and global warming increases are specific evidence of climate change. Scientificstudies and experimental findings indicate the role of human effects as a primary reasonfor the changes since the middle of the 20th century. The disproportionate use of fossil fuelsresulted in the rapid increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without a significantdecrease in greenhouse gas levels, predictions demonstrate that the World’s average temperatureincrease may reach 6.4 °C by 2100, and the associated disaster hazards will graduallyincrease. Iran is among the countries that experience significant increases in climate changeeffects on the environment and society. Between 1900-and 1980, the number of reporteddisasters per year was below 100, whereas the annual number of disasters reached 400 between2000 and 2019. Studies show that climate change is the main reason for disasters suchas floods, storms, droughts, land subsidence, and wildfires in Iran. With approximately 687million tons of CO2 production, Iran ranks first country responsible for climate change in theMiddle East and the sixth country in the World. It is noted that without necessary precautions,the increase in climate-related disasters will be much higher in the next ten years.

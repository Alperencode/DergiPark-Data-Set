Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of energy efficient building design and parameters with RIBA plan of work
Özet: For energy efficient building design, a roadmap is needed to apply sustainability and comfort conditions in buildings. Today, there are many certification systems, research, recommendations and regulations for energy efficient building design. Creating a work plan by carrying out the design process in stages will bring great convenience to the work done in order to meet the energy needs of the buildings and the comfort needs of the users. In this context, it is important to have a plan in stages, taking into account the function of the building.In this study, energy efficient building design and its parameters are examined and the RIBA (British Royal Institute of Architects) plan of work stages, strategies and proposed parameters for energy efficient design are evaluated.Firstly, a literature review on energy efficient building design and parameters is made and the parameters are listed under sub-headings. Then, the parameters of energy efficient building design and the stages of the RIBA plan of work were compared, and their overlapping and diverging aspects were evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: A Critical Reading of the Mass Ornament from the Gender Perspective
Özet: As an unconscious surface-level expression of the Fordist era, the mass ornament is a phenomenon that objectifies both its producer and consumer. By mechanizing the human through anonymization and asexualization, this propaganda instrument that serves the construction of one-dimensional man diminishes the subject's originality. The serial combinations of women produced by the culture and gender policy widely in Europe and the USA determine the status of the “new woman” in modern life while producing a social fantasy. The culture industry especially objectifies women and transfers control over them to men. This supervision also aims to determine the limits of the economy of desire and eroticism in society. Sociologist and cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer, in his Mass Ornament (1963), examines the Taylorist ballet, which became a worldwide aesthetic reflex at the end of the nineteenth century, fetishizing the ever-new without producing a new value with synchronized body movements. Kracauer, who explored the meanings of the aesthetic images produced by the society pointed to the culture industry by developing a critical perspective on mass culture by establishing the connection between working life and mass production and the structures in entertainment culture. This article offers a feminist reading on the concept of mass ornament by considering the modern culture of the 1920s from a gender perspective. It adds another layer to Kracauer’s critique of mass ornament and opens it up for discussion, emphasizing the transitivity between the aesthetic and the political.

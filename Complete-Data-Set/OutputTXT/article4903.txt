Makale Başlığı: The Promise Of Hegemonic Masculunity As A Call To War: An Examination On World War I. Posters
Özet: Wars play an important role in producing and circulating patterns of gender norms and pave the way for men to establish power not only over women but also over other men. Propaganda carried out in times of war contributes to the construction of hegemonic masculinity, which is considered the most honorable way to be a man and requires all other masculinities to position themselves according to this form of masculinity. Governments, which are expected to be one of the main advocates of gender equality, promise an idealized image of hegemonic masculinity to men fighting in times of war, implying that men will be in a superior and respected position both over women and over other men who do not participate in the war. In this respect, when men join the war, they will not only protect their homeland, women and children, but also dominate over other men who do not participate in the war, and thus they will be rewarded with hegemonic masculinity, which is the most idealized form of being a man. This study aims to analyze the war posters used in the First World War, which is the first known example of total war in world history and also known as propaganda wars, in the context of hegemonic masculinity conceptualization, and in this way, to reveal the images of hegemonic masculinity these posters carry. In this study, 10 propaganda posters used in the World War I Period were analyzed with the semiotic analysis, and the findings were examined in the context of hegemonic masculinity conceptualization. According to the findings obtained in the research, it is determined that the propaganda posters published during the World War I period spread the values of idealized hegemonic masculinity, and the men who actively participated in the war were promised power over both women and other men who did not participate in the war.

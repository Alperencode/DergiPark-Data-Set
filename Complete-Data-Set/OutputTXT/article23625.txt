Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Young Football Players’ Sprint, Agility, and Dribbling Performances on Natural Grass and Artificial Grass
Özet: This study aimed to investigate the comparison of young football players’ sprint, agility, and dribbling performances on natural grass and artifıcial grass. Sixteen healthy young football players (age: 14.01 ± 0.29 years; training age: 4.31 ± 1.74 years; height: 166.68 ± 6.93 cm; weight: 55.48 ± 8.16 kg) participated in the study voluntarily. Sprint, agility (change of direction), and dribbling tests were applied to the research group on artificial turf and natural turf in five trial days. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine whether the values of the variables had a normal distribution. In comparisons of all data, paired sample t-test was applied for within-group comparisons. The significance level was taken as p < .05. While there was a statistically significant difference between the artificial turf-natural turf sprint values (3.17 ± 0.13 s; 3.26 ± 0.14 s) and agility values (11.11 ± 0.33 s; 11.24 ± 0.38 s) of the research group (p < .05), there was no statistically significant difference between dribbling values (21.17 ± 1.29 s; 21.52 ± 0.89 s) (p > .05). As a result, the sprint and agility performance data on artificial turf and natural turf in young football players showed that there was a significant difference in favor of artificial turf, but there was no significant difference between dribbling performances.

Makale Başlığı: Mapping of Gradient Patterns Generated with Helmholtz Coils for Localized Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia
Özet: Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is a new generation cancer treatment method under development. One of the challenges that arise in the practical applications of MFH is the limited control of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP). In order to overcome this problem, new approaches are being investigated in MFH tests. Localization of MNP oscillations can be achieved through static magnetic field-free region (FFR) and static magnetic field (SMF) gradients generated by permanent magnets or electromagnets. In this study, Helmholtz coils were used as SMF source to generate gradient patterns (GPs). Finite element method simulation was used to predict GPs that would emerge in the study area. An experiment platform was produced in which the GP would be generated with parametric current changes. Measurements were taken when source currents were (1.1, 1.1 ), (2.2, 2.2), (4.4, 4.4) and (2.2, -2.2) A, respectively. It was observed that FFR form could be manipulated with coil current. The mapping of the GPs and determining FFRs for the use of localized MFH were discussed for the first time in this study. The findings provide insight into which GP is appropriate in which situations in localized MFH.

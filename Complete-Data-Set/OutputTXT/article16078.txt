Makale Başlığı: Focusing on Problem Solution with Five Dimensions
Özet: Therapy, which is a relationship-based learning style should be for a specific purpose between subjects within a certain period of time. We are social beings by nature. Interacting and relating with others is a result of our nature. This relationship experience, created by two people in an area in the therapy room, undertakes the task of rearranging one’s self.Psychological difficulties are the problems experienced during the contact of the individual and the environment. These problems determine the beginning and the process of the therapeutic relationship. The ability to react to the problems experienced requires psychological resilience. One of the goals of the therapeutic relationship is to rebuild psychological resilience.Psychological resilience can be defined as emotional resilience, endurance in the face of difficult situations, and the ability to adapt to the situations. Problems experienced during interpersonal contact increase the ability to develop self-awareness, ability to focus, emotion regulation skills, and problem-solving skills. This work offers methods, techniques, and materials on how to make this reorganization through relationship-based learning that takes place in the therapy room.

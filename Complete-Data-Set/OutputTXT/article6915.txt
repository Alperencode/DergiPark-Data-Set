Makale Başlığı: Frequency of Osteoporosis/Osteopenia, Vitamin D Levels and  Associated Risk Factors in HIV/AIDS Patients
Özet: Background: Decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) is common in individuals infected with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and the rate of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fracture risk are higher than the gene-ral population. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of osteoporosis/osteopenia according to the results of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and examination of associated risk factors and also evaluate the results of 25 (OH) vitamin D.Materials and Methods: The files of HIV-infected patients we followed up in our clinic between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with DXA results and 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were evaluated within the scope of the study. Age, gender, mode of transmission, smoking, CD4 T lymphocyte levels, HIV RNA levels of the cases were compared according to BMD results.Results: The average age of 146 patients with BMD results was found 44, and the CD4 T lymphocyte was 399. Osteoporosis was diagnosed in nine (6%) patients and osteopenia was diagnosed in 44 (30%) patients. 49% of patients diagnosed as   osteoporosis/osteopenia were under the age of 50. There was no statistically significant difference between the osteoporosis/osteopenia group and the group with normal BMD in terms of gender, CD4 T lymphocyte count and HIV viral load. 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were found as 85/116 (73%) between 0-20, 24/116 (20%) between 21-30 and 7/116 (6%) above 30.Conclusions: In our study, a significant decrease in BMD and severe vitamin D deficiency were found in a signifi-cant portion of our HIV-infected patients. Especially in  young patient group for whom screening is not recom-mended. It should be considered that the incidence of osteoporosis/osteopenia may be high. Without ignoring the effects of vitamin D on immunomodulatory and bone health, we think replacement therapy should be applied to patients with deficiency.Keywords: Osteopenia, Osteoporosis, 25(OH)vitamin D, HIV

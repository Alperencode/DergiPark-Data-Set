Makale Başlığı: Moderation And Mediation Role of Teaching Image In The Relationship Between Preferring Teaching And Attitude
Özet: The aim of this research is to examine the mediation and moderation role of the professional image of teaching in the relationship between teacher candidates' attitudes towards the teaching profession and their reasons for choosing the teaching profession. For this purpose, the research was conducted through a correlational model based on the quantitative research approach. The sample of the study consists of 663 pre-service teachers selected by convenient sampling method. Data collection tools consist of the scale of attitude towards teaching, the scale of choosing the teaching profession, and the scale of teaching image. In the analysis of the collected data, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, generalized linear mediation model, and moderation model were used. As a result of the study, it was determined that the image of the teaching profession had a partial mediation role in the relationship between the attitude towards teaching and choosing the teaching profession but did not show the moderation role. According to the results, considering that professional image is a mediator in the relationship between the level of attitude towards the teaching profession and choosing the teaching profession, necessary measures should be taken to increase the level of perception towards the professional image.

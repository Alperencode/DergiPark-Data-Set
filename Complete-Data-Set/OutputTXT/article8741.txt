Makale Başlığı: Possible Effects of Climate Change on Bats
Özet: As one of our era’s most important environmental problems, climate change has negative effects on species, communities, and ecosystems. Bats have a wide distribution throughout Earth and significant roles in several ecosystem processes but they are also among organisms that will be negatively affected by climate change. In this study, possible effects of climate change on bats were revealed by reviewing observational, experimental, and modeling studies conducted in various biomes and geographies worldwide. In those studies, results on distribution, abundance, physiology, phenology, habitats, interactions with other species, foraging activity, and pathogen distribution efficiency of bat species were obtained. Available data suggest that responses of bat populations to climate change are complex, and generalizing is difficult due to species-specific responses. This review shows that our knowledge of the responses of bats to climate change is limited. More research is required on the response of bats to climate change, especially at the species level, in bats with different climatic requirements in different biogeographic regions.

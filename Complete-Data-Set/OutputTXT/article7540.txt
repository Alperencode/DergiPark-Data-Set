Makale Başlığı: The effect of GLONASS on position accuracy in CORS-TR measurements at different baseline distances
Özet: GLONASS system; It has become the second system operating on a global scale after the GPS system in the world, after completing the satellite constellation and using it at full capacity as of 8 December 2011. Due to the increasing need for high accuracy and precision real-time location information, CORS networks have become widespread in the world. In Turkey, it was established as CORS-TR and opened for use in December 2008. Comprehensive studies investigating the effects of Network-Based RTK techniques (VRS, FKP, and MAC) in the CORS-TR network are very limited due to the fact that the GLONASS system has been used at full capacity recently. In this paper, it is aimed to determine the effect of measurements derived from the Network-Based RTK techniques in the CORS-TR network of the GLONASS system on the location accuracy, and thus to make a business plan according to the accuracy and precision requirements of all civil and military users. For this purpose, simultaneous measurements were made with 6 GNSS receiver devices of the same brand and model. A total of 308,908 epoch data (northing value, easting value, and ellipsoidal height: projection coordinates (ITRF96 Datum, 2005.00 Reference Epoch)) were collected at one-second intervals in each technique and for seven days of measurements. As a result of the evaluation and analysis of the data sets obtained with the measurements; It has been observed that the GLONASS system has a positive effect on position accuracy, but in some cases, it also has disruptive effects. It has been observed that the most important contribution is to increase the number of visible satellites and to enable measurements with GLONASS satellites in cases where GPS satellites alone are not sufficient, especially in areas where the satellite elevation angle is narrowed, such as city centers, and forest areas.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Mechanical Properties of St52 and S460MC Steels by Gas Welding
Özet: In this study, the effect of the changes in welding parameters on the tensile strength, which is one of the mechanical properties of the steels, was investigated in the robotic gas arc welding method applied to St52 and S460MC steels, which are widely used in the industry. As a result of the experiments carried out within the scope of the study, it was aimed to determine the optimum parameter values for the MAG welding method. St52 and S460MC materials were used in the experiments. An experimental design was created in order to carry out the experiments in the most accurate way. Parameter val-ues are placed in this created experimental design. As a result of the experiments per-formed according to the created the experimental design, the optimum parameter val-ues were examined, welding processes were applied with the selected values, and the improvements in the welding quality were determined by subjecting the welded samples to the tensile test. The optimum welding parameters providing the best mechanical properties were 25 V, 7 mm/sec and 13 mm/sec for the arc voltage, wire feed speed and welding speed, respectively.

Makale Başlığı: Anti-Islam in Digital Games
Özet: There are approximately 1.2 billion digital game users worldwide. The presentation of Islam in some digital game contents developed for the virtual world poses a problem. In digital games, methods containing secret messages are used, such as subliminal messages and 25th Square Technique. In the study, it was brought to the agenda that digital games create false perceptions in children and adults by using the symbols of the Islamic religion together with terrorism. With this study, it is aimed to reveal the opposition to Islam in digital games, to determine the use of Islam and Muslim perception in digital war games and to make suggestions on this subject. In this research, which is a qualitative study, the messages built into some digital war games were tried to be understood. In the study, answers were sought and suggestions were made for the definition of fear of Islam, the way it is used in digital games, what kind of perception it creates in children and adults who play games, and what should be done.

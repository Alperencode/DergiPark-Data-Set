Özet: This study aims to reveal the awareness and attitudes of undergraduate students attending Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Departments of Nursing, Social Services, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation regarding the testability of health-related content they encounter on social media as a result of needs or daily curiosities. Within the scope of the study, descriptive method and survey technique were used and a questionnaire was applied to 268 students. The differences in social media usage status, awareness levels in inquiry tools, the need for testability of information and the attitude exhibited by students who consider social media as one of the alternative addresses of true information and who are likely to take an active role in the health sector in the future have been put forward. Within the scope of the study, it was found out that the accuracy and reliability of the social media contents are debatable and and the contents in the field of politics and health have negative effects on individuals. It has been suggested that the testability, control, testing criteria and tools of the information on social media platforms should be prepared, the level of awareness should be increased in terms of the negative effects of the content on individuals, and a critical perspective should be developed against the content.

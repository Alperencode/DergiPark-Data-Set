Makale Başlığı: Chaotic Leadership Development Study
Özet: This research aims to develop a measurement tool that reveals teachers’ perceptions on school principals' chaotic leadership behaviors. The population of the research consists of 5088 primary, secondary and high school teachers working in the central districts of Sakarya province in the 2020-2021 academic year. Stratified sampling method was used in the research. A proportional distribution was carried out in the distribution of the teachers in the sample to the layers in terms of the types of schools they work in. In this study, validity and reliability analyzes were performed using data from two study groups. In the validity analysis, exploratory factor analysis was performed with 202 teachers, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed with 251 teachers. As a result, the scale structure consisted of three dimensions and 22 items. The total variance explanation rate of the scale was determined as 58.54%. While the factor load values of the items were between .52 and .95, it was determined that the standard regression loads of the items were higher than .70, and the item averages between the lower (27%) groups and the upper (27%) groups differed significantly. The Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency coefficient was determined as .95. The results of the analyses revealed that the Chaotic Leadership Scale is a valid and reliable scale.

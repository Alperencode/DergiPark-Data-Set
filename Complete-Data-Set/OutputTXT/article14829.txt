Makale Başlığı: On The Gerivan Dialect of Khorasan Turkish
Özet: Oghuz Turkish has different dialects in Iran. One of them is Khorasan Turkish. The dialect in question is important in terms of carrying the linguistic features of both eastern and western Turkish. In the article, the phonetic and morphological features of the Gerivan dialect in North Khorasan are discussed. These features were investigated with a diachronic method. The most important features identified in the said dialect are as follows: ö>e (göz>géz), ü>i (izim "üzüm"), Change the letter /d/ that is between two vowels d>y (geyärdé "giderdi"). Maintaining the consonant /b/ (bérdi "verdi") at the beginning of the word, preserving the consonant /ŋ/ (gäldiŋ"geldin"), making the past participle with the suffix /u/, not using the condition suffix. Some of these traits has emerged because of the variation in the Khorasani Turkish language and some of it has appeared under the influence of Persian . This effect can be seen in both of the sound properties and the sentence structure. For this reason, it can be said that Persian is a serious threat to the Gerivan dialect in terms of the continuity of the Gerivan dialect between generations. The dialect in question is about to fall out of use with the dominant influence of Persian, like other dialects of Khorasan Turkish.

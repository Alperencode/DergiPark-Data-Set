Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INFLATION BY BOOTSTRAP PANEL CAUSALITY TEST
Özet: The agricultural sector is of great importance for the economies of developed and developing countries. Agriculture is a sector that is important both for economic development and for reducing poverty. Considering that the most fundamental problem of underdeveloped and developing countries is the lack of capital accumulation, the agricultural sector is one of the sectors that can provide capital accumulation that can support the development of these group countries. However, the uniquely fragile structure of the agricultural sector can bring along many problems. At the beginning of these problems is price instability specific to agricultural outputs. Therefore, the importance of the agricultural sector in terms of national economies causes governments to produce protective and supportive policies for this sector. In this study, it is aimed to examine the causal relationship between agricultural supports, economic development and inflation using the Bootstrap Panel Causality test developed by Kónya (2006) in line with the data of BRICS+T countries covering the period of 2000-2020. The findings of the study differ between countries. In countries other than China and India, causality relationships were determined between the variables of agricultural support, economic development and inflation.

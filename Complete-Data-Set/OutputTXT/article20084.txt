The aim of this study is to determine the individual inst-rument practice habits of music teacher candidates and to reveal whether individual instrument practice habits make a difference according to the variables of gender, class of education, type of high school graduated, daily individual instrument study time, individual instrument experience and individual instrument success. Relational screening model was used in the research. The sample of the study consisted of 104 students stud-ying in the 1st and 4th grades of Trakya University, Atatürk University, Kastamonu University, Marmara University and Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University Fine Arts Education Department Music Education Department. In order to collect data in the research, a personal information form and the "Individual Instrument Study Habits Scale" developed by Küçükosmanoğlu, Babacan, Babacan and Yüksel were used.

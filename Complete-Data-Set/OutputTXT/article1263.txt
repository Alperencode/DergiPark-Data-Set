Makale Başlığı: Determination of the effects of copper treatment on development period, fecundity, sex ratio and longevity of Bracon hebetor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)
Özet: The impact of the copper treatment on developmental period, fecundity, sex ratio and longevity of Bracon hebetor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was examined under laboratory conditions. Late instar larvae of Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were used as host species. Three different concentrations (50, 100 and 200 mg kg-1) of copper were added to the synthetic diet of host species and parasitoids reared on these hosts were used for the experiments. Treatment with copper prolonged the development period of females at only 200 mg kg-1 concentration, but no significant effect determined for males. Moreover, copper applications did not make any significant change in fecundity, sex ratio and longevity of parasitoids.

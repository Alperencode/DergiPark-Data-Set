Makale Başlığı: Leveraging AI to Study the Impact of COVID-19 on Consumer Online Purchase Behaviour: A Study of Konya
Özet: The paper intends to address the impact of the COVID-19 crisis upon consumer online shopping behaviour, focusing on the factors that affect the decision making towards the choice of e-commerce platform. The study relies on interpreting answers received from the Konya Chamber of Commerce to a questionnaire applied online. The problem of choosing one e-commerce platform over another in terms of convenience, popularity, familiarity, benefits, and transparency is introduced. The study also investigates the main factors that influence different generations’ behaviour towards choosing the online shopping platforms, product items, and respondents’ willingness to support the local (Only from Konya) online retailers. The study implies AI techniques to find and identify the prospective customers most likely to shop from the local suppliers. An AI model has been developed that predicts the customers’ likelihood of preferring regionally local suppliers over the nationwide counterpart. The trained model reported an accuracy of 0.91 on the testing set, which means that given the customer’s data, the model predicts that 91% of the people are willing to buy from a local supplier. This model can be used for targeted advertisement for specific people at a specific time which improve the sales. The study adopts a descriptive research method and aims at describing the attitude of people living in Konya, represented by the members of the Konya Chamber of Commerce.

Özet: In this study, it was aimed to examine the effects of badminton basic training program applied on 11-12 year old children on motor development. Experimental group (EG) mean age was 11.40±.507 years, mean body weight was 38.48±10.10 kg, mean height was 143.26±6.61 cm, Control group (CG) mean age was 11.46± 30 children (13 Female, 17 Male) with a mean body weight of 5.516 years, an average body weight of 34.84±10.05 kg, a mean height of 139.13±6.17 cm and a training age of 2±1.8 years participated voluntarily. Children participating in the study were randomly divided into two groups as control and experimental groups. Different training programs were applied to these two groups. (EG) A 60-minute badminton basic training program was applied for 8 weeks (3 days/week). The control group (CG), on the other hand, only participated in recreational activities without specifying any branch. Pre-test measurements (agility, balance, strength and vertical jump) of both groups were performed before the studies. At the end of 8 weeks, the last test measurements of the groups were taken. Paried Samples T test was used to compare the preliminary and final values of the groups. When the first and last test measurements of the groups were compared between the groups; According to the analysis of the data, a statistically significant difference was observed in the agility test, balance test, strength test and vertical jump test measurement values (p<0.05). As a result; It was observed that the badminton basic training program applied to 11-12 year old children in (EG) was effective on agility, balance, strength and vertical jump performance values (4.785, 2.995, 5.445, -7.651).

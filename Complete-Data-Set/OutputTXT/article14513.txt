Özet: The study aims to reveal a general pattern of postgraduate theses on ethical leadership and ethical codes prepared between 2006-2022 in Turkey. A total of 162 postgraduate theses, 151 of ethical leadership and 11 of ethical codes, are determined as a result of a search conducted with the keywords ethical leadership and ethical codes between January 1, 2022, and February 15, 2022, in the National Thesis Center of the Turkish Higher Education Institution (YÖKTEZ). 162 postgraduate theses, which constitute the universe and sample of the research, are analyzed based on a systematic review within the framework of their types and numbers, the years they are published, the universities they are prepared, their subjects, publication languages, advisor titles, purpose, scope and method parameters. The data obtained from YÖKTEZ are interpreted within the scope of research questions by applying descriptive analysis and content analysis. As a result of the study, it is determined that the greatest number of postgraduate theses were written in 2019. Most of the postgraduate theses are prepared under the advisory of assistant professors. When the postgraduate theses are considered in terms of the language in which they are published, it is understood that they are mostly published in Turkish. When the graduate theses are considered in terms of purpose, scope and method, it is concluded that they are mainly associated with organizational behavior issues in the field of education and management. The research is important in terms of systematic compilation and evaluation, as well as increasing the value of the study in terms of contributing to the national literature.

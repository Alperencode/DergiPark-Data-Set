Makale Başlığı: A Review: Analysis of Metal and Mineral Content in the Complexity of Sidoarjo Hot Mud as a Source of Renewable Energy in Indonesia
Özet: The Sidoarjo Hot Mud is a phenomenon of mudflow caused by exploration activities of PT. Lapindo Brantas since 2006. The purpose of this article is to provide information related to the empowerment of the Sidoarjo Hot Mud which has the potential as alternative source of renewable energy: source of electrical energy and biodiesel catalyst. Based on XRF results on samples at two locations: the center of the eruption and Lusi Island, it showed that there were various metallic elements and oxide minerals. Based on the results, the Sidoarjo Hot Mud from the center of the eruption resulted in potential difference of 8.8 V and electric power of 7.07135 watts/hour (8 circuits). The hot mud samples of Lusi Island produced potential difference of 4.38 V and electric power of 3.5196 watts/hour (3 circuits); 5.84 V and 4.6928 watts/hour (4 circuits). The silica mineral in the center of the eruption was 45.0% (radius 500 m), 45.3% (radius 1000 m), and 43.3% (radius 2000 m), while on Lusi Island it was 43.8%. Based on these results, the Sidoarjo mud has the potential to be used as a source of renewable energy in Indonesia, as a source of electrical energy and for synthesis for biodiesel catalyst.

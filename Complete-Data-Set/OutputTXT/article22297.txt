Makale Başlığı: What is the ideal repair technique for triple hernia accompanied by umbilical and bilateral inguinal hernias?
Özet: Background: For patients with bilateral inguinal hernia (BIH) accompanied by an umbilical hernia (UH), there may be hesitations regarding the repair of all three hernias in the same session in terms of pain and possible problems in the healing process. Studies on these patients are rather rare in the literature. In the present study, the results of laparoscopic and open surgical treatment in patients with triple hernia accompanied by BIH and UH were compared.Methods: The data of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Patients whose hernias were fully repaired with open surgery made up group 1, and patients who underwent laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair together with open UH repair made up group 2. There were 10 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2. The patients’ umbilical defect diameter, whether inguinal hernia (IH) was scrotal or not, applied surgical technique, length of hospital stay, duration of the operation, postoperative complications, and recurrence status were evaluated. Results: While 19 (90.5%) of the patients were male, 2 (9.5%) were female. In group 2, recurrence of unilateral IH was seen in 1 (4.5%) patient. Complications developed in 3 (14.3%) patients: seroma in 1 patient in group 1; and seroma in 1 patient; and wound infection in another patient in group 2. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of duration of the operation, length of hospital stay, or postoperative complications (p value, p=0.251, p=0.756, p=0.538, respectively)Conclusion: In patients with triple hernia where umbilical and BIH occur together, open UH repair and IH repair can be performed safely by TAPP repair.

Makale Başlığı: SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF PERIPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY IN A YOUNG FEMALE PATIENT
Özet: Aims: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rarely seen pregnancy-related myocardial disorder. The diagnosis is usually challenging and is made by exclusion. We aimed to present the recovery of a patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy as a result of a successful treatment plan. Case Report: A 26-year-old female patient with type-2 diabetes mellitus presented to the cardiology department of Trakya University School of Medicine. The patient experienced dyspnea and edema after delivery at 37 weeks of gestation. After the results of the blood tests, further cardiac examinations were deemed necessary. The echocardiogram revealed a low ejection fraction, indicating heart failure. The patient was recommended to halt breastfeeding and bromocriptine treatment was started. The patient was discharged one week later and kept under follow-up. Conclusion: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare disease and therefore not easy to diagnose, but with appropriate treatment plans and frequent follow-ups, patients have high chances of full recovery.

Makale Başlığı: A Software for Ethereum Databases and a Survey for Recommended Applications with ESRI Digital Maps Programming Software
Özet: Ethereum databases with their huge security and integrity can provide perfect mechanism for storing and sharing the data of the highly important projects. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in this paper to design software for Ethereum databases. Also, these methods were used to examine how and how much features can be added to the software. Designing the software considered the barriers and the limitations of Solidity smart contracts programming language and Ethereum blockchain platform. The achieved software can make any Ethereum database with parent-child relationships in between the tables. More professional features will be added in future research as soon as possible. The study used survey method to discuss recommended applications for the software integration with another software for ESRI digital maps programming. The recommended applications are the real estate business full automation and the transparent environmental management to protect the Mediterranean Sea from the pollution. However, most parts related to Ethereum databases software are covered. But to keep this paper in reasonable size, only the survey is included for the parts related to the software recommended applications with the digital maps software.

Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of the Subsistence of the Belgrade and Timisoara Fortresses
Özet: The Belgrade and Timisoara Fortresses are located on the land and waterway opening to Central Europe and Hungary. They became strategically more important for the Ottoman Empire after the territorial losses as a result of the Treaty of Karlowitz because they were the most outposts for the protection of the Ottoman lands in the Balkans and the Danube River. This study determined that the Ottoman Empire purchased a large amount of grain from the towns in Bulgaria, Romania, and the Danube region for the one-year subsistence of the soldiers in the Belgrade and Timisoara Fortresses between 1699 and 1700. This study also focused on determining the prices of the grain supplied, the wages and alimony of the laborers, and the shipping costs of the ships.

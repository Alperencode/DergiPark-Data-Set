Makale Başlığı: Post-COVID-19 vaccine SARS-CoV-2 antibody investigation in healthcare professionals
Özet: Objectives: Main purpose of this study was evaluating inactive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine subsequent anti-S1 IgG feedback and the aspects involved in such reactions for professionals in healthcare (HCP) as the dominant risk group.Methods: Thirty-six HCPs with previous COVID-19 infection and 164 with no priors, 200 in total, who was working in the Ankara Public Health Molecular Diagnosis Laboratory were included. Main tool of identifying humoral immune response quantifably in serum samples which were obtained 28 days after administering each of two doses of vaccine was Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 kit. Results: Average antibody levels of 164 negative HCPs were 15.82 ± 8.59 IU/mL and 26.042 ± 10.73 IU/mL while 36 positive HCPs demonstrated antibody responses as 66.083 ± 33.927 IU/mL and 90 ±  27.012 IU/mL 28 days after each of two doses of vaccine for both individual groups respectively. A statistically meaningful difference was found in antibody levels after two vaccine doses in both groups (p < 0.0001). The authors observed statistically higher average antibody levels after initial vaccine dosage in HCPs with infection than the antibody levels of naive individuals after second dose (p < 0.0001). Age, gender and vaccination feedback did not have a statistically meaningful disparity (p > 0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that the average antibody level achieved after inital dose n HCPs with COVID-19 infection was surpassing the average antibody level obtained after the second dose in naive HCPs. The authors recommend further clinical researches on antibody levels and the extent of protection to prohibit COVID-19

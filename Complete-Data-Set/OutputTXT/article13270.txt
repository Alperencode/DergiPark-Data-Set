Some of the prominent results of the analyzes are as follows: There are 91 writing activities in the 5th grade, 111 in the 6th grade, 64 in the 7th grade and 96 in the 8th grade in Turkish textbooks according to grade levels. Regardless of grade level, mostly “Applies writing strategies” “Writes informative text”; at least "Shares what he wrote", "Writes the steps of a work", "Uses appropriate connections in his writings", "Uses Turkish words taken from foreign languages, not yet settled in Turkish language", "Uses proverbs, idioms and aphorisms to enrich his writings" activities are included.

Makale Başlığı: Little Known about the Relationship between Religion and Society; Analysis of Recep Şentürk's Book New Sociologies of Religion
Özet: One of the main arguments of the author is that nowadays one can no longer talk about a single sociology of religion. Şentürk claims that there are sociologies of religion that operate from very different assumptions today. In addition, the author gives a new dimension to the secularization debate. He believes that instead of the approach that religiosity is constantly increasing or decreasing, it would be more accurate to say that religiosity increases or decreases in certain social segments depending on social events. According to him, religiosity never shows a regular and continuous increase or decrease in all social segments.

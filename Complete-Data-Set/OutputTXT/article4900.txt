Makale Başlığı: Fiscal Dominance in Turkey: ARDL Approach for the Period 1980-2021
Özet: Due to the insufficient tax revenues in the pre-2001 period in Turkey, the public deficits could not be met, and for this reason, Central Bank resources were heavily used. This situation both caused the problem of inflation and prevented the effective use of monetary policy. Although the short-term advance application was intended to be abolished from time to time until 2001 due to its negative effects, the lack of sufficient tax revenues has led to the fact that this application remains the most important source of financing. due to the transformation in the economy after the 2001 crisis, the practice of short-term advances has been discontinued in order to reduce financial dominance. However, public deficits did notdecrease at the expected level until 2005 and the Central Bank was prevented from acting independently. after 2005, the financial dominance beganto decrease gradually. In the study, short-term and long-term analysis was carried out with ARDL method to examine the financial dominance relationship for the period of 1980-2021 in Turkey. Inflation was used as the dependent variable. Large money supply, public deficit, treasury bills and GDP were used as independent variables. According to the results of the analysis, 1% increase in the large money supply, public deficit and GDP increases inflation. A 1% increase in treasury bills, which may occur, reduces inflation, albeit very slightly. In the short term, 1% increase in the large money supply, public deficit and treasury bills reduces inflation.

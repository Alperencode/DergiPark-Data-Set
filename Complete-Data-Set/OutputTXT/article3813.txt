Makale Başlığı: FROM ANATOLIAN WORD HATTİCE TABARNA TO İL-TEBER IN ANCIENT TURKIC PEOPLES
Özet: In the cuneiform texts from Kayseri-Kültepe, is seen that Hattian t/labarna, an Anatolian word, has been used with special names since the 1800 BC. Later, in the Old Hittite Age, the name Labarna / Tabarna continued as the tradition of naming the king (Labarna I, Hattušili I (= Labarna II)). labarna-/tabarna- as the title of the Hittite kings, was used to mean king, ruler. It is clear that the first syllable of t/labarna, which we think is derived from the Sumerian word TAB (double, double, double, two-part), has a double, dual meaning. The title Tabarna/Labarna was used only for the "great king of the Hatti country", and the emblem used for the Hittite kingdom is the ax, which is also the symbol of power. During the KI.LAM (market place) festival, it sometimes appears that the iron ax and the iron spear, as the symbol of the kingdom, are mentioned with the king as the symbol of the kingdom. Thus, it becomes evident that the ax and spear refer to "symbols of the kingdom". In the region extending as far as Southern Europe, the Middle East and India, two axes or double axes with a single handle appear as the known weapon and symbol of the powers. In ancient times, it seems that the labrys (double-mouthed axe) was used in religious ceremonies or presented to the gods as a votive stuff. Among the old Turkish titles before Islam, the title of İl-teber (administrator of the province / ruler of the province) appeared in the inscriptions as the title of the Uyghur and Karluk chiefs. All these are very important in terms of indicating the historical journey of the Hattic t/labarna "ruler title" from the Hittites to İl-teber in the ancient Turkic Peoples.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Bread Wheat Genotypes in terms of Yield and Yield Components in Muş Conditions
Özet: Since the winter conditions are very harsh in Muş, winter bread wheat is grown in general. The study was set up in Muş province in the 2020-2021 growing season, under rainfall conditions. The trial was carried out with 15 bread wheat genotypes in a Random Blocks Experimental Design with 3 replications. As a result of the analysis carried out to determine the relationship between yield components and grain yield, it was observed that there were significant differences at the p<0.01 level between genotypes in all investigated characteristics. In the study; G1, G2, G3, G5, Hanlı and Yıldırım genotypes were determined to have high adaptation and grain yield potential in Muş conditions. In particular, the G3 advanced stage line has the highest grain yield and has come to the fore with almost all its features. According to the correlation analysis, it was understood that all yield components were significantly and positively related to grain yield. In this case, it may be suggested to consider yield components for selection in early generations of wheat in breeding programs. In Muş conditions, it is important to conduct new studies since there are limited studies on bread wheat.

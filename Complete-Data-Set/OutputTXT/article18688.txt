Makale Başlığı: Cross-interactions between Norepinephrine, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Human Osteoblast Cells in Culture Conditions
Özet: Objective: The role of norepinephrine (NE) on growth, adhesion and invasion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATTC 43300  was  examined  in  human  osteoblast  (HOB)  cells.  The  effects  of  NE  and/or  MRSA  on  the  viability  and  cell  death  pathways  of  HOB  cells were also investigated. Furthermore, the alterations of bacterial response to oxidative stress (H2O2) were analyzed in the presence/absence of NE. Materials and Methods: Bacterial growth was detected spectrophotometrically. The colony counting method was examined for adhesion-invasion.  The  alteration  of  HOB  cell  viability  was  determined  by  methyl  thiazolyl  diphenyl-tetrazolium  bromide  (MTT)  assay.  The  death  pathways  of  HOB  cells  were  examined  microscopically  using  acridine  orange-ethidium  bromide  dual  staining  and  dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCF-DA) dye. The bacterial response to H2O2 was investigated by agar dilution.Results: The growth of bacterium was not affected in the presence of NE. Bacterial adhesion was decreased by NE (p<0.0001) while high-level NE induced invasion (p=0.013). HOB cell viability was reduced by MRSA and/or NE (p<0.001). MRSA and co-existence of MRSA and NE caused necrosis more than apoptosis in HOB cells (p<0.05). NE did not alter the bacterial response to oxidative stress. Conclusion: Norepinephrine has different effects on the biological properties of both MRSA and HOB cells.

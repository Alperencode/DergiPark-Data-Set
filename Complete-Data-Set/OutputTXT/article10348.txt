Makale Başlığı: Beliefs and Practices Formed Around Birth in the Context of “Ritual Pollution and Purification Understanding” in Religions
Özet: Ritual pollution expressing the aspect of spiritual, religious or legal pollution, and purification practices towards getting rid of this situation exists in every society and shows great diversity. In fact; in some societies, almost the entire moment of life is surrounded by these ritual purifications. On the other hand; while religions differ on what exactly constitutes ritual pollution and which ritual precautions can bring back the purity, most ritual purification, as an observable reality, is shaped around transitional periods such as birth, marriage and death. As a matter of fact, cultures have assumed that supernatural forces controlling their destiny are effective in these critical periods of human life, and there is a transition from the cosmic order to “chaos” or from the inhabited world to another “unknown world” as the natural order is disrupted as a result of disturbing these forces. Where the forms of social status change, seen as a crisis of life, ritual pollution also occurs, and this situation makes ritual purification compulsory. In parallel with this understanding, the birth event, which is the first step of the transition periods, has been seen as a common cause of “ritual pollution” from the most archetypal religion to today's universal religions, and the idea of “ritual purification”, which  becomes the current issue after birth, has revealed a similar purification process for the mother and her baby. This process of “removal from society for a certain period of time”, “purification by means of water, fire and soil” are completed by “re-admission to society after purification from ritual pollution”. In this study, which aims to examine the rituals of purification formed around birth in religions by using the phenomenological method, it has been tried to reveal the various forms and symbolism of the rituals without detaching them from their historical context.

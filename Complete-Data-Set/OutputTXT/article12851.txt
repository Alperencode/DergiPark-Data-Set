Makale Başlığı: The Administrative Structure of the Cebel-i Bereket Sanjak from its Establishment to its Dissolution [1879-1933]
Özet: Sanjaks come after the provinces in terms of importance in the Ottoman administrative structure. The name Cebel-i Bereket was given to the Gavur Mountains (Amanos) during the Tanzimat Period. It emerged with the expansion of the administrative borders of the sanjak known as Üzeyr and Payas and changing its center. When Sancak was founded in 1879, Payas and Osmaniye were connected here. The districts of Hassa, İslahiye and Bahçe, which were also affiliated to Maraş, were taken from Maraş and included in the Cebel-i Bereket Sanjak. Its administrative center was Yarpuz Town, which was in the middle of the Gavur Mountains for security reasons. When Yarpuz could not show the desired development, the center of the sanjak was moved to Erzin in 1906 and to Osmaniye in 1909, taking into account the security threats from the Armenians. There were some objections to these relocations by the local people and notables. Ümraniye (Dörtyol) and Ayas districts emerged within the sanjak. Over time, the names of some towns and districts were changed. After the proclamation of the Republic, Ceyhan District was included in the borders of the sanjak, which became a province. During this period, Hassa lost its status as a district and became a sub-district of İslahiye. Cebel-i Bereket Province was abolished in 1933. The districts of Dörtyol, Ceyhan, Osmaniye and Bahçe were connected to Adana (Seyhan) Province and İslahiye to Gaziantep.

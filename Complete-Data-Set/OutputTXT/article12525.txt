Makale Başlığı: The Impact of Using Creative Drama Techniques on the 8th Graders’ English Reading Skills Achievement
Özet: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of using creative drama techniques on the success of 8th graders in improving their English reading skills. The research was carried out with 40 students studying in the 8th grade. 20 of them are in the experimental group and 20 of them are in the control group. The applications were made with the dialogues found in the 8th grade Upswing English book. Dialogues with the control group in the book were examined within the framework of the activities included in the current training program. On the other hand, the same dialogues in the experimental group were continued by applying creative drama techniques. The intervention took place over a period of 14 weeks. The same achievement test was applied to both groups in the 1st week and the 14th week. The quantitative research method was used in the data collection analysis of the research. Based on the fact that creative drama techniques contribute to the development of reading skills in foreign language teaching and indirectly to vocabulary and grammar teaching, creative drama has been regarded and used as an alternative teaching method.

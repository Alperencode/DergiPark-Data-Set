Makale Başlığı: Seeking for a Spelling in Arabic Letter Texts Written in Turkish: The Use of Double Vowel Point
Özet: The alphabets used for the transfer of sound to writing are structures that have a systematic order accepted as a result of long efforts. Although alphabets undergo some changes during their development process, in parallel with the prevalence of use, they become dull, unchangeable structures. Various problems may arise if the alphabet of a nation is adopted by different nations. The first of these is the issue of whether nations adopting the alphabet of a different civilization can translate their own voices into writing. The Arabic alphabet, which has been used for the longest time among the Turks, is often criticized for not being able to translate the sounds of Turkish into writing. However, the stereotyped orthography tradition created in the process with the use of the Arabic alphabet does not reflect the pronunciation of the period. For this reason, from time to time, we witness the attempts of the authors and copyists to go beyond the stereotyped orthographic traditions in the texts with Arabic letters. In our opinion, marking the same letter with a double vowel point is one of these attempts. In this article, it has been tried to draw attention to the use of double vowel point in texts written in Turkish with Arabic letters.

Makale Başlığı: FROM CUNEIFORM TEXTS TO ANCIENT WRITERS: BEROSSOS
Özet: While ancient historians create their works, they make citations to the narrative of previous authors and they did text quotes. These quotations were meant to enrich both the author's work and to provide wider information about the previous nations. Ancient writers used the narrations of the authors of these societies while giving information about the history of distant nations, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia. Many ancient historians have benefited from the nonextant work of Berossos for the history of Mesopotamia and mythological narratives known to have gone back thousands of years. These authors included the work of the Berossos, especially the king's lists, the Flood myth and the descriptions of the Oannes, adding their own interpretations. This situation has led the Greek community to arrive in the Hellenic world with the historical thought system of Mesopotamia and the tradition of mythological expression.  While some of this information has been adopted with great appreciation by the Hellenic community, some of its credibility has been skeptical. The main reason for this situation can be claimed to be the cultural difference between the two communities. This study aims to reveal the effects of Mesopotamian wisdom on the Hellenic thought style by explaining how the narratives of the Hellenic community were found in the works of the historians of the era through the work of Berossos.

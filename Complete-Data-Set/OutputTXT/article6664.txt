Makale Başlığı: Activities of the 16th Division  during the Evacuation of the Çanakkale Front as per War Diaries
Özet: The Battle of Çanakkale commenced on February 19, 1915, and concluded on January 9, 1916. This period can be scrutinized by dividing it into two parts, i.e., naval battles and land battles. The former covers February 19, 1915 - March 18, 1915, while the latter covers April 25, 1915 - January 9, 1916. The evacuation of the battlefield was conducted in two phases by the Allies. Arıburnu and Anafarta area was evacuated on December 20, 1915, while Seddülbahir on January 9, 1916. These evacuations marked the end of the Çanakkale Battles. Founded in the Adana-Mersin district, the 16th Division was first sent to Istanbul and then to the Çanakkale Front after the declaration of mobilization. The division was positioned near the left flank of the front, especially Kanlısırt in the area of Arıburnu, until the end of the battles. Moreover, the division participated in major battles and military missions on the Çanakkale Front. Their last participation is in the evacuation of the front. The evacuation emerged as a compulsory action for the Allies because of many factors, such as endless and inconclusive trench warfare, the involvement of Bulgaria in the Great War, the functionalization of the Berlin Road, and the forthcoming winter conditions. This study aims to analyse the 16th Division’s role during the evacuation of the Çanakkale Front. Therefore, the basis for the study is constituted of war diaries of the division, and November-January 1916 period is examined. In addition, the study attempts to offer an answer to the long-debated discussions as per military documents on whether the Turkish side was aware of the evacuation and could interfere with it or not.

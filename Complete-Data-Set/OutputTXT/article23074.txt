Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF CHILD-TO-CHILD TEACHING APPROACH ON STUDENTS’ LEVEL OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN SOCIAL STUDIES
Özet: This study aims to investigate the effects of the child-to-child teaching approach on students’ level of social responsibility in primary social studies courses. A mixed-method experimental intervention approach was adopted in this research. The study participants were 5th-grade students, students' parents, and a social studies teacher. The social responsibility scale, semi structured interviews, unstructured observation, control list, video records, student products, anecdotes, and researcher's diary were used as data collection tools. The results revealed that the child-to-child teaching approach (CtC) applied in social studies courses statistically impacted students' social responsibility levels. Moreover, it was determined that the CtC contributed to the students' social responsibility development according to the students', parents', and social studies teacher's views. It was also determined that participants had positive views regarding the CtC, and they thought that the approach was useful and enjoyable.

Makale Başlığı: Characterization of Durum Wheat Landraces Which Collected in Mardin Province
Özet: This research was carried out in Tilkitepe village of Artuklu district of Mardin province in the 2019-2020 growing season to determine the characterization of local durum wheat populations collected from the borders of Mardin province. In the study, together with Güneyyıldızı, Hasanbey, Zühre and Burgos varieties, 27 local durum wheat populations collected from the districts of Mardin province were used. According to the variance analysis results of the data obtained from the characteristics examined in the study; While 0.1% and 0.5% significant differences were detected between genotypes in terms of many characteristics, no significant difference could be detected between genotypes in terms of the number of ears per square meter, protein ratio, wet gluten ratio in grain, and starch ratio. In the results of working; number of spikes per square meter, 190-361 heads, duration of spike 93-124 days, plant height 93-152 cm, spike length 5.6-8.8 cm, number of spikes per spike 13.8-20.4 pieces/spike, number of grains per spike 13.8-76.1, spike yield 0.34 -2.94 g/spike, grain yield 1750-6169 kg/ha, thousand grain weight 31.4-45.2 g, vitreous content 72.8-97.0%, protein rate 11.4%-14.8%, for wet gluten content in grain 22.2-30.1%, ash content in grain 1.50-2.09% for starch, 66.4-69.7 ml for starch, and 70-90% for lodging ratio. According to the research results and Biplot graphs, it has been determined that there is high variation among local populations. As a result, this variation detected in local populations will contribute to the increase of genetic diversity, enrichment of the gene pool and the development of native varieties by using it as a parent in future breeding studies.

Makale Başlığı: Effect of Brassinosteroid Applications on Flower Sex Distribution of 'Chandler' Walnut Cultivar
Özet: In this study, the effects of brassinosteroid (BR) group compounds, 24-epibrassinolide (EBr) and 22(S), 23(S)-homobrassinolide (HBr), on flower sex distribution were studied. The study was carried out on the 'Chandler' walnut (Juglans regia L.) cultivar between 2016-2018 at the Department of Horticulture Faculty of Agriculture, Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University. 'Chandler' grafted on a seedling rootstock were planted into 70-liter pots containing soil: peat: perlite (2:1:1) medium. HBr and EBr were applied twice at a concentration of 1 mg L-1 for two consecutive years in the dormant season and at bud burst, using a hand sprayer. The results show that BR applications could alter the flower sex distribution in walnuts. EBr and HBr applications significantly increased the number of females, catkin (male), and total flowers per plant. The highest number of female flowers (5.2) was observed in the plant treated with HBr. It was determined that the annual growth of the plant and the increase in the numbers of the female flower, catkin, and total flowers were statistically positively related. It is seen that the proportional relationship between male and female flowers is independent of BR applications and the growth of the plant.

Makale Başlığı: Culturable Bacterial Communities Related to Different Larval Stages of Sanys irrosea (Guenee, 1852) (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidae)
Özet: Many bacterial species are frequently associated with insects in symbiotic, mutualistic, or parasitic rela-tionships. Symbiotic bacteria living in mostly insect gut have many roles in insect’s biology such as nutrition, devel-opment, sex determination and evolution. Therefore, studying of symbiotic bacteria in insects is very important to elucidate their roles in their hosts biology. In this study, we purposed to isolate and identify the culturable bacterial species in internal organs (mostly gut parts) of Sanys irrosea (Guenee, 1852) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) which was selected as model organism. The bacterial flora of different development stages of S. irrosea was studied by culture dependent techniques and the isolated bacteria was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 22 bacterial isolates were obtained from different instar larvae of the insect and were identified. Among the identified bacterial species, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Bacillus species were dominant. In addition, some potential slug, human and plant pathogenic bacteria (Moraxella osloensis, Kocuria rosea and Clavibacter michi-ganensis) were isolated. The results were discussed with respect to the bacterial composition of S. irrosea regarding effects of bacterial diversity on the larval development of the insect. Results obtained from this study should be beneficial for future studies to understand roles of bacteria in the larval development of Lepidopteran insects.

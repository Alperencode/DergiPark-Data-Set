Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Factors Affecting the Latency Period and Type of Birth in Patients with Preterm Prematur Rupture of Membranes
Özet: ABSTRACTBackground and Purpose: To determine the factors associated with the latent period in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).Methods: 53 patients who applied to our clinic within 1 year and were diagnosed with PPROM and met the inclusion criteria participated in this prospective cross-sectional study. Factors thought to affect the latent period in these patients were examined in terms of delivery time and mode.Results: Latent period; was negatively correlated with dilatation and positively correlated with collum length. The mean latent time of patients with contraction was statistically significantly lower than those without.In another model, gestational week, collum length and birth weight were found to be the most significant factors associated with the latent period.In the latent period groups; Statistically, a significant difference was found in the mean dilatation and collum length.The contraction rate was higher in those with a latency period of 2 days or less.Conclusion: Latent duration is inversely proportional to dilatation and directly proportional to collum length. Uterine contraction is higher in patients with a latency period of fewer than 2 days. Other statistically significant factors related to the latent period are the gestational week and the fetal weight.

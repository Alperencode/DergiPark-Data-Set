Makale Başlığı: FOCAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA TREATED WITH CRYOSURGERY: A CASE REPORT
Özet: Focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH) is a rare, benign disease of the oral mucosa, which is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 13 and 32 with probable genetic susceptibility. In this case report, we present the clinical, histopathological features and treatment of lesions observed in the oral mucosa of a 16-year-old female patient. Although FEH does not require any treatment in most cases, various treatments are available for patients with aesthetic concerns or complaints of functional impairment due to constant biting on the lesions. Cryosurgery was preferred for this patient with multiple lesions varying in size from 0.2 to 1.5 cm because of its many advantages, and considerable improvement was observed in the lesions.

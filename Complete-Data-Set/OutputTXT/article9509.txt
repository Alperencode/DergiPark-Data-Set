Makale Başlığı: Archaeometric Investigation of the Seasonal Mosaic of Antiochia
Özet: The Seasons Mosaic exhibited in Hatay Archaeology Museum consists of nine panels and the seasons are depicted in its four corners. The colors of the glass and stone tesserae on the Seasons Mosaic were determined by the digital Focus brand Capsure Portable Color Matching device based on the Munsell Color Catalogue. The petrographic analyzes of the stone tesserae were characterized archeometrically by thin-section optical microscopy analysis and the chemical analysis of the glass tesserae using the Polarized Energy Distributed X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer. In the light of the results obtained, the rock type, texture, hardness level, rocks and minerals forming the aggregate of the stone tesserae were defined. The chemical composition of the elements found within the framework of the results of the glass tessera analysis was determined and predictions were made about the color properties. By petrographic analysis of stone tesserae, rock types were determined as biosparitic, biomicritic and micritic limestone. As a result of the PED-XRF analysis of the glass tesserae, it was determined that it was soda lime glass, that plant ash was not used, and that it had low deterioration and resistance. It has been understood that the element that gives the green color to the glass tesserae is copper. By looking at the strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) contents, it was concluded that terrestrial raw materials were used in the structure of glass tesserae.

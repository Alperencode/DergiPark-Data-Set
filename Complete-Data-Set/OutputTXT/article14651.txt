Makale Başlığı: Effects of Row Spacing and Sowing Rate on Quality Performance of Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) Under Tokat Ecological Conditions
Özet: This research was conducted to determine the effects of row spacing and sowing rate on the hay quality characteristics of alfalfa under Tokat-Kazova ecological conditions during the years of 2014-2016. Alfalfa cultivar Bilensoy-80 was sown at four different row spacings (15, 30, 45 and 60 cm) and six different sowing rates (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 kg ha-1). The experimental design was randomized complete block design in split plots with four replications. Row spacings were main plots and sowing rates were sub-plots. The highest crude protein content (% 20.8) and relative feed value (147.8) were obtained from 5 kg ha-1 sowing rate and 15 cm row spacing. It was concluded based on present findings that Belinsoy-80 alfalfa cultivar should be sown at 15 cm row spacing and 25 kg ha-1sowing rate for high hay quality under Tokat-Kazova ecological conditions.

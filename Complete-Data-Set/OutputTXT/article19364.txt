Makale Başlığı: Measurement-evaluation applications of context-based activities in hybrid learning environments
Özet: Students may be at a disadvantage when learning if they cannot follow lessons face to face due to such reasons as epidemics, disasters, transportation, or family. The main purpose of this study is to perform alternative measurement and evaluation practices in hybrid learning environments in a way that will make students in online physics lessons active participants in the process. The research uses the developmental, emancipatory, and critical action research models within the scope of the qualitative research method. The research was carried out over three weeks under the guidance of the researcher with 32 10th-graders at the school where the researcher taught physics for 12 years. Semi-structured interview forms, rubric forms, and documents were used as data collection tools. The interviews and documents were evaluated using content analysis, while the rubrics were evaluated using descriptive analysis. The students’ active and decisive roles during the assessment and evaluation activities within the context-based learning activities regarding physics subjects as well as at the end of learning encouraged the students attending the lesson online and those attending in person to learn under the same conditions. In this context, activities in which students are a part of the learning and measurement-evaluation processes should be encouraged in online and hybrid-learning environments. Developing context-based activities with regard to experiments, analogy, and theoretical applications and developing qualified practices in which students will be active throughout the process under the guidance of action researchers will be beneficial for ensuring this.

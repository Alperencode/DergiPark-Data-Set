Makale Başlığı: THE EVALUATION OF BALKAN GIPSY STORIES WITHIN GIPSY STORIES BY TAHIR ALANGU IN TERMS OF PLOT
Özet: In this study, by looking at how gypsies are handled in the plot in 7 stories that are selected from Tahir Alangu's work Gypsy Stories, determinations were made about both their lifestyles and their stance in society. In our study, general information about the appearance of the story genre and the gypsies who are the subject of the stories were given, and then the plot part of the stories was excamined. This study aims to determine the prefered of the gypsies, who are generally described as colorful, funny, and unique but sometimes risky, in the selected stories. In this context, the images of the gypsies in terms of socio-cultural stance and economic aspects were revealed by looking at the roles of the gypsies in the plot of the stories. This community, which creates a living space for themselves in almost every part of the world, has been described as a disadvantageous group by society due to the negativenarratives about them. It's seen in these stories that the gypsies remain between opposite poles and situations such as good-bad, right-wrong, rich-poor. Gypsies, who are described as positive and negative due to their physical characteristics and lifestyle, appeared in these forms in the stories we examined. In stories with multi-chain plots, in addition to similar events, events that occurred independently from each other were also discussed.

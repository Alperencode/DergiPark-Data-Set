Makale Başlığı: A Study on the Examination of Electronic Health Literacy
Özet: This research was carried out in order to determine the e-health literacy levels of students training at the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences of the state university and to determine the individual characteristics that can make a difference at this level. The universe of the research comprises of all students studying at the Yozgat Bozok University Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences of the State University in the 2020-2021 academic year. There are 1304 students that are enrolled in this faculty and 920 students continue their education actively. In the study, 499 complete surveys were returned. Thus, the population representation ratio of the sample was 54%. In this study, the "e-HEALS: The e-Health Literacy Scale", developed by Norman and Skinner and whose Turkish validity-reliability study was conducted by Coşkun and Bebiş, was used in data collection. The average e-health level of the participants was determined to be 3,47 (±0,66). According to the analysis results, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of age, gender, class and education time (p>0,05). In the analysis, there was significant difference in the variables of education department, computer use skill, internet use skill and Internet access (p<0,05). Consequently, it is suggested to increase the level of e-health by providing educations for participants on how to access health-related news on the Internet, and from which sites and sources they can obtain safe and certain information.

Makale Başlığı: Effect of Potassium Sulphate Fertilizer Doses on Sugarcane Growth Yield and Quality Grown in Sudan
Özet: Sugarcane is one of the most important crops in Sudan which played a leading role in the local and foreign trade. Research has been conducted in two sites in Sugarcane Research Center Farm in Guneid-Sudan from 5/7/2019 to 5/9/2020. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of potassium sulphate fertilizer doses on the growth, yield, and quality of sugarcane. The variety tested was Co 6806. The treatments consist of five doses of potassium sulphate (SOP) fertilizer which contains (50% K2O and 18% S); K1: 0.0, K2: 40, K3: 80, K4: 120, and K5: 160 kg SOP kg ha-1 arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) replicated three times. The results obtained showed that there was a significant effect on plant growth due to the application of different levels of potassium sulphate fertilizer in the two sites. Statistically, the treatment K3: (80 SOP kg ha-1) significantly recorded the highest cane and sugar yield values compared to the other potassium sulphate levels and the control in the two different experimental sites.

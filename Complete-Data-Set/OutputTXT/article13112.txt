Makale Başlığı: The Investigation of Flow Characteristics in Nanofluids Under Magnetic Field
Özet: The existence/application of an externally induced magnetic field, like in satellite cooling applications, causes a decrement in heat transfer when used with nanofluids. This study investigates the flow characteristics and velocity profile of distilled water, alumina nanofluid, and cobalt ferrite ferrofluid in a horizontal cylindrical heat pipe flowing in a laminar regime and being exposed to an external magnetic field. All of the simulations were performed with ANSYS Fluent MHD module, for a concentration of 2%, Reynolds number of 10, and Hartmann numbers of 25, 50, and 150. The velocity profiles, pressure drops, and flow characteristics are examined by varying the magnetic field intensity while keeping all other parameters constant. It is concluded that an external magnetic field causes a deterioration in the velocity profiles of the nanofluid, especially in cobalt ferrite, while it does not have a significant effect on water. When the magnitude of the magnetic field is increased by 2 times, it is seen that the velocity of the fluid decreases by 6% and increasing the magnetic field from 0 to 50 Tesla causes a deceleration rate of 9%, which leads to the conclusion that application of a magnetic field for the first time has a more significant slowing effect when comparing it to increasing the magnetic field. In addition, when a magnetic field of 50 Tesla is considered, the maximum velocity of alumina is lower than that of water by 5.10%, and the maximum velocity of cobalt ferrite is lower by 28.57%.

Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF THE BUWAYHIDS CHAPTER OF ṬABAḲĀT-I NAṢIRĪ
Özet: The Buwayhids, ruled from the southern shores of the Caspian to Kirman, from Al Jazeera to Oman, in the 10th and 11th centuries, did not get the attention they deserved among contemporary historians. Although there are various reasons for this situation, the scarcity of references on the Buwayhids history makes historians’ writing on this subject important for us inevitably. Cûzcânî is also one of the historians who provide relevant information about the subject. Although the information about the Buwayhids is mainly summary in the work of Ṭabaḳāt-ı Naṣırī by Cûzcânî, one of the 13th-century historians, most of this information requires confirmation. The historian, who examines the historical events related to the Buwayhids under seven titles in total, sometimes confuses the names and sometimes uses explicitly wrong expressions about the events. In this study, the information conveyed in Ṭabaḳāt-ı Naṣırī was evaluated by comparing them with the quotations and comments made from the main sources of Buwayhids. In this way, inferences were made about the subject.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Sensation Seeking on Flow State in Ski and Snowboard: Moderator Role of Gender
Özet: Various models and theories based on psychology have been developed. Flow Theory, which is among these models, has been studied by many researchers. In this context, the moderating role of gender in the effect of sensation-seeking on the flow of skiers and snowboarders was investigated. The research was carried out on 622 participants who ski and snowboard in winter tourism regions in Turkey. The Contextual Sensation Seeking Questionnaire for Skiing and Snowboarding-CSSQ-S and The Dispositional Flow Scale Sort Form (DFS-2) measurement tools were used in the research. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that there is a causal relationship between CSSQ-S (Novelty) and DFS-2. As a result of the regulatory impact analysis, it was determined that there were significant differences in terms of women and men in the relationship between CSSQ-S (Novelty) and DFS-2. As a result, it was determined that there is a causal relationship between CSSQ-S (Novelty) and DFS-2. According to this result, the effect of women's pursuit of excitement about skiing and snowboarding on the flow state is higher than that of men, which puts women in a more intense flow state during the experience.

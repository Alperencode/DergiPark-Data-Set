Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Inflation and Economic Growth in EU Countries
Özet: Low inflation and high economic growth are two of the mainmacroeconomic targets that all countries hope to reach. The reciprocalrelationship between inflation and growth is currently an importantdebate in the literature. Although early studies generally focused onthe view that inflation had no effect on growth or that it had a positiveeffect on growth, the upward trend of inflation in many countries in the1970s and 1980s led to a change in direction in the inflation-growthdebate. This discussion shows that the way inflation affects growth isdirectly related to its level. Therefore, if a certain inflation threshold valueis exceeded, the view that inflation will affect growth negatively comes tothe fore. In addition, the effect of economic growth on inflation is anotherdimension of the inflation-growth debate. In this context, it is importantto examine the inflation growth spiral in the context of causality. In thisstudy, the relationship between inflation and growth was investigatedbetween the years 1996 and 2019 in 27 EU countries using Dumitrescuand Hurlin (2012) causality approach. In the analysis, two variables wereused as an indicator of inflation. These are consumer prices Index (CPI)and GDP deflator. The results show that there is a bidirectional causalityrelationship from inflation to growth and from growth to inflation forboth inflation indicators.

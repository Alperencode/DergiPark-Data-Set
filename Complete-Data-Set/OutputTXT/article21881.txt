Makale Başlığı: Teachers as Researchers: Their Research Competencies Obstacles Conceptions and Expected Research Benefit
Özet: Research competency is a common qualification for all professional occupations. Research competence has long been regarded as one of the core qualifications of the teaching profession. Within this context, the main purpose of the study is to examine teachers' research competencies, their benefits from research, research obstacles and their research conceptions. The sample of the study, which is a quantitative research designed in survey model, consists of 214 high school teachers. The data of the study were obtained through the administration of the scale developed by the researchers to the sample group in the 2018-2019 Spring semester. The main results of the study are as follows: (1) Nearly half of the teachers have conducted research in the last three years in order to improve their teaching processes, classroom practices and solve the problems they encountered. (2) Teachers' research competencies and barriers are moderate. (3) Teachers find that teacher research is highly beneficial for themselves and their students. (4) While teachers characterize research done with conventional notions for producing academic publications more precisely as research, they do not seem confident that research on school and classroom problems is research. Considering these results can contribute to the development of policies for educating teachers as researchers during their pre-service and in-service education.

Makale Başlığı: Relations of the Safavid State with Turko-Islamic Sultanates in India
Özet: The Safavid State, which constitutes one of the glorious pages of the history of the Turco-Islamic states, besides playing an important role in international relations, military and political life not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the history of the Near and Middle East states, it has also played an active role in relationship between Europe and East. One of the regions that the Safavid State gave particular importance to in its foreign relations was the Turco-Islamic sultanates in India's Deccan plateau. At the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century, there were Adil Shahis (1490-1686), Nizam Shahis (1491-1633) and Qutub Shahis (1512-1687) states in Deccan. The relations of the Safavids with these three Turcic sultanates initiated thanks to the achievements of Shah Ismail, following the establishment of the Safavid state. Considering the military superiority of the Mughal Empire (1526-1857) established in India right after the Safavid state, it was only a matter of time before these three small Sultanates joined the empire. However, they chose to oppose the Mughal Empire and declared the Ithnā'ashari Islam the official state religion and accepted the sovereignty of the Safavid Shahs for a long time. Especially, during the reign of the Safavid shahs Shah Tahmasp I (1524-1576) and Shah Abbas I (1587-1629), relations established between the Safavid-Deccan Turco-Islamic sultanates were at a high level. These three Turcic sultanates, which are also referred to as the "Shiite Sultanates" in many sources, were able to maintain their relations with the Safavids, even under difficult conditions, until their occupation by the Mughal Empire.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the compatibility between corrosion casts and 3D reconstruction of pig head arterial system on cone beam computed tomography
Özet: This study aimed to compare the corrosion cast models of the porcine head arterial system with three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of these cast models. Six heads from sows were simultaneously injected through both carotid arteries with Duracryl Plus for corrosion cast technique and an additional head, also from another one sow head, was filled with saturated lead tetroxide (Pb3O4) in a 10% hot water solution (40°C) of gelatin for CBCT study. Two-dimensional (2D) images were stored in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). Subsequently, segmentation and post-processing of these images were performed by using various software programs. The 3D models were found to be compatible with the corrosion cast models. It was observed that osseous structures and arteries were clearly identified on CBCT images. Specimen scan, segmentation, and post segmentation had a duration of 10-15 minutes, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, respectively. The internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, and its main branches were seen well on 3D models. In conclusion, it is considered that 3D models and images can be effectively used in anatomy education, radiological evaluations, pathological and variational investigations.

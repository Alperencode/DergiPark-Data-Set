Makale Başlığı: Protest Method of Ottoman Gendarmerie Who Couldn't Get Salary: Abandonment of Weapons
Özet: The wages of the gendarmerie units, which had an important place in the Ottoman security organization, despite the wide range of duties and powers determined by the laws, started to be low due to the inflationary economy, especially since the 19th century. In addition to the current situation, there were disruptions and delays in the salaries and allowance of the gendarmerie soldiers as a result of the economic depression brought by this century. These delays sometimes lasted as long as two years and this situation was met with the reaction of the gendarmes.. While the reactions were sometimes manifested in the form of written complaints to the commanders and local administrators, when the complaints remained unresolved, the gendarmerie took the task to the next step and implemented practices such as "abandonment of duty" and "abandonment of weapons" and did not perform their duties until they received their salaries. In this study, the abandonment of weapons practices developed by the gendarmerie soldiers as a protest method against the delay in their salaries will be included. In addition, in the face of this problem, the efforts of Sublime Porte to solve the problem in the presence of ministries and local administrators will be followed through archival documents and the state's reflexive attitude against possible dangers as a result of the turmoil environment and the abandonment of arms application that will spread to other units will be evaluated. In addition, the treatment and punishments given to the soldiers who carried out abandonment of weapons will also be examined in this study.

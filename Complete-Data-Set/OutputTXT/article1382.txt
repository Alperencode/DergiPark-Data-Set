Makale Başlığı: Hypothermia: what are the trends in recent studies? – a bibliometric analysis with global productivity
Özet: Aim: Although the number of global studies on hypothermia, which plays an important role in morbidity and mortality in adults and newborns, has increased, there is still no bibliometric research on this subject in the literature. This study, it was aimed to determine trend topics and global productivity by using various statistical analyzes of scientific articles published on hypothermia.Material and Method: Articles on hypothermia published between 1980 and 2021 were downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS) database and analyzed using various statistical and bibliometric methods. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used for correlation studies. Network visualization maps were used to identify effective studies, global collaborations, and trend topics with citation analyses.Results: Out of a total of 14410 publications, 8157 articles were analyzed. The top 5 contributors to the literature are USA (n=2938, 36%), Japan (737, 9%), UK (641, 7.8%), Germany (576, 7%), and China (544, 6%). was. The first 3 journals that published the most articles were Resuscitation (n=296), Critical Care Medicine (146), Therapeutic Hypothermia, and Temperature Management (135). The top 3 most active institutions were League of European Research Universities (n=448), University of California System (274), and Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (221). The most active author was Marianne Thoresen (n=69).Conclusion: The most studied trend topics in recent years are determined as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, neonatal encephalopathy, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, neonates, targeted management, therapeutic hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, perioperative hypothermia, emergency medicine, outcome, mortality, and perinatal asphyxia. This study will guide the authors who want to study in this area.

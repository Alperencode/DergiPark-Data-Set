Makale Başlığı: Amerikan 10 Yıllık Tahvil Faiz Oranlarına Dayanılarak BİST 100 Endeks Tahmininde Ağaç Tabanlı Regresyon Modelleri Uygulaması
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to estimate the BIST 100 index traded in Borsa Istanbul using the US Treasury 10-year benchmark bond interest rates. The 258 data obtained were analyzed with two mathematical methods used in the literature in recent years. Random Forest (RF) Model and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) Model used in the time series field are tree-based regression models used in this study. In the models used, the BIST 100 index closing prices are the dependent variable; The US Treasury 10-year benchmark bond interest rates were determined as the independent variable. During the analysis phase, 206 data were used in training the models and 52 data were used in testing the models. Whether the models were statistically successful or not was tested with the success criteria of mean squares of error (MSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE). When the results are analyzed, it is seen that the MARS model has the highest NSE value and the US Treasury 10-year benchmark bond interest rates can predict the BIST 100 index. It is thought that more successful investment decisions will be made thanks to these new methods used in the estimations made in the field of finance in our country. In addition, it is believed that the models created by the study will be developed later and shed light on other researchers.

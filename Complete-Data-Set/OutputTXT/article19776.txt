Makale Başlığı: The Mediator Role of Proactive Personality in the Effect of Psychological Empowerment on Self-Leadership: A Study for the Aviation Industry
Özet: In recent years, psychological empowerment has been a tool to solve management problems arising from the need for creativity, innovation, and flexibility. In an environment where competition is intense, meeting the needs and expectations of conscious customers is only possible with a working style that can benefit from the initiative of the personnel. The concept of self-leadership consists of the theory of self-control and includes the concepts of self-influence and self-leadership. This study examines the mediating role of proactive personality in the effect of psychological empowerment on self-leadership. In this direction, a questionnaire was applied to 406 people in the province of Istanbul, including the cabin cockpit, ground services, operations, and general directorate in the civil aviation industry. The study used a structural equation model for the analysis. As a result, it concludes that personality has a partial mediating role in the effect of psychological empowerment on self-leadership. It suggests a need for personnel who can take the initiative, manage themselves, and adapt quickly to change, especially in the aviation sector, where safety and security are the most critical factors. Accordingly, there is a need for appropriate industry professionals in recruitment, selection and placement, training and development, and talent and career management. This need will continue to grow in the future.

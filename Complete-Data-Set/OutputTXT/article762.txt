It is believed that the approach to the phases of criminal prosecution should be applied. The article provides a comparative analysis of the approaches of both classical and modern researchers to the stages of criminal prosecution in the legal literature. On the basis of extensive theoretical examinations, it is significant to consider criminal prosecution as a step-by-step process. Its implementation is differentiated in two ways - pre-trial proceedings and judicial proceedings, and the influence of the specifics of each stage on this activity is inevitable. Although there are different approaches to the content elements of this activity, it is believed that the theoretical approach is correct, and serves to determine the main direction of research and the effectiveness of experimental activities.

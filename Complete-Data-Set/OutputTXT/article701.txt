Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation on the Image of Women in Oya Katoglu's Works
Özet: Oya Katoglu, one of the most significant female artists in contemporary Turkish painting, is a versatile artist who has dealt with a wide range of topics in her paintings by employing a variety of styles. The theme of women, one of the themes that Katoglu works with, is a subject that the artist frequently uses. The painting and book cover compositions of Oya Katoglu that deal with the issue of women are explored in this context. The study's goal is to bring to light the theme of women, which is equally essential as the artist's other subjects. The absence of an academic study written on the subject makes the research important. While her early paintings concentrated on Anatolian women's lives, Katoglu eventually represented female figures in an expressive manner. The artist's works, which frequently depict this topic in her paintings, adorned the books of the women's literature world. Oya Katoglu has earned degrees by participating in competitions organized around the world in which female artists take part. Despite being a naive painter, Katoglu impacted other Turkish naive by including social and critical analyses in her topics.

Makale Başlığı: Co-existing Tumors On Suprasellar Region : A Rare Case and Re-view of Literature
Özet: Introduction: The co-existence of primary intracranial tumors originating from different cell types is rare. While the association of meningioma and glioma is frequently reported in the literature, the number of cases with meningiomas and epidermoid cysts is relatively low. We report a unique case because the association of suprasellar meningioma and the epidermoid cyst has not been reported before in the literature.Case Presentation: A 50-year-old female presented to the clinic with a headache and progressive vision loss. In cranial Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, a T1A hypointense, T2A iso-hyper intense heterogenous contrasting suprasellar mass lesion was observed. The patient was operated on with a diagnosis of suprasellar meningioma. At the suprasellar region, a mass that macroscopic view and consistency compatible with epidermoid cyst explored intraoperative incidentally. Two different pathological specimens were sent to pathology. The patient's pathology was reported as WHO 2021, Transitional type grade 1 Meningioma, and Epidermoid cyst content.Conclusion: The number of cases with meningiomas and epidermoid cysts is very low in the literature. Despite advanced MR imaging techniques, cystic lesions can be overlooked in the diagnosis. The occurrence of two different histopathological types of tumors in the same localization can be explained by the local paracrine effects of the tumors.

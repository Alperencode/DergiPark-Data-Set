Makale Başlığı: Traces of Astronomy in Historical Buildings of Erzurum
Özet: In the pre-modern period, fields such as astronomy, mathematics, and geometry were disciplinesthat were almost inseparably intertwined. People needed the data of astronomy in many areasof life. Astronomy has been applied in many subjects such as measuring time for better use, seasonalweather changes forecast, knowing the time of worship, and finding directions by usingpositions of celestial bodies. However, the effects of the movements of astronomical objects onhumans have always been a matter of curiosity. Astronomy has artistic features as well as providetechnical information. The traces of astronomy with its geometry, practical use, and aestheticdimensions of architectural structures are evident in historical works such as mosques, minarets,madrasahs, inn, baths, cupolas (gonbad), bridges, towers, and castles. In this study, the traces ofastronomical elements such as calendar and sundial were investigated by examining and photographingthe historical castles, cupolas, madrasahs, mosques, and minarets from the Saltukids,Seljuks, Ilkhanids, and Ottoman periods in the center of Erzurum. In addition, structures such asthe timekeepers house, which existed in the past but did not survive until today, were examined.Astronomy has shown its effect even in architectural structures in the past. Today, the positionthat should be between astronomy and humanity is discussed.

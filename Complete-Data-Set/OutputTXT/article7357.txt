Makale Başlığı: Determine When a Parametric Surface is a Surface of Revolution
Özet: A surface of revolution is a surface that can be generated by rotating a planar curve (the directrix)around a straight line (the axis) in the same plane. Using the mathematics of quaternions, we provide a parametricequation of a surface of revolution generated by rotating a directrix about an axis by quaternion multiplicationof the parametric representations of the directrix curve and the line of axis. Then, we describe an algorithmto determine whether a parametric surface is a surface of revolution, and identify the axis and the directrix.Examples are provided to illustrate our algorithm.

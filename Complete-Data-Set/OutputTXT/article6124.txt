Makale Başlığı: A Systematic Review of Note Taking Strategy Researches
Özet: This study aims at examining master's and doctoral theses, and scientific articles, which arewritten on note taking in Turkey, systematically and descriptively. Systematic review method wasused in the research. The research to be included in the review were obtained from the databasesof Council of Higher Education (YÖK) Thesis Center, ULAKBİM TR Index and Dergipark withkeywords. According to the findings, 83% of the studies investigate the relationship betweennotetaking and variables such as academic achievement, listening skill, and retention ofinformation in memory. 65% of the studies were conducted using experimental methods, andqualitative methods that could reveal the functioning of the teaching process and students'opinions about this process were rarely used. Many issues related to note taking such as notetaking with computers, note taking in the education of individuals in need of special education,history of notetaking, cognitive psychology and note taking have been ignored. In most of thestudies, data were collected from university and secondary school students. As a result, it emergesthat the note taking strategy should be associated with different fields, it should be handledoutside of the methods and approaches used, and data should be collected from different studygroups.

Makale Başlığı: The formation of Turkish metaphors in information technologies and a metaphor proposal
Özet: With the development of information technologies, new concepts and processes have emerged in daily life. The recognition of these concepts and processes reveals the need to produce new metaphors. Metaphors are tools that enable people to understand and explain abstract, complex, or theoretical concepts. In this study, it was aimed to localize the metaphors used in the field of information technology by taking the cultural qualities and origins of the metaphor as central. This Study is conducted with an ethnographic model, a qualitative research method. The ethnographic model enables the research topic to be studied with a cultural perspective. As a result of the study, the origins of the various metaphors used in the field of information technologies and their metaphors have been revealed, and a new metaphorical proposal has been presented by giving examples for using local metaphor in information technologies.

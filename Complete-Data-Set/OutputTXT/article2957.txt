Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Cash Flow Profiles and Financial Performances of Companies in the Period of Financial Crisis: A Research in BIST
Özet: Cash and cash management are essential for businesses. A cash flow statement is the statement of the business that is related to cash flows. The balance sheet and income statement are prepared on an accrual basis, while the cash flow statement is prepared on a cash basis. The cash flow statement consists of three parts to show the cash flows from the enterprise's operation, investment and financing activities. These three sections provide essential information for business-related interest groups. In this study, the data of 22 companies traded in the BIST in the "Metal Goods, Machinery, Electrical Equipment and Transportation Vehicles" and "Textile, Clothing and Leather" sectors were used. The balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement of the companies involved in the study were used for the 5-year period between 1998 and 2002. In the study, the performance success rankings of the enterprises according to TOPSIS were determined separately on a sector basis. Each business's cash flow statement and cash flow profiles were generated separately. Performance rankings and cash flow profiles of business on a sector basis were compared and interpreted taking into account the economic crisis. As a result it has been determined that the most successful businesses in both sectors mostly have cash flows in accordance with the model 4 (Growing Business) profile.

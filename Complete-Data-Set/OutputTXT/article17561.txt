Makale Başlığı: THE LESSEE’S CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE LEASE CONTRACT ACCORDING TO ART. 351 OF TCO
Özet: As per Art. 310 of Turkish Code of Obligations (TCO) numbered 6098, the new owner, who takes over the ownership of the leased object after the lease contract is concluded, becomes ex lege the party to the lease contract. The same legal consequence applies analogously to the cases where a limited right in rem which is not compatible with the tenancy right of the lessee is established on the leased object (Art. 311 of TCO). The new owner may put an end to the lease contract on the grounds of his/her necessity for residence of business place without waiting for the lease duration to expire. When such is the case, the lessee is entitled to claim compensation from the previous owner (previous lessor) for positive damages incurred as a result of the premature termination the contract. Compensation liability of the previous owner is based on breach of contract within the frame of Art. 112 of TCO. In this study, the lessee’s claim for compensation from the previous owner for the early termination of the lease contract pursuant to Art. 351 of TCO will be examined.

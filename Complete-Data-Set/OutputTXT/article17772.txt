Makale Başlığı: The Efficiency of Scientific Congresses and the Place of Academics in the World of Meaning
Özet: The aim of the research is to determine the diversity of activities in congresses held in different scientific disciplines, to reveal the factorsthat affect the efficiency of congresses according to academicians, and the meaning attributed to congresses. Case design was used in theresearch. The data were collected by examining the programs of congresses in different disciplines in the USA, Germany, France, Spain,England, and Turkey, which are the top 5 countries in the ICCA (2019) report according to the number of congresses, and through anopen-ended interview form developed within the scope of structured interview technique. The study group consists of 57 participants fromthe education faculties of 28 different universities using the snowball technique and criterion-based sampling technique. The followingevents stand out in the congresses: parallel paper sessions, posters, workshops, panels, invited speakers, thematic meetings, researchtrainings, special sessions conducted with subgroups such as graduate students, teachers, managers and supervisors, field trips, meetingwith authorities at the same table at meals. These include live access portals, interactive posters, and interactive discussion platformsin online congresses. A significant portion of the participants preferred face-to-face congresses to online congresses. The quality of thepapers, the expertise of the invited speakers, bringing together related disciplines in a thematic field, and the opportunity to turn thepapers into publications in qualified journals came to the fore as the factors affecting the efficiency of the congresses. In addition to beingplaces that contribute to professional development, socialization, and professional relations, congresses are interpreted as practices that gobeyond their purpose today.

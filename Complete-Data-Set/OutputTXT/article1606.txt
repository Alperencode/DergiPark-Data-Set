Makale Başlığı: Conversion of Testamentary Dispositions
Özet: Transformation of a null legal transaction into another transaction withsimilar economic consequences is called conversion. Contrary to German law,although the institution of conversion is not regulated by a general provision, it is accepted in Turkish and Swiss laws. There are different views about the legal basis of conversion. In case the elements of conversion are present,conversion is realized ex officio. As a rule, all kinds of legal transactions canbe converted, but conversion of testamentary dispositions is more importantthan of legal transactions inter vivos. Because, it is possible for the parties tocarry out the same legal transaction later on, free from the reason that led tothe nullity. However, since the validity of testamentary dispositions comes tothe fore with the death of the inheritor, it is not possible subsequently to makea nullified testamentary disposition validly. As a matter of fact, the legislatorhas clearly regulated conversion in some provisions of the law of inheritance.In addition to the aforementioned cases of legal conversion, there may beconversion in other cases where the elements of conversion are present.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of natural parasitization rate of egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) of European cornborer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in corn fields in Sakarya province
Özet: The study was carried out in corn fields of Adapazari, Akyazi, Erenler, Ferizli, Hendek, Karasu, Kocaali, Sogutlu and Serdivan (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) counties in Sakarya province to determine the rate of natural parasitism with egg parasitoid, Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) against European cormborer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn. (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in 2018 and 2019. Sampling was done weekly between June and September, and especially the leaves and under-leaf of 100 plants from each field were examined. Parasitized and non-parasitized egg masses were brought to the laboratory together with the leaf piece and cultured. The parasitized and non-parasitized O. nubilalis eggs were counted and recorded daily. The natural parasitization rate of Trichogramma brassicae in Sakarya province was 94.82% in 2018 and 40.58% in 2019. The highest natural interference occurred in 2018. When the districts are compared, the highest parasitization occurred in Ferizli district (100%), while the lowest parasitization was found in Kocaali district (21.43%).

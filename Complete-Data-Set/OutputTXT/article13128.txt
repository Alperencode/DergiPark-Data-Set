Makale Başlığı: The Effects Of The Covid-19 Crisis Process On The Informal Employment Of Women
Özet: During the Covid-19 crisis, informal working women have been the group most adversely affected by income and employment losses. In this study, in the help of the relevant literature, the effects of the Covid-19 crisis process on female informal employment are discussed within the framework of its gender-based dimensions. According to the main findings of the research, women have experienced great employment and income losses due to the fragility of the informal forms of work they participate in employment (such as domestic work, home-based jobs for industry) due to their patriarchy and gender-based characteristics, and the sensitivity of these jobs to high level of quarantine measures. The trends that emerged during the easing of epidemic measures point to the potential of the Covid-19 crisis to create a cycle of informal participation in the labor market for women. This means that participation in informal employment will increase even more for women. The Covid-19 crisis process perpetuates women's poor working conditions and gender inequality in informal jobs. For informal employment, legal recognition of informal employment, inclusion of these forms of work in the scope of social security, and implementation of legal arrangements for all working conditions, especially wage security, should be carried out urgently. Specific to women, these policies and programs should be designed within the framework of principles and practices that will transform gendered attitudes towards women, render unpaid care-housework and women's production activities in the labor market more visible and valuable in social life.

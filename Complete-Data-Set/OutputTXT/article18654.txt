Makale Başlığı: Determining Antibacterial Effect of Yellow Onion (Allium Cepa) Peel Extract on Some Pathogen Inoculated in Raw, UHT and Pasteurized Milks
Özet: In this research, yellow onion peel extract (YOPE) was tested against some pathogens inoculated into pasteurized, UHT and raw milks. Milk samples were added with YOPE at 10% (v/v) and were left at 4 ºC for 5 days. The pH and colour of milk samples were determined at 1, 3 and 5th day of storage. Moreover, the milk samples were inoculated by 0.0, 5.0 and 7.0 log cfu/mL of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and by 0.0, 5.0 and 7.0 log cfu/mL of S. aureus ATCC 25923. All the above samples were then added with YOPE at a rate of 0.0 or 5.0% (v/v). YOPE had the greatest inhibitory effect on E. coli inoculated pasteurized milk at a concentration of 7.00±0.24 log cfu/mL, whereas the lowest inhibitory effect was shown on the raw milk inoculated with 7.00±0.87 log cfu/mL S. aureus and 5.00±0.21 log cfu/mL E. coli.

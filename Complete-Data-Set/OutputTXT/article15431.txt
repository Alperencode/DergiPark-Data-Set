Makale Başlığı: Prognostic Role of Hormone Status in Endometrium Cancer
Özet: Aim: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common female reproductive system cancer in Europe and fifth leading reason of death in female cancer in worldwide. Hormone receptors are the main modulator of endometrium functions. Aim of present study was to evaluate prognostic indicator Estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in patients at FIGO stage 3 EC. Material and Methods: This study was designed as retrospective one institution analysis. ER status and PR status was enrolled from medical records of patients. Primary endpoint of this study was effect of hormone status to the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Present study enrolled 133 patients from January 2015 to October 2021. ER and hormone positivity were statistically significant in OS analysis (HR: 1.40 p:0.005 and HR:2.173 p: 0.047). PR status was insignificant statistically in both DFS and OS survival analysis (HR: 1.80 p:0.09 and HR: 1.72, p: 0.062 respectively). The median DFS and OS were 58 months (51-64) and 129 months (88-169) patients with ER positive tumor respectively (p<0.0001), whereas 19 months (17-20) and 28 months (23-32) patients with ER negative tumor (p<0.000).  Conclusion: ER positivity was with better DFS and OS and was significantly good prognostic indicator in patients with FIGO stage 3. ER positivity may be used to stratify patients in FIGO stage 3 and close follow-up may be needed in patients in ER negative.

Makale Başlığı: Incidental findings detected in coronavirus disease 2019 patients who underwent thorax computed tomography in the emergency department: a cross-sectional study
Özet: Aim: Our study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings detected in thorax computed tomography (CT) scans of patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Methods: In this retrospective, cross-sectional, observational, and single-center study, we included adult (≥18 years old) patients who were admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of COVID-19 and underwent thoracic CT between May-July 2020. Patients with incidental findings on CT scans were evaluated in three groups according to international classifications. Patient groups and patients with and without incidental findings were compared in terms of age, gender, and age distribution.Results: Incidental findings were found in 41.8% of 5,667 patients who were admitted to ED with COVID-19 symptoms and underwent thoracic CT. The mean age was significantly higher among the patients with incidental findings than among the patients without incidental findings. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender. Clinically significant findings were observed in 11.8% (n=670) of the patients. The most common incidental finding on thorax CT was atherosclerotic changes in the mediastinal main vascular structures with a rate of 27.7% (n=655). The most common clinically significant finding was cardiomegaly, with a rate of 13.7% (n=325).Conclusion: No incidental finding was found in most of the patients. On the other hand, as the age increased, the probability of detecting an incidental finding increased. Clinically insignificant findings were found in the majority of patients with incidental findings.

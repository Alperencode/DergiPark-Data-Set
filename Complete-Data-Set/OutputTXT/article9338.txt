Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION DATA IN A PRIVATE HOSPITAL
Özet: In this study, the number of services performed and the costs of these procedures were examined by detailing percutaneous coronary interventions. Data from the first month of 2018 to the end of the third month of 2019, which were applied to patients who applied to the cardiology department in a private hospital in Kocaeli, were evaluated. As a result of our investigation, it was observed that male patients were approximately twice as common as female patients. It has been determined that the number of transactions performed decreases especially in the summer months and increases towards the winter months. In the light of the data obtained, it has been revealed that people should pay attention to the winter months in terms of heart health. In addition, it was revealed that the age range of 61-75 years was the age when the most transactions were made. It is understood that the most costly in terms of cost is the medicated stent. In this context, it is understood that the procedures performed for patients of average age put a lot of burden on the institutions. If deductions are made by considering the costs reflected to the institutions in terms of community heart health, it is predicted that raising the awareness of health protection in our country in order to reduce health expenditures will benefit both the individual and the state.

Makale Başlığı: EU Progress Reports in AK Party Period Democratic Transformation Of Civil-Military Relatıonship in Context
Özet: In Turkey, the military played an active role in politics with institutional restructuring, which has always been intertwined politically, with four military coups and civilian governments. The European Commission has been criticizing Turkey for its progress on the issue since 1998, especially when the military is not subject to civilian denial. With the Helsinki Summit that took place in 1999, the European Union began its membership process and civil-military relations in Turkey have undergone a major transformation with many constitutional reforms and institutional changes. In this context, the DSP-MHP-ANAP coalition government and the AKP governments have made important institutional reforms to ensure democratic control of the armed forces. In 18 years after leaving the army, which has the authority of guardianship over politics, far from the necessary supervision and control against the civilian authority, the majority of the powers which it possesses as a result of these reforms are lost. In this study, critics of civil-military relations will be reviewed in these progress reports, limited to the progress reports submitted to Turkey by the European Union and how the weakening of the constitutional arrangements (such as the MGK) in Turkey, especially with the legal and constitutional reforms made against these criticisms during the AK Party period, will enable the army to intervene in politics. In the conclusion part, suggestions about the topic will be made.

Makale Başlığı: Techno-economic Feasibility Study of a Solar PV-Diesel System for Applications in Northern Part of Bangladesh
Özet: Renewable energy offers convenient energy solution to the population live in isolated areas. The residents can utilize the locally available energy resources for fulfilling their need for electricity. The availability of electricity in the darkness of night facilitates higher productivity irrespective of gender. In this paper, design of a solar PV-diesel mini-grid system has been presented for a locality in Char Parbotipur (25.75°N 89.66°E). This island is situated 20 km north-east from Kurigram district, Bangladesh and surrounded by Brahmaputra river and Dudhkumar river, far from the national grid. Very few residents use stand-alone Solar Home Systems (SHS) and diesel generators. Diesel generators have environmental concern which can be minimized by using hybrid renewable energy systems. This paper aims at designing an optimal energy system consisting solar PV having diesel generator for fulfilling the load demand. The proposed energy system can generate electricity at a cost of $0.461/kWh for a load of 115 kWh/day. Sensitivity analysis is presented to understand the effect of diesel price and solar irradiation on the cost of electricity and net present cost of the system. Comparison between the proposed hybrid renewable energy system and an energy system comprising diesel generator only are also presented to understand the effect of solar PV integration with diesel generators for environmental benefits.

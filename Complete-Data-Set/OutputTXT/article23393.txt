Makale Başlığı: Researchs on drying of some seeded local raisins cultivars grown in Gercüş (Batman) province
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the drying performances and raisin qualities in different dipping solutions and different drying sites of Bineteti and Zeyti grape cultivars, which are evaluated as drying in Gercüş province. In the study, dipping solutions obtained from mixtures in different proportions of potassium carbonate (3-5%) and olive oil (1-1.5%) and two different drying sites (on concrete and on concrete + canvas fabric) were used and the grapes were dried under sun light. Drying time, drying efficiency, 100 raisin weight, surface color values [L*, a*, b*, hue (h°) and croma (C*)], total acidity, pH, soluble solids content (SSC), total phenolic content and antioxidant activitiy parameters of obtained raisins were determined. It was determined that in the concrete drying site, dipped grapes dried 8 day in Bineteti cultivar and 9 day in Zeyti cultivar earlier than control (natural) and in the concrete + canvas fabric drying site, both cultivars also dried 10 day earlier than control (natural). It was determined that in the raisins, drying efficiency varied between 24.31-26.54% in Bineteti cultivar, 18.63-20.20% in Zeyti cultivar, 100 raisin weight varied between 127.98-142.80 g in Bineteti cultivar, 77.27-88.06 g in Zeyti cultivar, L* value varied between 28.25-39.77 in Bineteti cultivar, 30.20-39.83 in Zeyti cultivar, total phenolic content varied between 203.18-290.35 µg GAE/ml in Bineteti cultivar, 134.30-235.05 µg GAE/ml in Zeyti cultivar, antioxidant activity varied between 83.46-93.16% in Bineteti cultivar, 78.18-90.48% in Zeyti cultivar.

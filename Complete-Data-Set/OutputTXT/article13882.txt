Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Financial Performance of Enterprises in Terms of Financial Structure Ratios
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the financial structures of the companies operating in the Borsa Istanbul Transportation Index (XULAS) for the years 2016-2020 by examining their financial structures for the years 2016-2020 and to rank the companies according to their financial performance using the integrated Entropy-TOPSIS method. In the study, the ratios related to the financial structures of the companies that continue their activities in the Borsa Istanbul transportation index for the period of 2016-2020 were calculated. Afterwards, the criteria weights of these ratios were calculated using the Entropy method, and the companies in question were ranked according to their performance with the TOPSIS analysis technique. As a result of the information obtained as a result of the study, it has been determined that the financial performance of the companies differs every year. However, it has been observed that U2 coded (Çelebi Hava Servis A.Ş) and U5 coded Reysaş Taşımacılık Ve Lojistik Ticaret A.Ş companies in the 5-year period taken into consideration generally take the first place and therefore their financial performance is better. In addition, it has been determined that the financial structure ratios of U1 coded (Beyaz Filo Oto Kiralama A.Ş) and U3 coded (Gsd Denizcilik Gayrimenkul İnşaat Sanayi Ve Ticaret A.Ş) companies are low and they are generally in the 5th and 6th rank

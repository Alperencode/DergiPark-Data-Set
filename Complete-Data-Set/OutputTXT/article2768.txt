Makale Başlığı: Development of Cost-Benefit Analysis Calculation Tool for Pressure Control in Urban Water Management
Özet: Operating conditions deteriorate depending on the density of failures in urban water management. The most important factor in the occurrence of failures is the high pressure in the system and the fluctuation in the pressure. Therefore, it is necessary to control the pressure and reduce the fluctuations in order to reduce the occurrence of new faults. However, pressure control is a costly process that requires extensive fieldwork. Therefore, before applying pressure management, the costs (equipment, field works, and installation) and benefits (potential water volume to be added to the system, potential reductions in failure) should be considered. The aim of this study is to develop a calculation tool to analyse the costs and benefits of applying pressure management in an isolated zone. For this purpose, cost components were defined according to field data. In addition, based on the approaches suggested in the literature, reductions in leakage and failure rates due to pressure control are determined. These fault and cost components are defined in the developed calculation tool. It is thought that this developed calculation tool will be a reference especially for practitioners. In this calculation tool, cost-benefit components are also defined for isolated site studies.

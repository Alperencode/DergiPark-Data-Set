Makale Başlığı: Züleyha's Femme Fatale Personality in the Context of Yusuf u Züleyha by Hamdullah Hamdi
Özet: As women began to take more part in society, the term "femme fatale", which we frequently encountered in the literature, was defined in general; She is defined as the woman who brings disaster if the relationship is entered. One of the most remarkable examples of this concept in Eastern literatures, which has its roots in mythical and religious narratives, is Zuleyha. Zuleyha, about whom there is no detailed information about herself in the holy books, was widely described in the works by the masnavi writers. His love for Yusuf and his conflict with himself and the characters around him reveals his femme fatale identity. In this article, the characteristics of the femme fatale type will be mentioned and some social perspectives that shape the perception of women, especially in Hebrew society, will be revealed. Zuleyha's position in the Torah and the Qur'an will be discussed by referring to the perception of women in Divan literature, and then Zuleyha's fatale identity will be discussed in the context of Hamdullah Hamdi's masnavi.

Makale Başlığı: Magnetic and Structural Characterization of Permalloy (Ni79Fe21) Thin Films with Uniaxial Magnetic Anisotropy
Özet: In this study, the structural and magnetic properties of permalloy thin films with thicknesses varying from 4 to 20 nm on Si (100) / SiO2 (~ 200 nm) substrate were investigated. Permalloy thin films were prepared in a high vacuum chamber using the oblique angle magnetron sputtering technique. From the in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, the alloy composition ratio of permalloy was found as 21% Fe and 79% Ni. X-ray diffraction and reflectivity measurements showed that permalloy films grew in (111) orientation with low surface roughness and at the nominal thicknesses. Magnetic properties were investigated using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) techniques. In-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy was observed in the films due to the oblique deposition used in film preparation. Experimental FMR data were simulated by writing a computer code using the free energy minimization method according to the magnetization direction, and thus these uniaxial anisotropy constants of the films were determined. In addition, variations of magnetic properties such as coercive field and anisotropy field depending on thickness are discussed.

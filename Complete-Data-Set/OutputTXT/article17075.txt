Makale Başlığı: Writing Comparative Phonetics of the Turkic Dialects
Özet: Many studies were done in the past on the phonetic structure of Turkic and it continues to be done today. Most of these studies evaluate each Turkic dialect in its own way. However, in some etymology studies and in various articles and theses, comparative phonetic analyse is also made. These evaluations do not give a detailed result in terms of phonetics about the whole Turkic and they maintain their value as various information. As of the point reached in the studies on the Turkic, it is a great task to write the comparative phonetics of Turkic dialects. In this study, the importance and necessity of such study will be emphasized through examples.

Makale Başlığı: Positive periodic solutions for a class of second-order differential equations with state-dependent delays
Özet: In this paper, we consider a class of second order differential equations with iterative source term. The main results are obtained by virtue of a Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem and some useful properties of a Green's function which allows us to prove the existence of positive periodic solutions. Finally, an example is included to illustrate the correctness of our results.

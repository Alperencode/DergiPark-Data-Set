Makale Başlığı: A GA-based adaptive mechanism for sensorless vector control of induction motor drives for urban electric vehicles
Özet: Induction motors are more attractive to car manufacturers because they are more robust and more cost  effective to maintain in comparison with other types of electric machines. The evolution of their control makes them  more efficient and less expensive. However, a new control technique known as sensorless control is being used to simplify  the implementation of electric machines in electric vehicles. This technique involves replacing the flux and speed sensors  with an observer. The estimation of these elements is based on the measurement of currents and voltages. The main  purpose of the present study is to design a novel robust structure of the sensorless vector control for an urban electric  vehicle. The proposed structure aims to improve the accuracy of dynamics at low speeds, eliminate sensitivity to the  machine's parameters, and maintain the stability of the system even if the variation reaches high values. The speed  estimation is ensured by an enhanced PI adaptation mechanism based on the full order Luenberger observer. The proof  of this stability is based on the Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, a GA-based adaptive control is used for self-tuning of the  stator resistance. By combining these techniques, we can enhance the efficiency and stability of the whole system.

Makale Başlığı: THE ROLE OF POLITICAL CULTURE IN UNSUSTAINABLE PEACE-BUILDING: THE CASE OF HAITI
Özet: With the end of the Cold War, it is seen that the suppressed conflicts in many parts of the World have appeared. On the other hand, it is known that international organizations carry out various activities in the resolution of conflicts, the initiation of peace phases, its protection, and control. Among these, the United Nations (UN) is an organization that has the most active role. In this study, while the conflicts that took place in Haiti and the causes of the conflicts are discussed in the context of different periods; the peacebuilding processes of the United Nations against the current conflicts are examined. According to the findings obtained from the study, the political culture of both Haiti and the interventionist states brought to the region is seen as the main reason for the conflicts. In addition, it is concluded that the peacebuilding efforts created by the UN stopped the conflicts in Haiti in the short term, however, it could not build/preserve positive peace in the long term.

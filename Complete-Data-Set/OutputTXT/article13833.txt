Makale Başlığı: Islamic Mobile Applications Produced in Turkey in Google Play Store: A Thematic Analysis
Özet: This study discusses Islamic mobile applications produced in Turkey in the mobile application store entitled “Google Play Store”. The increase in the number of mobile applications with every passing day and the continued expansion in their field of use, and moreover their interactiveness and functionality make a study in this field necessary. The aim of this study is to examine and categorize Islamic mobile applications, determine the common types of applications and present a thematic analysis concerning the varieties, content and functions of these applications. 724 Islamic mobile applications produced in Turkey, which are included in “Google Play Store”, were determined and examined in line with this aim. While the quantitative data of the study (the number of applications in the category, the download rate and average scores) was analyzed using the SPSS 23 program, the qualitative data (the word cloud and the graphics) was analyzed using the MAXQDA 2020 program. In addition to this, the applications were also interpreted thematically based on 6 categories – “worship and rituals”, “mobile learning and education”, “lifestyle and consumption practices”, “interaction and communication tools”, “game and entertainment culture” and “the practices of daily life”. As a result, it was determined that religious knowledge and practices are also being carried to digital platforms as a necessity of the digital age, and that “content /service providers” are being produced in a manner which includes the different social categories that take into account the likes of religious individuals. The fact that there are no other studies which examine, categorize and thematically analyze Islamic mobile applications produced in Turkey makes the study original for the literature.

Makale Başlığı: Is “Inclusive Education” Possible? Examining the Opinions of Pre-service Teachers Who Take the Inclusive Education Course with Vignette Technique
Özet: In Turkey, research on inclusive education has recently showed a substantial surge. One of the main reasons for this scholarly interest is that inclusive education is offered as an elective subject in education faculties, and the refugee and immigrant population in Turkey, as well as the rest of the world, is on the rise. However, in order to properly comprehend inclusive education, both in terms of teacher education and for the future of inclusive education in our country, it is necessary to go into greater detail in the academic studies conducted. This study looked at the perspectives of pre-service teachers who underwent an inclusive education course. The study preferred the case study design, which is a type of qualitative research. The research group comprises of 56 teacher candidates (32 females and 24 males) who are currently enrolled in a state university's college of education. The Vignette technique was used to collect research data online in a semi-structured way. The data was analyzed using thematic content analysis. According on the opinions of the pre-service instructors, seven different themes emerged at the conclusion of the study. These are self-efficacy, teamwork, classroom management, teacher profile, interaction, educational sustainability, and instructional differentiation. Some recommendations for inclusive teacher education were offered in the context of the findings.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Organic Acid Kinetics in Tarhana Dough During Fermentation and Drying
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the organic acid profile of tarhana dough during fermentation and drying. The content of oxalic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid, malonic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, succinic acid and propionic acid in tarhana samples were taken on the 0th, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th days of fermentation and on the 16th, 17th, 19th, and 21st days of drying in tarhana and samples were analyzed via high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). It was determined that the organic acids found at the highest levels during both fermentation and drying processes were lactic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid. In addition, according to the Pearson Correlation test, no correlation was observed between succinic acid with other organic acids and between tartaric acid and propionic acid. The highest correlation was found between lactic acid and acetic (r=0.911, p<0.01). It is thought that our study will contribute to tarhana soup being a functional food by providing an idea about the organic acids that can be found in the product while making tarhana soup.

Makale Başlığı: An Assessment of Researches on the Menemen (Kubilay) Event
Özet: The year 1930 is an important year in which fluctuations in domestic politics were experienced due to the effects of various domestic and foreign events, especially the domestic repercussions of the 1929 economic depression. Being aware of the unrest in the domestic environment, Gazi Mustafa Kemal drew attention to the need for an opposition party to solve this situation, and for this purpose, Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası (the Free Republican Party) was established by Ali Fethi Okyar. However, this experience did not create the desired peace environment and even caused new chaos. It is the Menemen (Kubilay) Incident that brings about the developments that will come from this chaos. The Menemen (Kubilay) Incident, which brought about the developments that will cause the regime to harden in the country, has been one of the most discussed issues in our recent history. At this point, the information about the event differs. In this article different studies on the subject have been tried to be examined and analyzed in terms of the way they deal with the subject and their results in order to eliminate these differences.

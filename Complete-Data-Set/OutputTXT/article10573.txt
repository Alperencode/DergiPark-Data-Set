Makale Başlığı: Tests That Can Be Done to Employees and Employee Candidates Under the Personal Data Protection Law No. 6698
Özet: The Personal Data Protection Law No. 6698 entered into force on 7 April 2016 after being published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey No. 29677. The effects of this law have been felt by employers since the day it was enacted. Employers, on the other hand, deal with personal data firsthand, both in the execution of employee candidate recruiting operations and in the execution of employee business procedures. As such, it is critical to evaluate the psychotechnical and physical tests that employers can conduct for employee candidates and employees within the scope of this law, while evaluating job applications of employee candidates and auditing the activities of employees within the scope of employment contracts, which are frequently preferred by employers today. Employers should, in particular, treat personal data of employee applicants and workers in accordance with data processing conditions. This article discusses and evaluates psychotechnical and physical tests that employers can administer to employment applicants and workers within the framework of the applicable law.

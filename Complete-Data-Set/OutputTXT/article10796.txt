Makale Başlığı: PROBLEMS OF FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN THE LOCAL PRESS
Özet: Along with the structure shaped by social norms, there is a male-dominated employee profile in the media sector. This structure in the mainstream press is similarly seen in the local press. In this study, the problems experienced by female employees in the local press were discussed. Interviews were conducted with 4 local journalists selected from the provinces of Zonguldak and Bolu, which were selected as samples. According to the data obtained from the interviews, issues such as working for low wages, the existence of untrained personnel, reporting for profit, being assigned to unimportant news came to the fore. As a result, the number of female employees working in settlements with small populations is less than that of males. Women journalists are asked to take more roles in the background and are directed to unimportant news.

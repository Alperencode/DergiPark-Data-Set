Makale Başlığı: DNA damage and inflammation in COVID-19 cases
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study is to see oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG), its relationship with inflammatory mediators (IL6 and TNFA), and its reflections on laboratory findings in patients who had COVID-19 infection at different intensities.Materials and Methods: Serum interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA), and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured using kits based on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle.Results: In COVID-19 positive patients treated in intensive care 8-OHdG marker level is at the highest level and statistically significant. In patients receiving inpatient treatment in the hospitalized, the 8-OHdG marker level is higher than the control and outpatient groups. IL6 values were at the highest level in the patient group treated in the intensive care unit and were higher than the outpatient and control groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the control and patient groups in terms of TNFA values.  Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was lower in the control group than in all patient groups. C-reactive protein (CRP) is higher in hospitalized patients than in the control group. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was found to be statistically significantly higher in hospitalized patients than outpatients.Conclusion: As the severity of COVID-19 increases, serum 8-OHdG and IL6 levels also increase. These parameters can guide the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in the early stages of the disease course.

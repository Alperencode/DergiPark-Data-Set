Makale Başlığı: Adaptation of Leadership Capacity School Survey (LCSS) into Turkish: The Validity and Reliability Study
Özet: The purpose of this study was to adapt &quot;Leadership Capacity School Survey-LCSS&quot; originally developed by Lambert (2003) into Turkish culture. A total of 299 participants including teachers and administrators employed in primary schools in Ankara participated in the study. Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were performed to test the structural validity of the scale. EFA results illustrated that adapted scale consisted of four factors. In the light of the original scale form and relevant literature, these factors were named as &quot;Distributive Leadership&quot;, &quot;Shared School Vision&quot;, &quot;Collaboration and Collective Responsibility&quot; and &quot;Perceived Student Achievement&quot;.  	  	The scale consisted of 30 items and four answer choices as &quot;We do not do this at our school.&quot;, &quot;We are starting to move in this direction.&quot;, &quot;We are making good progress here.&quot;, and &quot;We have this condition well established&quot;. Factor loadings of the items in the scale ranged from .41 to .89, corrected itemtotal correlations from .65 to .83, and reliability coefficients for the subscales from .91 and .94. DFA results also showed that the scale had high goodness-of-fit values. Results finally revealed that Leadership Capacity School Survey-Turkish Adapted Form was a valid and reliable measurement tool to be used in describing the leadership capacity of elementary and secondary schools.

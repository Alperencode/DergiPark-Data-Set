Makale Başlığı: Comparison of antiresorptive agents in the treatment of osteoporosis in older adults
Özet: Purpose: There are few studies comparing the effectiveness of anti-osteoporotic drugs among elderly population. In this study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of alendronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab in older adults. Materials and Methods: A total of 350 older adults with osteoporosis, aged 65 and over were included in this retrospective study. The number of patients receiving alendronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab was 111, 121, and 118, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at baseline and 24th month by performing dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.Results: The age, comorbidities, and laboratory analysis results of the patients were similar. While there was no statistically significant difference in BMD response at the femoral neck between the treatment groups (Baseline BMDs for alendronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab were 0.61, 0.59, and 0.58, respectively, while 24th month BMDs were 0.62, 0.60, and 0.59, respectively), alendronate and zoledronic acid improved lumbar spine BMD more than denosumab (Baseline BMDs for alendronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab were 0.74, 0.74, and 0.71, respectively, while 24th month BMDs were 0.77, 0.78, and 0.73).Conclusion: This study has shown that, like parenteral antiresorptive agents, alendronate can elicit a desirable BMD response in older osteoporotic adults.  The results of our study may guide osteoporosis treatment in older individuals.

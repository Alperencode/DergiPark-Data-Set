Makale Başlığı: Migration and Culture
Özet: The phenomenon of migration, which is identical to the history of humanity, reflects the multidimensional process of change and transformation in terms of causes, consequences, actors, life units that receive migration and give migration. The phenomenon of migration, which provides for the re-establishment of the human-space relationship, leaves deep traces in the social life, cultural practices, values system of societies in their social, cultural, economic, demographic and ecological aspects. In this aspect, Prof. Dr. Ismail DOĞAN's Migration and Cultural work reveals a holistic view of the current practices of the migration phenomenon, structure and actor problems in terms of meaning and content in a theoretical context. Migration and Culture, in which the sociological analysis of the migration phenomenon is examined with a historical chronology, has offered suggestions for a rational, sustainable and scientific solution to the migration experiences of the Ottoman-Turkish society. Although it is accepted that Türkiye has a rich social and cultural migration experience in the study, it has been stated that there are still insufficient lessons to be learned from current migration events. In this context, it is necessary for public and civil society actors to create long-term and joint solutions in coordination.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Antibacterial Effect of Honey on ESBL and Biofilm-Producing Enterobacterales
Özet: Mastitis is a mammary gland inflammatory disease that causes milk yield reduction and economic losses. Mastitis is bacteriological and antibiotics are usually used for treatment. Alternative natural treatment methods such as bee products, phytotherapy, and essential oils were evaluated to reduce the use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis. In this study, the in vitro antibacterial effect of flower and oak honey samples dissolved in distilled water and boric acid (2%) on ESBL and biofilm-producing Enterobacterales pathogens was investigated. The aim was to establish the usability of honey/boric acid solution against mastitis as a natural antiseptic solution for bovine udder surfaces. Honey samples were studied by dissolving in distilled water and boric acid (2%) solvents. There was no significant statistical difference between honey solutions using distilled water and boric acid (p>0.05). Antibacterial effects were increased according to the increasing honey proportion in flower honey solutions. However, the antibacterial activity of oak honey dissolved in boric acid solution was higher than dissolved in distilled water. As a result of the statistical correlation analysis between flower and oak honey samples, antibacterial effects of flower honey samples were determined to be higher than oak honey samples (p<0.05) (R=0.825). An alternative formulation for mastitis treatment with honey and boric acid was developed for the first time in the literature.

Makale Başlığı: Social and Demographic Factors Influencing the Complication Rates After Total Knee Arthroplasty
Özet: Social and demographic factors are important factors that influence outcomes in a number of medical conditions but their role in total knee arthroplasty is poorly understood. The effect of social, demographic and clinical factors on complication rates after total knee arthroplasty was evaluated in this study. This multicentre retrospective study included 164 patients (45 men, 119 women; mean age 68 years; range 52 to 81 years) undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The body mass index , anaesthesia type, ASA score, operation time and chronicity of the pain were recorded, together with marital status, education, smoking habit and living style of the patients. Complications were also noted from regular first 2-year follow-up examinations. Regarding to the gender, body mass index, anaesthesia type and operation time, there was no differences between the patients who had postoperative complication or not (p>0.05). Patients who have complications have higher age (p=0.041), ASA score (p=0.028) and chronic pain duration (p=0.000). Patients who lived alone or lived in nursing home, were not married, had low education level and smoked, had higher complication rates (p<0.05). Postoperative complication rate was not related with gender and body mass index of the patients, anaesthesia type and operation time. Higher age, ASA score and duration of chronicity, lower education level, living by oneself or in nursing home and smoking habit increase the complication rates after total knee arthroplasty. Patients should be informed about these risk factors as part of the strategy to prevent complications after total knee arthroplasty.

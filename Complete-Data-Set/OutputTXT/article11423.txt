Makale Başlığı: Textual Analysis of Twitter Posts in the First Months of The Covid-19 Pandemic.
Özet: Aim: This study aimed to analyze the content of tweets about the coronavirus to improve our understanding of public emotions and thoughts during the pandemic. Methods: Our study was conducted between 11th March 2020 to 5th May 2020. Using a Java-based software application, the data was extracted from Twitter on pre-defined English and Turkish keywords. The data collected was examined and divided according to 5 pre-established categories (measures to be taken for COVID-19, COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 current, and future treatments, conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak) using a word-based Levenshtein distance algorithm with focus on the treatment and measures category. Results: 87.264.342 tweets were analyzed with machine learning techniques and algorithms. After excluding retweets and advertisements a total of 5,529,891 tweets related to coronavirus were included in the study. Of the selected data, 32.3% (n = 1786000) was categorized as measures to be taken for COVID-19 and 15.7% (n = 867403) as sentiments about current and future treatments. Our findings suggest that most posts in the treatment and prevention methods category in the first two weeks of the study are related to informal and unscientific content. Conclusion: Authorities should focus on disseminating reliable and precise information about precautions and treatment research during this period and ensure that non-scientific resources do not become viral about a pandemic such as COVID-19.

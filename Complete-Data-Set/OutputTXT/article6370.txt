Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Multidisciplinary Approaches Provided with Consultations  in Palliative Care Service
Özet: Aim: With the aging population, chronic diseases are increasing, and many patients with high comorbidities are admitted to palliative care services. Consultations and opinions from various branches facilitate the multidisciplinary approach. In this study, the multidisciplinary approaches provided by the consultations requested to the patients hospitalized in the palliative care service were evaluated.Material and Methods: Patients treated in Eskişehir City Hospital Palliative Care Service between January and April 2021 were analyzed retrospectively.Results: In the study, 70 patients included, 48.6% (n=34) were female, and the mean age was 73.4 (27-97). 30% of the patients had malignancies. 25.7% applied directly from home (n=18), 18.6% came from different services (n=13) and 55.7% came from intensive care units (n=39). 72.9% were discharged (n=51), 25.7% were exitus (n=18) and 1.43% were transferred to intensive care (n=1). It was found that 72.9% (n=51) of the participants were requested consultation. It has been determined that the most frequent consultations belonged to the infectious diseases department and physical therapy and rehabilitation department. In contrast, the number of internal medicine and its subspecialties branches and algology consultations was low. It was found that consultation was not requested from 27.1% (n=19) of the patients.Conclusions: Many patient groups, from cancer patients to dementia, are hospitalized in the palliative care service. As the comorbid disease of the patient increases, the number of consultations increases. In our study, it was determined that the most frequently consulted branch was infectious diseases. It was thought that the low number of consultations of algology and internal diseases and sub-branches in the study was related to the fact that the relevant branches are following the patient with a broad perspective in the palliative service. The study evaluated the lack of algology consultation with internal diseases and subspecialties because internal diseases and anesthesia specialists were observing the patient with a broad perspective. The high rate of patients discharged to home, and the fact that they can be followed at home may result from the multidisciplinary approach in palliative care. The establishment of interdisciplinary communication, opinions, and suggestions requested from related branches in palliative care will contribute to the professional and healthy management of the process.

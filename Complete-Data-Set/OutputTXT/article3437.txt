Makale Başlığı: Content Structure of University Radio Stations in Turkey As Part of Their Broadcast Policy
Özet: The aim of this study was to examine to what extent university radio stations in Turkey are an alternative to popular, commercial radio stations by analyzing the program content and general approaches within the framework of their music and program policies. Using the qualitative research method, in-depth interviews were carried out with the employees and representatives of 25 public and 9 foundation university radio stations across various regions and different cities of Turkey. Twenty university radio stations were examined on site by direct observations and face-to-face interviews, and we interviewed the representatives of 14 university radio stations via telephone or video communication. All interviewees were asked the same semistructured questions. Furthermore, the supervisors of the 11 sample radio stations who archive their programs regularly selected some of the programs and shared their archives with the researchers. These selected programs were analyzed in terms of the duration of talk and music, and categorized according to the production elements. It was found that university radio stations in Turkey have problems with content production for various reasons and are exposed to certain restrictions. Therefore, in contrast to international practices and the existing literature, they have content similar to that of commercial radio stations, rather than broadcasting alternative content.

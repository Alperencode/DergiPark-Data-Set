Makale Başlığı: THE IMAGE OF SAUDI ARABIA THROUGH STUDENTS OF IMAM HATİP SCHOOL
Özet: In recent years, the values that countries have and how they are perceived in the international community have become the research topic of many disciplines. Countries have realized that just being strong in political, technological and military terms is not enough to have a say in world politics. For this reason, they make great efforts to manage their image to the extent they desire. In the study, the country image of Saudi Arabia was tried to be determined in the sample of Imam Hatip School students. For this purpose, a face-to-face survey was conducted with the students of Imam Hatip School (n=300) in the Ladik neighborhood of Sarayönü district of Konya, using the purposeful sampling method. In the analysis of the research, primarily validity and reliability tests were applied. In addition, Frequency Analysis, Arithmetic Average, Factor Analysis and T-test Analyzes were applied. As a result of the analysis it is reached that there is the opinion that the pilgrimage and umrah visits in the Kaaba greatly contribute to the image of Saudi Arabia, it has the image of an economically developed country, but there is a gender discrimination in the context of fundamental rights. In addition to this, a total of 3 different factors have been identified that meet the concepts of modernity, standard of living and tolerance.

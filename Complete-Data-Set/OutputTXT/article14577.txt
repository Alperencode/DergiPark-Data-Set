Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Digital Technologies on Privacy
Özet: In this study, the links between the intellectual background that creates technological progress and tools and the visual culture that dominates today's world are examined and the relation of this relationship with the loss of privacy we experience is tried to be revealed. Like all human productions, technology is an ideological phenomenon that bears traces of the view on human, nature and life. Technological tools, connected with various economic and social interests, are at the center of ethical discussions as well as transforming ways of thinking and living. In contrast to a more cautious and slow-developing technology understanding in pre-industrial societies, in harmony with the rhythm and ideals of life, technological progress in modern culture has become the essence that governs attitudes and understandings about life itself. Modern technology, which does not recognize any traditional, moral or religious boundaries, has created a culture of thinking and understanding that centers visuality as a mediator of various political and economic power processes. This new culture, where seeing and being seen is blessed, brought about the disregard of the principles of privacy that governed life in pre-industrial societies, and many details about the private sphere began to be exposed to satisfy various psychological desires or to obtain economic benefits. While new communication technologies encourage surveillance, individuals take away their control over these tools in exchange for spesfic pleasures, and privacy becomes a victim of power and consumption.

Makale Başlığı: An Opposition Mechanism To The Commander-in-Chief Mustafa Kemal Pasha: Harp Encümeni Fevkâladesi
Özet: The most serious attempt to limit the authority of the Commander-in-Chief, which was given to Mustafa Kemal Pasha before the Battle of Sakarya and continued until the advert of the Republic, was the proposal to establish a War Committee, which was submitted to the Parliament on 12 December 1921. Later on, this proposal evolved into the Harp Encümeni Fevkaladesi. The aim of the Harp Encümeni Fevkaladesi is to limit the powers given to the Commander-in-Chief and to ensure that the Assembly is more involved in the administration. The no-confidence motion submitted by Lazistan Deputy Osman Bey and his friends in a closed session on October 27, 1921 the “Ordunun İlbas ve İaşesi” was the origin process leading to the Harp Encümeni Fevkaladesi. With this motion, criticisms about the fact that the army could not perform its backward services were brought to the agenda. It has been implicitly claimed that the Commander-in-Chief did not do his duty well. Proposal given by the dissidents in the parliament on October 27r was followed by the motion on 8 December 1921 the “Ordu Levazımatı, Vaziyeti Harbiye ve Askeriye”. With no-confidence questions, the opponents questioned the powers of the Commander-in-Chief and wanted to have a say in the administration by forming the Harp Encümeni Fevkâladesi. In the article, the process leading to the Harp Encümeni with the motions of no confidence and the attempt to limit the powers of Commander-in-Chief Mustafa Kemal Pasha through this committee will be examined.

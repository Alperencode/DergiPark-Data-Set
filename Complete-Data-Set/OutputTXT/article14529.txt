Makale Başlığı: Weed-Crop Plant Interaction: Competition
Özet: Competition is expressed as the struggle for survival and the continuation of existence. Comptition within the plant community is a negative interaction in which plant species simultaneously make demands that exceed limited resources, while both plants struggle to survive while one struggles less. Similarly, crop-weed competition is the relationship between two or more species in which the supply of resources required for growth falls below the total demand. Competition does not take place when the resources required for growth are abundant. However, it starts immediately when the supply of growth factors becomes insufficient. Crop-weed competition arises from two situations. While the first of these is direct competition for nutrients, moisture, light and space, the other is through the exudation and / or production of allelopathic chemicals, which are expressed as indirect competition. Serious yield losses occur in agricultural production areas as a result of competition emerging in weed crop interaction. Knowing the critical period in weed control is important in preventing losses caused by this competition. In this review, resources required for direct competition and the results of competition, critical period issues are discussed.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Electromagnetic Field Levels and Student Exposure at Aydın Adnan Menderes University Central Campus
Özet: With the effect of developing technology, humanity is constantly exposed to more electromagnetic fields. Regional studies are gaining importance for determining the possible problems. In this study, extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) measurements were carried out in Aydın Adnan Menderes University Central Campus in areas where university students are frequently found, at 25 randomly selected points, in the region where high voltage lines pass and around transformers, and to evaluate the awareness of university students about the ELF-EMF they are exposed to. For this purpose, the necessary magnetic field and electric field strength measurements were made and a questionnaire was applied to determine the awareness level of the students. Results were evaluated by comparing them with the ICNIRP limit values. Accordingly, it has been concluded that Aydın Adnan Menderes University Central Campus can be accepted as a relatively safe area since electromagnetic field exposure values are within the ICNIRP safe limit values. In addition, as a result of the questionnaire, it was determined that the young people were conscious to a certain extent about ELF-EMF, but they did not pay attention to protect themselves against the possible effects of ELF-EMF. It is important to make the necessary initiatives in order to raise awareness of young people on this issue.

Makale Başlığı: The Turkish writing of the Arabic words in the Encyclopedia of Islâm of the Turkish Diyanet Foundation and an investigation according to the rules of the Turkish Language Association
Özet: In this article, it has been examined how the words originally in Arabic are met according to Turkish phonetic in the Turkish Diyanet Foundation’s Encyclopedia of Islam (DIA). In the research, the current dictionary and spelling decisions of the Turkish Language Association (TDK) are taken as a criterion and the Turkish spelling of Arabic words is mentioned in a comparative way. In addition, the internal consistency of the spellings of the Arabic origin words in the TDV Encyclopedia of Islam was checked according to the TDK spelling rules. As a result of these checks, it has been shown whether there is consistency in the writing of any word or in the application of a spelling rule. In the study, words of Arabic origin were examined within the framework of titles such as letter changes, pronunciation of additional words, correction marks (hat), consonant hardening, spelling unity and spelling of some terms, transcription/transliteration marks, use of apostrophe and reverse apostrophe, spelling of some proper nouns. Turkish pronunciation forms, transcription system and spelling rules are used in the writing of foreign words. It is seen that DIA has a very successful edition in terms of TDK writing rules from the first volume to the last volume. However, since the phonetics of Arabic differs significantly from Turkish, the Turkish spelling and pronunciation of some words poses a problem. In the article, some suggestions were made about the correct spellings of these words in DIA.

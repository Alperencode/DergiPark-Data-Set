Makale Başlığı: Examination of ex-libris studies prepared with computer design and linoleum printing
Özet: This study aimed to measure the usage levels of design elements and principles by evaluating the ex-libris works, which were put forward by art teacher education students' computer-aided design and linoleum printing technique. It was also examined if there was a meaningful difference among design elements and principles according to types of printing techniques. In the study, a survey design was used. Original printmaking art studio 3rd and 4th-grade students and elective art studio 4th-grade students designed black and white ex-libris works. An "Exlibris Evaluation Form" was employed to evaluate outcomes. As a result of the study, the design elements' use corresponds to the success. The use of design principles corresponds to the success in all other criteria, except for the measure of using typographic items, which corresponds to the moderate. Employed printing techniques showed no meaningful difference according to design elements; on the other hand, the results showed significant differences in the "readability of typographic items" and "the usage of typographic items". The readability of typographic items and the use of typographic items are more successful than linoleum printing in studies obtained in computer-aided design. No statistically significant difference was found in other design principles according to the printing type. It is considered that the results are essential in creating awareness in general and drawing attention to the design shortcomings of the students studying in the art teaching department.

Makale Başlığı: A Sartrean Analysis of Endgame Under the Light of Sartre's Concept of Being-for-Others
Özet: The idea that existence is a kind of anguish is expressed by French author, Jean Paul Sartre whose existentialist philosophy can be associated with Beckett’s plays in which characters are substantially in need of one another to realize their existence. For example, in Beckett’s Endgame, the fact that each character needs the other as his mirror to prove his existence can be discussed with reference to Sartre’s book, Being and Nothingness, in which Sartre puts forward the concept of ‘being for others’ in order to clarify the problem of ‘the existence of the Other’. However, there is also another aspect of being-for-others concept, that is, making object the other of one’s gaze. This is inevitably resulted in conflicts in relationships which are based on interests. Sartre suggests that one should be aware of the fact that the other is also a free consciousness just like the one who looks at the other. Then, the relationships between individuals turn into one that include mutual respect and understanding. In these sorts of relationships, people can become the mirrors of each other and help each other in realizing their existence.

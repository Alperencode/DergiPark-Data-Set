Makale Başlığı: A Group of Knidian Aphrodit-Type Terracotta Figurines from Mysia.
Özet: This paper aims to describe four Knidian Aphrodite-type terracotta figurines listed on the inventory of the Bandirma Archaeological Museum. It is understandable from the used material and the observed variety that the works exhibit the stylistic features of the nude sculpture of Knidian Aphrodite, created by the sculptor Praxiteles in the 4th century BC. The figurines support the assumption that they cannot be standard productions as evident from the considerable stylistic diversity of such figurines. Although the set provides no new typology of coroplastic works of the respective period, it contributes to the literature on the artistic perception in the region. The collection, evidencing the regional identicalness of artistic aesthetics, reveals the cultural associations of Mysia with the contemporary regions and cities. Factoring in the fact that the works of this unsophisticated style typically occurred between the end of the 1st century BC and the end of the 1st century AD, their analogy with their likes in different cities and regions suggests that they too can be dated to this period. Besides, the detailed stylistic and typological analyses showed that the figurine K4 can be dated back to the first half of the 1st century AD and K1-3 to the second half.

Makale Başlığı: Interpretation Of Ibsen’s Nora - A Doll House With Monomite Theory
Özet: As a result of Joseph Campbell's categorization on myths in The Hero's Endless Journey, it is seen that myths occur in certain stages. Although not all these stages are seen in every myth, there are similarities in general terms. Campbell called this categorization "Monomite". “Monomite” consists of three basic stages. These stages are: “Separation, Initiation and Return”. When the transformation of the character of Henrik Ibsen’s Nora, the protagonist of the play Nora - A Doll's House, is examined through the formula named "Monomite" by Joseph Campbell, it is seen that the formula is also valid for this play. While the events in the play are examined with the "Monomite" formula, the characters will be handled through Jung's archetypes. Because the formula, which is the categorized form of myths, is also related to archetypes. When the role of Nora, and the other characters around her in "Monomite" are examined, it is clearly seen how "Monomite" corresponds to the transformation of the hero as a working formula in the play Nora - A Doll's House. When the game's equivalents of "Separation, Initiation and Return", which are the sub-stages of the "Monomite" categorization, are examined, the consciousness change that we see in the text of the play, Nora, will turn her into a pioneering women's rights defender.

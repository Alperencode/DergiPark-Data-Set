Makale Başlığı: Memory Discourse in the Turkish Contemporary Art Scene in the Late Twentieth Century
Özet: While reaching the end of twentieth century, contemporary understanding of space and time began to threaten history’s centralist, linear and causal structure. In the appearingly accelerating and tightening world, the individual feels the need for deceleration and adherence. The perspective offered by history and grand narratives can no longer be adequate for the individuum seeking a sense of identity and belonging. Therefore, the individual clings to his/her verity and thereby his/her memory. In the Turkish contemporary art scene in the late twentieth century, memory became a prevalent discourse as a result of its intersection and overlapping with the contemporary conception of time and space structurally, in their diverse, elusive, inconceivable, multi-dimesional, inter-textual, atemporal, nonlinear, ephemeral, equivocal and paradoxical characteristics. Furthermore, memory works as a language and a manner of expression that contemporary artists of the period put into practice in their art. The deficiencies of memory became its power which response to the zeitgeist of the era and to the search of those artists who express themselves only with the subtle forms of memory.

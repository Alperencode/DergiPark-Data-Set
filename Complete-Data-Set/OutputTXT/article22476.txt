Makale Başlığı: THE PROBLEM OF REFLECTING THE STYLE OF THE SOURCE WORK INTO THE TRANSLATION WORK
Özet: Reflecting the style of the source work to the translation as much as possible is one of the biggest challenges facing the translator. So much so that even a work written in a very simple style can cause complex problems in translation. Because the translator's style is inevitably reflected in the translation work. In this article, the stylistic issue of the translated work is discussed. As a sample text, Shamolli Kecha story by one of the well-known representatives of contemporary Uzbek literature, Isajon Sulton, was chosen and analyzed by comparing its Turkish translation with the Windy Night. Isajon Sulton is one of the Uzbek writers of the independence period who writes in a simple and understandable language. His story Shamolli Kecha is written in a simple style like his other works. Although the translation of the story into Turkey Turkish was successful, there are some issues that the translator overlooked. In this article, the points that escaped the translator's eyes were determined and examples were given about how to translate those parts. In the article, information is given about what should be considered when translating literary texts. It is hoped that the result of the study will shed light on the possible problems to be encountered in literary translations from Uzbek Turkish to Turkey Turkish.

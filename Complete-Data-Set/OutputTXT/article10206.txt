Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Received Occupational Safety Measures in Coal Mines
Özet: The mining industry is distinguished from other professions by being a dangerous profession with heavy working conditions. Due to the fact that the employee load and the hazards are high in parallel, it is very important in this sector to determine the hazards in advance and to create risk analyzes. In order to prevent mining accidents by ensuring the occupational health and safety of the employees, the risks should be determined and the precautions to be taken by risk analysis and assessment should be determined.  In this study, taking into account the mine accidents in two coal mines, the measures taken to ensure occupational safety and the precautions taken to prevent explosion and firepit accidents were evaluated by applying a survey to the mine workers. When the survey results are evaluated, it has been determined that there is not sufficient occupational safety in the mining workplaces, that the employees do not have sufficient knowledge and training about the work they do, that the measurement and results of the firedamp in the mine sites are not in accordance with the occupational safety regulations.

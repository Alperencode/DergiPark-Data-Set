Makale Başlığı: The Formation of the Najjāriyya and Their Theology
Özet: The regions of Khorāsān and its environs had witnessed a great intellectual renaissance in various fields, whether in Islamic theology, jurisprudence, or other disciplines. Starting from the era of al-Ma'mūn, the Mu’tazilites emerged as a sect representing the authority. The Ṭāhirid State was established as a pro-Ma'mūn state in Khorāsān and helped to consolidate such a renaissance. The aforementioned regions had witnessed a lot of theological sects and many adherents of Islamic schools of thought. There were many debates and discussions among all these sects, especially during the notorious ordeal of the Creation of the Qur'an, which was spearheaded by the Mu'tazilites who forced people to adhere to their belief. The Najjārī Sect emerged from the womb of the Mu'tazila, the founder of the Sect, Al-Hussein bin Muhammad Al-Najjār, was described by sources as one of the greatest theologians as he was a student of the famous Mu'tazilite Bishr Al-Marīsī. Afterwards, Al-Najjār formed a new doctrine, in which he combined many opinions from different theological schools of Islamic thought. More than ten sects have emerged from the Najjārī Sect; the most famous of which are the Borghoūthis, the Mustadrikas and the Za’farānis. This paper aims to shed light on the Najjārī Sect by providing a brief on the city of Ray as it was the hub of activity for the main sects of the Najjārīs. In addition, a synopsis of the theological opinions of the Najjārī sects shall be presented based on books of discourses (Maqālāt) and Islamic sects.

Makale Başlığı: Work Alienation and Organizational Justice
Özet: Based on affective events, self-determination and associative network theories, this study which aims to investigate the relationship between work alienation and organizational justice perception, claims that alienated individuals would be in negative mood as they can’t fulfill their autonomy and competency needs which in turn it may affect their justice perception negatively. The data, which were gathered from 230 employees, indicate that work alienation predicted distributive, procedural and interactional justice negatively. Furthermore powerlessness, the sub-dimension of alienation, became the strongest predictor. Another important finding is that powerlessness predicted interactional justice most. The results were discussed especially on powerlessness dimension and suggestions were given.

Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND ADVERTISING DISCUSSIONS IN JOURNALISM THROUGH INDIVIDUAL JOURNALISTS’ EFFORTS OF CREATING A REVENUE MODEL ON SOCIAL MEDIA
Özet: The relationship between news and advertising has become a subject of discussion in alternative media with the development of communication technologies, as in traditional mass media. Especially, journalists who leave mainstream media organizations or cannot find a job in these channels prefer to work on social media platforms and use advertisements as a source of income in these areas. With the development of new media platforms, the study seeks an answer to whether it is feasible for individual journalists who carry out journalism activities in these areas to incorporate advertising into income models regarding professional ethics. For this purpose, the importance of social media in individual journalism activities is discussed by focusing on the approaches of professional press or news organizations on the news-advertisement relationship. In addition, through in-depth interviews with the managers of institutions that play an active role in the determination of professional principles and academicians who are experts in their fields, the ethical dimension of advertising on the accounts of individual journalists using alternative media is tried to be positioned in the digital age.

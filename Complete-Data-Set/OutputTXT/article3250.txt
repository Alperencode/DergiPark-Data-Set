Makale Başlığı: Problematizing the Problem: A Cross-Cultural Study of Problems in Women's Advice Articles
Özet: In this study, the sex and relationship advice articles in locally-produced Englishlanguage women’s magazines from three different contexts, which are, Malaysia, theUS, and two Middle Eastern countries, Egypt and the UAE, were examined to explorethe kinds of problems that appear in each context. According to Machin and VanLeeuwen (2003), the problem-solution discourse schema used by several internationaleditions of Cosmopolitan is essentially a global one. We aim to investigate if this schemacan be applied to home-grown women’s magazines as well. Sex and relationship advicearticles from six home-grown English language women’s magazines (two magazinesfrom each context) were analysed. The findings reveal variations in the definitions andcontextualisation of each problem category in the three contexts. However, the overallaim of these articles is rather similar. That is, the problems that appear in thesemagazines are chosen to help women find answers to achieve certain life goals such asindependence and confidence in all three contexts.

Makale Başlığı: IDEAL PERSONALITY CREATION IN THE STORY WHERE BASAT KILLED TEPEGÖZ
Özet: Narratives form the memory of societies. Each narrative in the cultural memory is important in terms of being worthy of being remembered and told. It is these narratives that shape the collective memory. The inclusion of a narrative in the collective memory means that it has many functions about its society. The narrative that Basat Kills Tepegöz is also important enough to be included in the Dede Korkut narratives. The text is beyond the boundaries of traditional heroic narratives.The text tells the story of the ideal personality creation process with the characters Konur Koca Sarı Çoban, Tepegöz and Basat. Çoban symbolizes the consciousness of the individual. Çoban is conscious and aware. He knowingly and willingly rapes the Fairy and starts a series of events. He is not worried about this action. He escapes from the text when the Fairy says that he will give a "trust" to Çoban. After this point, the struggle begins in Çoban’s unconscious mind over Tepegöz and Basat. Tepegöz symbolizes the negative impulses of the unconscious that are not allowed by social norms, while Basat symbolizes the positive side of the unconscious that restrains these impulses. At this point, the text has been evaluated with the psychoanalytic method within the framework of Gustav Jung's “Ideal Personality Development” approach. The necessity structure of Tepegöz and Basat's creation has been resolved in terms of the roles Çoban played in the awareness process.

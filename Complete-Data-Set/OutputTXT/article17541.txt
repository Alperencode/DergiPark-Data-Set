Makale Başlığı: The Legend of Bride Stone and Dede Hill and the Miniature Design
Özet: For centuries, literature has been the most effective way for a civilization to tell and convey its cultures and traditions around the world. While the products of oral and written literature shed light on the age, they also provide an endless source for every field of art. Legends are also a type of expression that is a type of dictionary. It differs from the fairy tale type in that the narrator and the listener believe that what happened is real. Legends, which have an extraordinary and sacred side as well as the element of reality, take their source from history, religion and daily events. Legends play a major role in understanding and comprehending works in different fields of art that have been produced in every period of history. The subjects and heroes in the legends continue to be reshaped under the roof of art and to take on another identity and body. An example of this culture, which has an important place in our folklore, is the legend of Bride Stone and Dede Hill in Izmir. The miniature design of the scene in which the bridal procession turns into stone in the legend that tells the story of a young girl who helps the people of a village that have moved away from religion, and a pair who are responsible for showing the right way. It is important that the design of the model which is on the verge of disappearing, is authentic.

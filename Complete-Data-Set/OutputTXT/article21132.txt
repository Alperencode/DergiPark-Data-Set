Makale Başlığı: Measurement of Perceived Psychological Safety: Integration, Review and Evidences for the Scale in the Context of Turkiye
Özet: Psychological    safety    can    predict    many    positive    individual    and    organizational   outcomes   at   work,   and   previous   research   addressed   how  psychological  safety  contributes  to  positive  work  attitudes  and  behaviors.  In  Turkey,  there  is  quite  an  amount  of  research  showing  the  contributing   role   of   psychological   safety   perception   on   employees’   positive  performance  behaviors  and  organizational  effectiveness  and  innovativeness. However, previous research in Turkey does not adequately show the reliability and validity of the psychological safety scale, which was developed by Edmondson (1999). Based on the suggested requirement, this  study  aimed  to  investigate  the  psychological  safety  perceptions  of  individuals who work in various sectors in Turkey. The adapted version of the psychological safety scale was used to gain evidence for the reliability and validity of the instrument in Turkey. In total, 585 individuals working in  various  industries  and  from  various  occupational  groups  participated  in  the  research.  Both  exploratory  factor  analysis  and  the  confirmatory  factor analysis showed that Turkish adapted version of the psychological safety scale was valid and reliable.

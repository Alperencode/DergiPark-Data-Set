Makale Başlığı: CORONAVIRUS AND INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS VACCINES IN CHICKENS
Özet: : Enfectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious viral enfection that causes lesions in the respiratory and urogenital systems of the poultry industry, especially young and adult layers and broiler chickens, thus causing a decrease in carcass development and egg quality, and is responsible for significant economic losses. Enfectious Bronchitis was first defined as an acute respiratory disease in chickens in the United States in 1930, and the causative virus (IBV) was isolated in 1936. It was first determined in our country in 1978 in serological studies conducted in unvaccinated flocks in Ankara region, and it spread throughout the country in parallel with the rapid increase in chicken breeding in the 1980s. Commercially, IB outbreaks remain a major problem for poultry producers, even with extensive vaccination. New serotypes and variants are constantly appearing, forcing poultry producers and animal health companies to constantly evaluate vaccination plans and produce new vaccines.

Makale Başlığı: Dobrudja Tatars Origin of "Bayböri Ulı Beyrek Batır" and "Kitab-i Dede Korkut" Epics from the Same Source
Özet: Prohibited in the former Soviet Union in the 1950s, the epic stories in a collection called "The Book of Dede Korkut", a common epos of the Turkic world, are identical or similar to the best examples of the oral literature of many Turkic peoples, regardless of the region in which they live. Dobruca region, which is within the borders of Romania and Bulgaria today, has been one of the settlement and development areas of Turkish culture in history and today. Anatolia, Azerbaijan and Central Asia gain weight among the spreading areas of Dede Korkut Epic, which is one of the most important works of Turkish World Folk Literature. However, the Balkans is the geog-raphy where the least information is known among the spreading areas of the epic in question and the regions where it became variants.One of them is the epic of the Dobrujan Tatars "Baybori Uli Beyrek Batyr". Comparing the stories in both epics and the heroes of the dastans, it can be concluded that they are the variations of the same epos. In this study, evaluations were made within the framework of the remarkable similarities on the two epics in question and some determinations were made about the epic features.

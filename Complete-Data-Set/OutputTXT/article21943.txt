Makale Başlığı: Traditions of birth, wedding and death of the Kazakhs
Özet: Tradition is the whole of cultural signs, addictions, knowledge, customs and behaviors that have survived from ancient times in any society or community, valued and passed on from generation to generation, with the power of sanction. There are certain characteristics that distinguish a society from other societies. These features are largely known as the cultural identity of the society. This identity of the society is based on what the society has lived and experienced throughout history. The Turkish nation, which is known for its customs and traditions, beliefs and practices, lifestyles, clothing, continues its existence by continuing these riches from generation to generation.For the Kazakhs, who led a nomadic lifestyle for many years, the birth of a child and his upbringing is very significant and has survived to this day. Celebrations starting from the first birth of the child, wedding and death ceremonies, which are one of the most important traditions of the society, are among the life values of the Kazakh society. This study examined the ceremonies performed at birth and after the birth of a child, as well as the rites of marriage and death in the context of the Kazakh family structure. In this respect, the ceremonies held in the Kazakh family have also been determined in terms of adhering to the traditions within the moral rules of the society.

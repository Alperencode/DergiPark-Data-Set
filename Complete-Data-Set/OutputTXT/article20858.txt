Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Digital Stories on Primary School Students' Listening Comprehension Skills
Özet: The purpose of this research is to determine the effect of digital stories on the listening comprehension skills of primary school 4th grade students. For this purpose, the research has carried out with a quasi-experimental design with pre-test post-test control group. The sample of the research consisted of 52 students studying in two different 4th grade branches of a public primary school in the second semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. The stories transferred to digital in the research have selected from the texts in 3 different Turkish textbooks at the 4th grade level of primary school published by the Ministry of National Education and taught to students in previous years. 8 narrative texts from the themes of "My Beautiful Country Turkey" and "Production, Consumption and Efficiency" in the textbooks have converted into digital through digital design programs. During the implementation process, the animations of 8 stories transferred to digital have watched by the students in the experimental group, and the students in the control group have read and listened to the same story texts by the teacher. The Listening Comprehension Test has used to determine the listening comprehension achievement scores of the students in the experimental and control groups at the beginning and end of the application process. As a result of the research, it has determined that there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test achievement scores of the students in the experimental group, where the stories have played digitally.

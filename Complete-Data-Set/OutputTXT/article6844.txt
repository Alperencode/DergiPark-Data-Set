Makale Başlığı: a Holistic View on Narrations about Ṣalāt al-Nafl after the Farḍ of the Asr Ṣalāt
Özet: This study aims to find out the narrations about whether the Prophet always prayed ṣalāt al-nafl (supererogatory prayer) following the farḍ part of the afternoon ṣalāt, which is a topic containing contradictions likely to be seen in narrations on the same topic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine to what extent the narrations on this topic, reported in contradictory forms by the ṣaḥābah, are properly related to the Prophet and to identify which of the reported narrations is the one that the Prophet always practices as a Sunnah. In this way, it will be clear how to understand the contradictory narrations on whether to perform ṣalāt al-nafl following the farḍ part of the afternoon ṣalāt. As far as we know, there are different narrations (on the surface) reported by the ṣaḥābah about whether the Prophet performed ṣalāt al-nafl following the farḍ part of the afternoon ṣalāt. According to Aisha, who reported the narrations arguing that the Prophet performed ṣalāt al-nafl following the farḍ part of the afternoon ṣalāt, the Prophet always performed and never abandoned this ṣalāt. Also, when she was told about the narration reporting a ḥadīth contrary to this fact, she stated that those narrators were wrong. However, it is seen that in several narrations ṣaḥābah stated that the Prophet did not perform ṣalāt during this period and he actually prohibited performing ṣalāt during this period, which is contrary to the report of Aisha. They also criticized Aisha due to this report she made. It must be immediately stated that the aim of criticism the ṣaḥābah made is to ensure the ḥadīths to be reported truthfully.

Makale Başlığı: USE OF SPORTS AS A POLITICAL ELEMENT BY LEADERS
Özet: Although it seems like they are different fields from each other, sports and politics try to reach the same goals with different methods. That is, both are motivated by factors such as attaining power, maintaining power, and gaining control through power. The physical popularity of athletes and the social and economic dimensions of sports have always been in the interest of political leaders, and there have always been ambitions to gain political power over the masses through sports. Because, not only the concept of power, but also the fact that both schools have common goals such as influencing the masses and staying on the agenda all the time, inevitably has left sports and politics in close contact with each other at all times.In this study, qualitative and literature research methods have been applied, focusing on how sports are used as a tool of manipulation and control by different geographies, different leaders and different ideologies in the historical process as a political factor, and the dimensions of the relationship between sports and politics will be discussed.

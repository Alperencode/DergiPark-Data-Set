Özet: Objective: In this study, it was aimed to determine the eating behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to evaluate their body weights according to age, and determine the problems experienced by the families regarding the nutrition of their children. Method: The sample of this descriptive and study consisted of 80 different 3parents with a child diagnosed with ASD who received service from a private psychiatry-psychotherapy center. In this study, which was carried out with the principle of voluntariness, no sampling was made, and all families who agreed to participate in the study were included in the study. The data were collected with a questionnaire developed by the researchers between April and May 2021. All necessary permissions were obtained before the research. In the evaluation of the data, Sperman correlation coefficient and Fisher's Exact tests were used as well as descriptive statistical methods.Results: The youngest of the children participating in the study was 3 years old, and the oldest was 13 years old. The mean age at diagnosis of ASD was found to be 3.28±1.10 years. While 55.70% of the children had a fear of tasting new foods (neophobia), it was determined that 55.70% were not open to new tastes. The rate of children with food selectivity was 54.43% and the rate of children with beverage selectivity was 32.91%. When the percentile value of the body mass index (BMI) according to age is examined, 42.5% of the children are >95th percentile (obese), 17.5% are >85th percentile (overweight/obese), and 10% are 50th percentile (normal weight) and 23.8 were found to be <50th percentile (under normal weight). When the relationship between being open to new tastes and food rejection was examined, 72.7% of those who were open to new tastes and 84.5% of those who were not open to new tastes had food rejection. The rate of children with food selectivity was 54.43% and the rate of children with beverage selectivity was 32.91%. When the relationship between openness to new tastes and food selectivity was examined, 40.9% of those who were open to new tastes and 75.9% of those who were not open to new tastes had food selectivity. It was determined that there was a significant relationship between being open to new tastes and food selectivity (p<0.05). It was found that there was a moderately significant inverse relationship between the education level of the mother and the degree of obesity of the child (r= -0.53 p=0.042), and there was no significant correlation between the education level of the father and the degree of obesity of the child (r=0.02 p=0.863).Conclusion: Parents of children with autism are concerned that the nutritional problem may lead to malnutrition, and therefore they try to intensify the effectiveness of their nutrition initiatives. Since the diets of children with autism and their consequences have not yet been fully understood and clarified, further studies are needed to include the process of shaping the eating habits of these children, their eating behaviors, and the effects of the diet on their daily eating habits and the formation of food selectivity.

Makale Başlığı: The Correlation Between Mother-Infant Bonding and Postpartum Depression in Women with A History of Infertility
Özet: Purpose: This study investigated the correlation between mother-infant bonding and postpartum depression in women with a history of infertility.Methods: The sample consisted of 169 women divided into two: infertile group (n=56) and fertile group (n=112). Data were collected using a descriptive information questionnaire, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS).Results: The fertile and infertile groups had a mean age of 28.95±3.38 and 36.55±3.55, respectively (p=0.001). The infertile group had a higher mean MIBS score (3.73±2.91) than the fertile group (1.50±1.29) (p=0.001). However, there was no significant difference in EPDS scores between the two groups (p > 0.05). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between MIBS and EPDS score in the fertile group (r = 0.354, p = 0.001), suggesting that the higher the risk for postpartum depression, the lower the mother-infant bonding. There was no correlation between MIBS and EPDS score in the infertile group (p > 0.05).Conclusion: Future studies should recruit larger samples of infertile women with cultural and ethnic diversity and take confounding factors into account to investigate the relationship between postpartum depression and mother-infant bonding.

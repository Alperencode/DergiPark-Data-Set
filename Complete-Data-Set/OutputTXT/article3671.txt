Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Evaluation of the Development of the Sheriff's Office in Medieval England
Özet: In our study, the origins and development process of the sheriff's office in Medieval England, which is seen in many English-speaking countries, has been investigated. For this purpose, the formation of the institution from the period of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms has been studied.  Afterwards, the expansion and contraction of its powers were discussed. The relationship of the sheriff's office with various officials such as gerefa, reeve, count, viscount, aldermen has been analyzed. In addition, their processes of having security, judicial and executive powers in the provinces, and then their loss of some of these powers were examined. It has been determined that they cause some problems, especially in financial matters, while making the king's job facilitate. On the other hand, they drew the reaction of the noble class as a means of centralizing the king in the provinces. For this reason, it has been seen that most of the reform studies include provision related to them.  For all these evaluations, some examples from period sources such as Henry of Huntingdon and Roger of Howden were used.  Afterwards, modern researchers who made important studies in this field, especially William Stubbs, F. W. Maitland, William A. Morris, Judith Green and Keith Feiling, were used.  In addition, comparisons were made with the viscount in the Continent, which has similar functions with the sheriff, and the kadi in the Islamic world.  For this purpose, some of the opinions of Nizamü'l-Mülk and Imam Maverdi on the institution of kadi have been conveyed.

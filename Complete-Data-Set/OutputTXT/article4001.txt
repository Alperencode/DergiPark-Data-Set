Makale Başlığı: Effect of Turbulence Intensity on Transition Location Estimation Using Local Correlation Transition Model
Özet: Aerodynamic parameters are among the most important parameters in flight performance analyses of air/sea vehicles. Free stream turbulence intensity has significant importance on aerodynamic parameters obtained with computational fluid dynamic analyses and wind tunnel tests measurements. In this study, the effect of free stream turbulence intensity on the transition locations of spheroid geometry using with the widely accepted local correlation transition model. The computations are performed at 6.5 x 106 Reynolds number with 0 and 5 degree angle of attacks. The computations at 5 degree angle of attack are compared with an available experimental study. The effect of free stream turbulence intensity is investigated with axial force coefficient, normal force coefficient, and surface friction coefficient distributions. It is seen that axial and normal force coefficients increase with increasing free stream turbulence intensity. The differences in force coefficients obtained with the free stream intensity range used in the study shall create noteworthy effects in flight performance analyses. When surface friction coefficients are investigated, the transition model estimates the transition locations earlier while free stream turbulence intensity increases as expected. However, the transition front geometry is obtained significantly different with respect to the experimental results.

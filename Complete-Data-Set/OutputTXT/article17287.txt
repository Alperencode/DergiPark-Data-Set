Makale Başlığı: STRUCTURE OF GLOBAL BANANA MARKET
Özet: Crucial developments have been experienced in the production, foreign trade and the market of banana that ranks 4th in terms of agricultural production in the world. In the 1990-2019 period the production of banana increased by 2.34-fold and reached to 116.78 million tonnes, import increased by 4.22-fold and reached to 13.53 billion Dollars as of 2019. Banana production concentrates in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and India (26.08%), China (10.27%), Indonesia (6.23%) and Brazil (5.83%) are among top producer countries. Ecuador (23.55%), Philippines (14.44%), Costa Rica (7.38%) and Colombia (6.44%) are among top exporter countries. In terms of imports, USA ranks first with a 20.34% ratio. Although 4 multinational firms (Dole Food, Chiquita, Fresh DelMonte and Fyffes) traditionally dominate global banana trade, the market shares of these firms have decreased significantly. While market shares of these firms (CR4) had been 62%, it decreased to 45% as of 2017. In the study, the reasons of the change are aimed to be explored and the most important reason is determined to be the increase in the number of firms in the market after technological improvements in banana transportation. Consequently, chain stores started to import by themselves of from other importer firms. Following these developments global banana foreign trade market structure has altered form a strong oligopoly to a moderate oligopoly in the last 20 years.

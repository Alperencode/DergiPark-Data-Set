Makale Başlığı: The Healing Effect of Resveratrol and Platelet Rich Plasma in Corrosive Esophagitis Model in Rats
Özet: Background: Corrosive esophageal burns have high morbidity and mortality. The effective treatment is controversial. In our study, we aimed to examine the effects of resveratrol (RSV) and platelet rich plasma (PRP) on healing in the corrosive esophagitis model in rats. Material and methods: A total of 24 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups each as esophagitis, control, PRP and RSV groups. No treatment was administered to the control group. The esophagitis model was induced in the esophagitis and treatment groups. The esophagitis group was not treated. PRP group was treated with PRP, RSV group was treated with RSV. Pathological and biochemical examinations were performed from distal esophagitis. Results: The highest tissue IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were observed in the esophagitis group. The lowest tissue IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were noted in the control group. The highest tissue TAS levels were observed in the control group. The lowest tissue TAS levels were noted in the esophagitis group. The other groups had significantly lower mean tissue TOS and OSI levels than the esophagitis group (P<0.05). Conclusions: PRP and RSV have a healing effect on esophagitis. We are of the opinion that it may be included in clinical practice over time if the dose and duration of treatment can be adjusted better for RSV.

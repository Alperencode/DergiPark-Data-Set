Makale Başlığı: Building of Travel Experience in the Cyber-Public Space:  Re-Interpreting Through Neuro-Communication
Özet: It does not go unnoticed that the transformation of travelling experience and the construction of new travelling experiences have been redefined through social networks, especially in cyber public spaces, and that this recipe has become more widespread and frothed up by the photos produced by social network users through their own visibility. In order to put the subject of the study in a strong context and evaluate it from an inclusive, holistic perspective; the first part will create an understanding through cyber publicity and social networks presented as a new field of experience. The second part, which is the continuation of the first part, will combine the concept of visibility with the travel experience and discuss it from the axis of the “happiness industry”. In the last part, the neuro-communication pattern of being visible will be evaluated in order to create a new understanding on sociological foundations. The main argument put forward in the study will be evaluated from a critical perspective theoretically through the theoretical literature, based on the media-communication-tourism grounding of the relationship between cyber publicity-visibility-travel experience and by considering them in the context of sociology, social psychology, communication psychology and also neuro-science/brain science perspective.

Makale Başlığı: Post-COVID corticosteroid use and pulmonary fibrosis: 1 year follow-up
Özet: Purpose: Depending on the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 disease, pulmonary sequelae and fibrotic lung disease continue to pose significant problems for patients in the post-COVID period. In our study, we aimed to determine the risk factors for pulmonary sequelae and fibrosis with post-COVID patient management.Materials and Methods: The study comprised 67 post-COVID patients who were released from the hospital after receiving low-dose corticosteroids (0.5 mg/kg daily methylprednisolone) as a result of COVID-19. Socio-demographic data, radiological and laboratory findings of the patients were recorded. All patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge, and the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis was made according to high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings, by evaluating with detailed biochemical blood tests and HRCT.Results: Thirtyfour (50.7%) of the 67 patients were male and the mean age was 57±16.33 (min.19–max.90). At 3 months, there were 59 patients (88.1%) with aberrant thoracic computed tomography (CT) findings, 28 (41.8%) at 6 months, and 21 (31.3%) at 12 months. In the 12th month follow-up, pulmonary fibrosis was detected in a total of 9 (13.4%) patients according to thorax CT findings. Conclusion: In our study, the most important risk factors for the development of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis were intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up, lymphocyte count <500 and ferritin ≥300. For this reason, patients who are treated in the ICU, especially in the hospital, should be followed up regularly and frequently after discharge.

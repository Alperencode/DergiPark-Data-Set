Makale Başlığı: January – May 2022 a Review on Turkish – British Relations in Various Fields
Özet: The Turkish-British representations relationship, which was established after the British Empire appointed William Harborne as ambassador to the Bab-ı Ali in 1583, improved itself day by day and ensured that the ties between the two countries remained firmly connected throughout history. As a result of the said cooperation, it is seen that the representations of both countries in each other’s territory carry out activities in various fields. This study presents the diplomatic activities in Turkish - British relations between January - May 2022, taking the Turkish Embassy in London in the centre, and the activities of the Turkish authorities in the United Kingdom, with reference to mainly Turkey's official embassy statements.

Makale Başlığı: STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF ASEAN ORGANIZATION
Özet: ASEAN is an economic organization established by several Southeastern Asia countries. Today, Asia has gradually increased its importance regarding power struggles in international relations. Thanks to its economic dynamism, population, and production power, many countries have boosted their activities towards the region. ASEAN, which is constituted of the region's major players, has risen to prominence in recent years. Many countries, primarily the United States and China, pursue new strategies to gain more influence in each ASEAN member country by ASEAN reality. For this reason, understanding ASEAN's goals and learning about its political structure and decision-making mechanisms play a vital role in future governance. The purpose of this essay is to use PESTEL analysis to understand the nature of ASEAN better.

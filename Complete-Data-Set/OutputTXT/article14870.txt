Makale Başlığı: Energy Saving in Ring Spinning: Use of Lighter Tube
Özet: Energy saving has a great importance in the textile industry as in every field. In this study, the energy savings achieved by using lighter tube in ring spinning machines were examined under spinning mill conditions. Light tube produced by using lower density composites and with thinner wall thickness provides significant energy saving. Another advantage is ability of winding more yarn on the same size tube thanks to thinner wall thickness. As a result of the comparative energy analysis over 1000 hours; Energy saving up to 33.5 MWh/year/machine was found possible with the use of lighter tubes. With the contribution of the advantage of being able to wind more yarn on the tube, the total savings can reach 1825 USD/machine/year.

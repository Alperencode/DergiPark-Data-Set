Makale Başlığı: An Introduction to Kitapçı Karabet Efendi’s Contributions to Ottoman Printing
Özet: Ottoman-Armenian bookseller, publisher, and printer Karabet Keşişyan Efendi (Garabed Keshishian, 1850–1911), is an influential name among the Armenians who left important marks in the history of Ottoman printing. As a prolific and enterprising figure, he was one of the most famous printers of the Hamidian Era (1876–1909). His contributions in this field reflect the sociocultural changes that occurred gradually in the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century. Thanks to his prudent relations with the Ottoman center and his privileged position, he is distinguished from his peers. He was the book supplier of Turkish military and civil schools. His printing house published mostly Turkish language textbooks and became the sole provider for the Turkish military and civil schools from 1889 until the beginning of the twentieth century. He was decorated with many international awards as well as the orders of the Mecidiye and the Osmaniye. Despite these unique features, he was not subjected to a comprehensive research, and his contributions to Ottoman printing as well as his book catalogues were not studied. This research aims to fill this gap in the literature by unearthing his printing activities through quantitative data, exploring his methods of work and connections with his circles.

Makale Başlığı: A DIALECTICAL METAPHOR ON THE MARVELOUS SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE BLOOD-BRAIN AND THE RIVER-LAND BARRIERS
Özet: Blood-brain barrier; It consists of blood vessels and glia cells of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid around the vessels, and peace-fight cells located at these distances (A Prat, Glia. 2001). This structure, which provides the balance of the central nervous system between life and death, not only refuses to interfere with the private world of the brain, but also prevents the brain's declaration of eternal freedom.The blood-brain barrier primarily tries diplomacy through the neural circuits it contains in the protection of the software and hardware of the brain. If this is not successful; Due to the cerebrospinal fluid it contains, it uses the strategies of sea, land with astrocytes, and air wars with the molecules it produces. In terms of its structure and functions, the blood-brain barrier is similar to the rivers that give life to the earth and maintain its balance. River beds are like arteries and veins, plants and trees on riverbanks are like glia cells, aquatic creatures living in rivers are blood cells, birds are neurotransmitters, and the sounds and smells of rivers resemble electrical currents used in nerve transmissions. The deterioration of blood-brain barriers in all living things, including humans, cannot sufficiently disrupt the river-soil barrier, perhaps due to the mercy of the rivers. But the disruption of the river-soil barrier can completely destroy the blood-brain barrier in living things and turn the Earth into Mars.

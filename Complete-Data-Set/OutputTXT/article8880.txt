Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the effects of mesenchymal stem cell administration on liver recovery in experimental hepatotoxicity model
Özet: Hepatotoxicity refers to liver dysfunction associated with certain medical drugs and chemicals. Studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells have a positive effect on the improvement of liver diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective effects of fetal kidney-induced mesenchymal stem cells on Doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Sprague dawley rats were divided into three groups as control, sham, and treatment group. Intraperitoneal mesenchymal stem cells were treated with BrdU prior to transplantation so that they could be followed up after invivo transplantation. After completion of the experimental steps, the groups were monitored for 5 weeks. Then the rats were terminated and their livers were taken for histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. In immunohistochemical examinations performed with TNF-α, Caspase-3 and COX-2 primary antibodies, the most severe positivity was in the sham group, followed by the control and treatment groups. While the control and sham groups were found to be statistically similar in immunohistochemical staining with anti-BrdU antibody, the treatment group was found to be significantly different from the other groups (p<0.05).As a result, it has been revealed that mesenchymal stem cells administered intraperitoneally to rats with Doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity, prevent degeneration and necrosis in hepatocytes, and TNF-α, COX-2, and Caspase-3 levels were significantly decreased immunohistochemically, proving increased liver regeneration.

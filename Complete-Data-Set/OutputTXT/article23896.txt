Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF NUTRITION ON PROTECTION AGAINST DEMENTIA: THE NEURODEGENERATIVE DELAY INTERVENTION DIET
Özet: Rates of age-related diseases such as dementia are increasing every year. Preservation of membrane structure and function is important in preventing neurodegeneration and supporting optimal brain function during aging. It has been observed that the synergistic effect of different dietary micronutrient classes provides a more synergistic contribution to support membrane structure and function than exercise and stress reduction. Dietary micronutrients have been studied to maintain membrane fluidity and prevent chronic inflammation, focusing on membrane-soluble components (zeaxanthin, lutein, vitamin E, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and water-soluble components (vitamin C and various phenolics) acting synergistically, and their beneficial effects are seen. The MIND diet is a diet that emerged for this purpose. It was created as a result of the modification of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). In this review, the content of the MIND diet and its relationship with various diseases are included.

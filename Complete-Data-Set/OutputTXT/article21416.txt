Makale Başlığı: An alternative method of biomedical signal transmission through the GSM voice channel
Özet: In this work, a new solution for online and accurate biomedical data transmission is presented. For this  purpose, a global system for mobile  GSM  communication voice channel is, for the first time, used as a communication  link between the patient and healthcare provider. Biomedical signals are converted into speech-like signals before being  transferred over a GSM voice channel. On the receiver side, speech-like symbols are stored in a symbols bank, and  constructed using random stochastic signals. On the receiver end, the index of the symbol with the most similarity to  the received signal is selected as the identified sample. This method enables us to communicate with an accuracy of 99.8%  at a transfer rate of 110 samples per second and signal-to-noise ratio  SNR  of 10. By utilizing a GSM voice channel,  any voice channel, such as a cell phone, can be used for data transmission. The transmitted signal is encoded; therefore,  the connection is secured. GSM technology has benefits such as availability, reliability, and robustness. Additionally,  GSM can be used as a backup or service for transmitting vital physiological signals in emergency situations  e.g. in an  ambulance . This technology can also be used to transmit other physiological signals as well as nonphysiological generic  data.

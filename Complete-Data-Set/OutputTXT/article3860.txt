Makale Başlığı: Being the ‘Other’ themselves, Imam-Hatip Graduates’ Perception and Attitudes Towards the ‘Other’
Özet: In this study, the forms of othering that Imam Hatip graduates are exposed to and its effect  on their emotional and thought structures in later stages in life are discussed. In addition, as an “other” the view of Imam Hatip graduates towards the other and their views on the culture of living together are also investigated.  Purpose of the study is to determine how Imam Hatip graduates evaluate the forms of othering they are exposed to in education and business life and to reveal their attitudes towards the “other”. Qualitative research method was used in the study and 15 people were interviewed with semi-structured interview technique. Sample group, consists of Imam Hatip graduates who study at a university level or work. It was seen that the participants in general felt like an “other” due to the othering attitudes they dealt with, however, they act with the awareness of having an Imam Hatip identity. It has been understood that Imam Hatip graduates do not have an othering attitude towards various groups in society, since they entertain a culture of living together as a result of the value-based education they received at Imam Hatip high school. At the end of the study, suggestions were presented for enhancing the culture of living together in the society.

Makale Başlığı: Trends of Stomach Cancer with Joinpoint Regression in Turkey
Özet: Background: Cancer has been one of the most significant health problems in recent years. Stomach cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide with 1.09 million new cases in 2020, according to data published by the WHO (World Health Organization). A significant decrease has occurred in the number of individuals diagnosed with stomach cancer following the identification of many foods that may increase the risk of developing the disease. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the trends and change points related to new cases and numbers of deaths related to stomach cancer.Material and methods: The aim of the study was to make a time-dependent evaluation of the decreasing trend for stomach cancer in Turkey. For this purpose, change points of stomach cancer were determined with Joinpoint Regression method. The data in the study were obtained between 1990–2016. Results: The trend changes for new cases and deaths in both women and men were found to be statistically significant between 1990–2016.For women, a decrease in new cases of 2.6% was determined, while for men the decrease was 2.4%.A significant 3.2% decrease was observed in the number of deaths for women during the same period with a decrease of 2.4% for men (for all p<0.001). Conclusions: The trends relating to stomach cancer were demonstrated in the study. Examining these annual trends will assist in taking relevant precautions regarding stomach cancer. The reductions revealed in the change points can be evaluated by the researchers and precautions can be taken to reduce the risk of the disease.

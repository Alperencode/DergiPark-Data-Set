Makale Başlığı: Dye Removal from Aqueous Solutions Using Natural and Biochar Butt: Full Factorial Design Approach
Özet: High concentrations of dye-containing wastewater are generated from industries that produce intense dyes, such as textiles. These wastewaters cause serious environmental and human health problems when they are discharged into natural environments without adequate treatment. Adsorption is a frequently used, effective, and easy method to prevent this situation. However, commercial activated carbon, which is used as an adsorbent material, is often needed to be regenerated, and, this creates economic problems. This study investigated the usability of cigarette butts as an inexpensive alternative to commercial activated carbon. Cigarette butts in natural and biochar forms were used to remove malachite green dyestuff. 23 full factorial modeling was used to model the adsorption efficiency. Because of this modeling, the parameters that have the main effect on adsorption have been revealed. In the experiments, 3 factors were examined at 2 levels. These are, adsorbent amount (0.005 g/30 mL and 0.1 g/30 mL), initial dye concentration (50 mg/L and 500 mg/L), and adsorbent type (natural and biochar butts). The dyestuff removal efficiency was obtained in the study, up to 96%. According to the results of the model graphics, the factor that has the most effect on adsorption is the adsorbent type. The biochar form gave very high efficiency results compared to the natural form. It was seen that the adsorbent dose was the factor with the lowest effect on the adsorption efficiency.

Makale Başlığı: Bacteriological evaluation of vaginal discharges in heifers
Özet: Reproductive disorders in cows are the main determinant of reduced reproductive efficiency. Reproductive system infections are the most important cause of economic losses in milk production in our country as in the world. Bacterial agents are responsible for most of the infection-induced infertility. This study was carried out in 3 groups of 56 Holstein heifers. Group were as follows; Group 1: 12 (21.4%) heifers with turbid and purulent cherries, Group II: repeat breeder (non-breeding) 9 (16.1%) heifers, Group III; 35 inseminated (62.5%) heifers with normal chervil discharge. It is aimed to detect the bacteria colonizing the vagina of heifers in the study groups and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility in the dominant bacterial groups. Eighty-two bacteria were determined from the vaginal discharges of the heifers included in the study group. Twenty-six (31.7%) Escherichia coli, 10 (12.2%) Staphylococcus aureus, 9 (11.1%) Streptococcus uberis, 7 (8.5%) Staphylococcus epidermidis, 5 (6.1%) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 10 (%) 30,4) different bacteria were isolated. Susceptibility of 8 antibiotics against Escherchia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia causing fertility in cows, were examined by antibiogram. As a result, although the bacteria isolated from heifers differed among the groups, it was determined that Escherichia coli was the most dominant bacteria and gentamicin and ceftiofur exhibited 100% antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli.

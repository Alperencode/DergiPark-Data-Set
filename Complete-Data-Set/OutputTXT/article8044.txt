Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of the Applicability of the Right to Participate as a Right to the City: Segmenler Park Protocol
Özet: With the development of urban areas, large and functional urban parks have been designed that appeal to all individuals regardless of age, gender and occupation. Segmenler Park can be given as an example of urban parks located in the city center. In order to revitalize this park, Ankara Metropolitan Municipality signed a protocol with Gazi University during the Murat Karayalçın period. This protocol, signed between the university and the municipality, has questioned the fact that another institution, instead of local governments, is working on the functionalization of both parks as an urban area and a place that is a natural protected area, within the scope of participation, which is a city right. In this context, first of all, the conceptual framework was drawn in the study. The protocol of Segmenler Park was examined in the study conducted with the literature research method. The histories of city parks and Segmenler Park were mentioned; Detailed information has been given by making use of the legislation on the use, maintenance and repair of these spaces. The use of the Park was evaluated in terms of legislation and the right to participate through the protocol signed later.

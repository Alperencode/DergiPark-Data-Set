Makale Başlığı: The Coalition of Average Constants In The Analysis of Unemployment Rates
Özet: In this paper, we determine the composite meaning of the unemployment rates. In economic contexts, the unemployment rates are generally defined as the total unemployment rate (T), the male unemployment rate (M), and the female unemployment rate (W). The methodology of the coalition of average constants yields a result that can be defined as the index of the coalition of average constants: impartiality, positivity, and negativity, by transforming these three ratios into two constants and just one average, around the ideal unemployment rate data proven within the scope of this research. The index value is the meaning of unemployment for a country that is subject to selection. The method's finding is as follows: for country Xi  〈i,…,n〉: if ideal unemployment rate is approached over rates in the year, then the index will have impartial rates, affirmative rates, or negative rates. To test this research, we have chosen eleven countries that have wide variation of unemployment rates by considering the collocation of unemployment rates by region in the world. In finalization point, we first constitute the economic problems triangle of these points: M (macroeconomic issues), Y (structural issues), and S (period of normality). We reach just one data of the triangle for the country with the index of the coalition of average constants (CACI) and human capital index (HCI) to determine related issues.

Makale Başlığı: Path Analysis: Predicting Psychological Performance Strategies in the Context of Athlete Identity
Özet: Research on the relationship between athlete identity and psychological performance strategies, which have common features in the theoretical framework, is limited. With an attempt to contribute new knowledge in this direction, the aim of the research is to determine the determining role of athlete identity on psychological performance strategies. For this purpose, 302 male athletes ( age=22.18±4.60) who continue their professional sports life from different team sports branches (Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Handball) voluntarily participated in the research. Personal Information Form, Athlete Identity Scale and Psychological Performance Strategies Scale created by the researchers were used as data collection tools in the study. In the analysis of the data obtained from 302 participants, firstly, the skewness and kurtosis values for the normality test, the distributions of the Q-Q graph were examined and it was determined that the data were suitable for the normal distribution. After this stage, whether there is a multicollinearity problem between the variables was examined by Pearson Product Moments Correlation analysis. Within the scope of the research, after testing the scales with first and second level Confirmatory Factor Analysis, the predictive role of athlete identity on performance strategies was examined using SEM analysis. When the findings were examined, it was determined that the identity of the athlete significantly predicted the strategies of goal setting, relaxation, negative thinking, imagery, acting, talking to oneself and emotional control, but it did not have any effect on the automaticity sub-dimension. As a result; It can be said that a high level of athlete identity has an effect on psychological performance strategies and based on these findings, more effective psychological skills training programs can be developed by researchers.

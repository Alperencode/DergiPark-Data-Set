Makale Başlığı: Examination of Effect of Impinging Jet-Cross Flow on Cooling Performance Depending on Variation of Fin Position
Özet: The cooling of electronic devices is improved by the jet effect created by the impinging jet and cross flow. In this study, heat transfer from patterned surfaces in finless and different fin spacing (N = D and 1.5D) channels with impinging jet and cross flow was numerically investigated. Numerical analysis was carried out steady state and in three dimensional by using Ansys-Fluent program with k-ε turbulence model. Three patterns were positioned in the channels, taking into account the channel sizes in the studies in the literature. The angle of the fin in the channel with the horizontal is 60o. The Re number range of both cross flow and impinging jet flow is 11000-15000. So as to prove the accuracy of the study, the results were compared with the results in the Nu number equation obtained by the experimental study in the literature and it was determined that they were quite compatible. The results of the study were analyzed as the average Nu number and the variation of the average surface temperature for each patterned surface and pattern row. In addition, velocity and temperature contour distributions were evaluated in the combined jet flow channel with both pattern surfaces at Re = 15000 and H = 3D heights, without fins and at fin positions with N = D and 1.5D distances. For all three patterned surfaces in the channel, the average Num value increased by 21.63% at 60o finned N = 1.5D distance compared to the finless condition, while this increase was 4.4% when N = D in the finned channel.

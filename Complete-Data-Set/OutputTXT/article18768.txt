Makale Başlığı: THE VALIDITY OF THE FINANCIAL KUZNETS CURVE HYPOTHESIS: THE SHORT AND LONG TERM TIME SERIES FINDINGS ON THE TURKISH ECONOMY
Özet: Two main objectives are pursued in this study. The first is to reveal the validity of the Financial Kuznets Curve hypothesis in the short and long term in the Turkish economy in the 1990-2019 sample period. The other aim is to test the hypothesis in question with FMOLS, DOLS and CCR methods besides ARDL limit test and compare the findings. Thus, the reliability of the findings obtained are revealed and policy recommendations are presented. In line with these purposes, empirical analyzes were made with the variables of financial development, per capita national income, public expenditures and Gini coefficient of the Turkish economy. Empirical findings reveal the validity of the Financial Kuznets Curve hypothesis in the short and long run. In the long-term estimation, ARDL limit test and FMOLS, DOLS and CCR findings were found to be consistent with each other. With the validity of the Financial Kuznets Curve hypothesis, it was concluded that the inverse-U relationship was valid in the Turkish economy in the said period. This result shows that it is important to turn to policies that increase financial development in order to eliminate the inequality of income distribution in Turkey.

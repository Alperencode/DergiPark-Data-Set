Makale Başlığı: Fear Of Compassion and Psychological Flexibility in Adults
Özet: Fear of compassion is one's resistance to showing compassion for oneself and others. This resistance can manifest itself in three dimensions as the fear of showing compassion for others, reciprocating compassion from others, and showing compassion for ourselves. However, individuals with psychological flexibility may feel this fear less. In this study, whether the subdimensions of psychological flexibility (values and committed action, present moment awareness, acceptance, self as context ,and defusion) were significant predictors of the subdimensions of fear of compassion (fear of compassion for others, fear of compassion from other, and  fear of self-compassion) has been examined and it was investigated whether  fear of compassion scores differed significantly according to gender and relationship status. Personal Information Form, Fears of Compassion Scales and Psychological Flexibility Scale were used to collect data. Analyzes showed that psychological flexibility was a significant predictor of fear of compassion in all subdimensions, men's fear of compassion was higher than women's, and the fear of responding to compassion from others was significantly higher in married individuals than in single individuals.

Makale Başlığı: Giovanni Aldini’s Presentation of His Fireproof Invention to the Palace
Özet: Significant progress was made in the fight against fire as a common problem of humanityin the 19th century. The impact of Italian scientist Giovanni Aldini is great on thisprogress. Aldini invented a fireproof fabric woven from asbestos together with variousmaterials for firefighters to use during a fire. Aldini, who made production and scientificpublications about this invention, had exercises done in various centers in Europe. Whilethese developments were taking place in Europe, the Ottoman Empire closed the TulumbacılarCorps together with the Janissary Corps in 1826 and left no official institution tofight the fire. Since there was no institution to fight the Hocapaşa fire that broke out onAugust 2, 1826, many state institutions, especially the Bâbıali, suffered serious damage.After introducing his invention to the European kingdoms and nobles, Giovanni Aldiniapplied to the Ottoman sultan about his fire protection inventions just after the 1826Hocapaşa fire. In this study, the letter of Aldini and the Turkish abstract of it written topresent his fireproof fabric and other products produced from asbestos to Sultan MahmudII are discussed. Despite, Aldini presenting information about his invention at a timewhen the Ottoman state needed it most, the reasons why it was not evaluated will also beexamined.

Makale Başlığı: Radiofrequency treatment in trigeminal neuralgia
Özet: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a disease characterized by paroxysmal or constant pain, which occurs when part or all of the 5th nerve (Trigeminal nerve), which provides sensation in the head and face, is affected unilaterally in our body. TN is the most common disease among cranial neuralgias. The diagnosis of TN, which negatively affects the quality of life and can cause depression from time to time, can be difficult because its symptoms are often confused with other diseases. The diagnosis of the disease is made only on the basis of symptoms. 5 out of every 100,000 people in the world are diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. When we compare this number to Turkey, 4000 people out of 80 million people in our country are diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia every year. Radiofrequency therapy, on the other hand, is a method that aims to eliminate pain by blocking the nerves that carry the sense of pain. Although drug therapy is the first choice in treatment, radiofrequency thermocoagulation is one of the most effective and low-risk methods in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, which can be preferred in cases where drug therapy is not sufficient or in patients who are not suitable for open surgery.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Postpartum Period on the Urinary Incontinence Frequency and the Quality of Life
Özet: This study aimed to determine the effect of the postpartum period on the urinary incontinence incidence and the quality of life in women giving birth in the last five years. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 358 non-pregnant women who had given birth in the last five years. The data were collected with the "Diagnostic Form" and the "Urinary Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (IQOL)". The prevalence of urinary incontinence in our population is 67.3%. Urinary incontinence was seen in 31.1% of women who had passed less than one year postpartum, 47.8% after 1-3 years, and 21.1% for more than three years. There was a statistically significant relationship between urinary incontinence and the number of pregnancies, the delivery number, and the urinary incontinence during pregnancy while a statistically significant relationship wasn't found between delivery type and urinary incontinence. A statistically significant relationship was found between the time passed postpartum and urinary incontinence. The life quality of women with urinary incontinence was lower. It was found that women had serious urinary incontinence problems in the postpartum period and women with incontinence complaints had lower life quality regardless of urinary incontinence type. By considering that urinary incontinence symptoms are not an inevitable consequence of delivery, women should be provided with healthcare services in the presence of postpartum urinary incontinence.

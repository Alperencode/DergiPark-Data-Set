Makale Başlığı: The Family Concept in the Parable of Salur Kazan’s Killing  Seven-Headed Dragons
Özet: The foundation of society rests on the family, and the latter relies on the individual. The existence or demise of both individual and society depends on the sustainability of the family institution. The development of Turkish national and spiritual values over the centuries is directly related to the concept of ‘hearth’. What makes the Turkish hearth immortal are its foundational principles and the duties that society imposes on its individuals. Folkloric elements which prove that these duties have survived till now are valuable resources for researchers. The epic stories named Dede Korkut, consisting of twelve stories combined with The Vatican and Dresden copies, reflect the cultural roots of the period when the Turks became acquainted with Islam, and, are the narratives in which the mentioned institution and its values are kept alive. This article analyses “The Story about How Salur Kazan Killed the Seven-Headed Dragon" which was presented as the thirteenth dimension to the scientific world just a year ago, from a sociological perspective by referring to the gender roles, and, focusing on the family concept, highlights the values that gives a nation its identity.

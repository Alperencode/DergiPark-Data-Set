Makale Başlığı: The Examinaton Of Relationships Among Static And Dynamic Balance, Speed And Agility In Female Football Players
Özet: The aim of this study was öto examine relationship among stability, speed and agility at female soccer players. The twenty-threee female soccer players participated in this study voluntarily (n=23, age=15.69±1.39 years, height=161.33±5.48 cm, weight=55.04±8.44 kg). The stability parameters of female soccer players were measured as static stability at opened and closed eyes positions and dynamic stability by stability measurement device. The 10, 30 and 40 meters sprint tests ans Illinois agility test were performed on synthetic turf soccer pitch by electronic photocell system. The 10, 30 and 40 meters sprint and Illinois agility test durations were determined. All tests were performed on different days and at the same time of day. The relationship stability, speed and agility parameters was determined by Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. According to analyze results, there was no significant correlation among stability, speed and agility parameters except for the correlation between the 30 meters sprint values and ATE (average track error) values from stability parameters. Consequently, it might be said that there was no significant relationship among stability, speed and agility parameters of female soccer players and stability ability at female soccer players could not be affected by speed and agility abilities.

Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL DISSENT IN THE SCHOOL
Özet: The aim of this research is to examine the relationship between school governance and organizational dissent. The research was designed with a descriptive relational survey model. The population consists of 3462 teachers working in public secondary schools in Onikişubat and Dulkadiroğlu districts of Kahramanmaraş in the 2019-2020 academic year, and the sample consists of 600 teachers from the population, determined by the "convenience sampling" method. The "School Governance Scale" developed by Yüner, the "Organizational Dissent Scale" adapted to Turkish by Ergün and Çelik, and the "Personal Information Form", which includes the demographic information of the participants, were used as data collection tools in the research. Percentage, frequency, arithmetic mean and standard deviation values were found by using the appropriate analysis software of the data obtained from the research, t-Test was used for variables with two categories, and ANOVA analysis was used for variables with more than two categories. According to the findings, it has been determined that there is a positive, significant but low-level relationship between teachers' perceptions of the transparency and adherence to law dimensions of school governance and the internal dissent dimension of organizational dissent. However, no significant relationship was found between the teachers' perceptions of the dimension of participation and the dimension of internal dissent, and between the dimension of external dissent and their perceptions of all sub-dimensions of school governance. Accordingly, it was seen that the increase or decrease of organizational dissent in schools was not highly correlated with school governance.

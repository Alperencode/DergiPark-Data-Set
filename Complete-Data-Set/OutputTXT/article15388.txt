Makale Başlığı: Development of Olive Harvesting Machine by Shaking
Özet: Olive harvesting machine by shaking was developed and fabricated using local materials with required specifications. The developed elements were frame and hitch, gear assembly, input and transmission shafts, vibrating unit, connecting rod, limb clamp, and transmission system. This research work aimed to evaluate the developed olive harvester capable to perform harvesting operation in the proper time using the tractor as the available economic source of power. Measurements covered the properties of olive fruit, stem, and limb for five olive varieties: Agizi, Manzanillo, Picholine, Kalamata and Arbiquen. The developed harvester was tested at three levels of frequency; 3.3, 6.7, and 10 Hz, four levels of stroke; 40, 80, 120, and 160 mm, and three levels of shaking time 60, 120 and 180 s. Results indicated that the effective range to attach the clamp on the olive limb were 30 to 40% of limb length. The average value of the maximum bending stress affecting the limb and limb deflection were 16.5 MPa and 196.6 mm respectively. In addition, results have provided the suitability of the developed shaker to harvest olive fruit. The suitability of the developed machine was judged through the fruit removal percentage. The values of performance parameters of olive harvester were 10 Hz optimum shaking frequency, 120 mm of stroke, and 120 s of shaking time.

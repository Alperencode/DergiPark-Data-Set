Makale Başlığı: The Examination of Construction Techniques of High-Rise Buildings
Özet: Today, factors such as the ever-increasing world population and rapid urbanization pose the problem of decreasing terrain and greenfield stocks. Constructing high-rise buildings is becoming necessary to meet the working and housing needs that come along with population growth by utilizing the current field stock most effectively. In high-rise buildings that can be built using various techniques the search for new construction techniques, along with the fields of developments in material and construction knowledge, has been initiated. In this study that aims to examine construction techniques used in high-rise building constructions, construction techniques of high-rise buildings have been examined through application examples in detail. As a result of the examination, it was concluded that with the construction of high-rise structures, the use of structures with a mixed function has become widespread; depending upon the advances in building technologies, it has become possible to plan structures of different forms in high-rise building designs; and it is important for architects and designers to conduct interdisciplinary work at the design and implementation stages of high-rise structures to ensure that the structure is resistant and durable as well as aesthetic and functional.

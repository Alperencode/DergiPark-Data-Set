Makale Başlığı: Long-term radiological and clinical results of incomplete triple pelvic osteotomy
Özet: Objectives; Here we present a review of the long-term experience with incomplete triple pelvic osteotomy in acetabular dysplasia patients whose short-term results were published previously and a comparison with the results of other, current osteotomy techniques.  Patients and Methods; Twenty-six hips of 24 patients treated with incomplete triple pelvic osteotomy by a single surgeon from February 1995 to October 2001 were retrospectively reviewed at an average of 12 years. The mean age at the time of operation was 21.6 years. Radiological evaluation was based on the central edge angle, acetabular angle, acetabular index, acetabular head index and lateralisation. Clinical and radiological scoring was performed using the Harris scoring system, Ömeroğlu scoring system and the Tönnis criteria for osteoarthritis.  Results and Conclusion; Significant improvements in all of the radiological parameters were determined, with 88.5% good radiological results, together with 96.2% excellent clinical results, no significant progression to osteoarthritis and no need for conversion to total hip arthroplasty. The major complication rate was 11%. Retroversion was seen in 15.4% of the hips. Our results support the use of incomplete triple pelvic osteotomy as a safe choice in the treatment of acetabular dysplasia as it offers clinical and radiological benefits and contributes to the prevention of osteoarthritis. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0403This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Özet: The presence of Catholic communities in Istanbul date back to the pre-Ottoman period, and their number increased in the Ottoman economic and political context. Even though the Levantines have been the subject of numerous popular history works, we can observe a relatively smaller academic interest in the issue. This article is a review of a recent academic book on Croatian Levantines in pre-modern and modern Ottoman Istanbul penned by an Ottoman historian from a fresh perspective.

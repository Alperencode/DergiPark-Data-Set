Makale Başlığı: Native English-speaking Teachers (NESTs) in the Minority: How Do Three NESTs at a University in Türkiye Perceive Their Professional Identities?
Özet: This research paper explored the experiences of three NESTs working at a Turkish university dominated by local ELT practitioners. In-depth interviews with the participants combined with lesson observations were implemented with an aim to gain a deeper understanding into how their professional identities were affected by their working conditions and how they adapted to being the only native English-speaking teachers at their university. The findings showed that the participants’ sense of responsibility and pressure to fit an idealized model of a NEST negatively affected their professional identities. The participants devised several strategies to adapt to their working environment such as modifying cultural content to accommodate for their students' monocultural background. In addition, their working conditions hindered their ability to establish close ties with their professional community. Further studies in this area can implement a longitudinal design to explore how a similar working context affects the long-term development of NESTs’ professional identities.

Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation on Prosumer YouTubers in the Context of the Mass Self-Communication System
Özet: This study examines how the video sharing application YouTube has gradually turned YouTuber into a profession, drawing on Castells' mass self-communication and Toffler's producer-consumer concepts. The study firstly presents the theoretical background that affirms the new social structure created by the information revolution and technological developments. Then, it briefly analyses the history of the internet, the development of social media and the process of social sharing turning into a money economy. The study is based on qualitative descriptive analytic approach. It presents the professionalisation journey of "YouTuber" as a phenomenon through the examples of PewDiePie and Enes Batur channels based on a human-based approach to the field. This study concludes that YouTubers can be considered as an important signal of a postmodern society.

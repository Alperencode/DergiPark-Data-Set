Makale Başlığı: Bibliometric analysis of international studies using outdoor recreation and sustainability concepts together
Özet: Though outdoor leisure has become a significant topic, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic, it is referred to in international literature as “outdoor recreation” in English. It is feasible to reduce the negative impacts caused by the organization of these activities by encouraging sustainable outdoor recreation and the wise use of natural resources. The study’s main goal is to investigate research that combines the ideas of open space leisure and sustainability in the worldwide literature using the bibliometric analysis approach. For this purpose, the studies conducted between 1986 and 2022 in the Scopus database on April 15, 2022 were examined in order to present a summary view by using the limitation of title, abstract and keywords. In the studies carried out, “publication year, authors, subject areas, institutions, countries, keywords and sources” were examined and evaluated. The Scopus data were imported to the VOSviewer bibliographic analysis application, and “co-authorship” and “co-occurrence” analyses were performed. As a result of the bibliographic analysis, it was determined that the most studies on the subject were published in 2020 (28 articles) and the “Sustainability Switzerland” journal was the source that included the most (19) studies on this subject. In addition while the United States and the United Kingdom are seen as prominent countries, it has been determined that Turkey is in the 18th place with 5 studies. The evolution of studies in the worldwide literature on open space recreation and sustainability concerns was appraised based on the findings of the bibliographic analysis, and it was attempted to give light on future research.

Makale Başlığı: An Exoskeleton Hand Design and Manufacturing for Persons Losing Hand Function
Özet: This article is to design an exoskeleton hand that can assist physical therapy and direct joint movements of patients whocannot use their hands and fingers, such as congenital or acquired stroke, etc. The exoskeleton hand has been designedwith SolidWorks program and static analysis has been made for the critical parts using the finite element method bySolidWorks. Parts of the designed exoskeleton were printed with a 3D printer, and the Cura program was used as the 3Dinterface. After the assembly of the exoskeleton parts, two separate servo motors were used to provide the necessaryphysical therapy movement. Both of the servomotors are controlled by the Arduino driver.In order to produce the prototype of the designed exoskeleton system, it was chosen printing parameter for possible theshortest production time and in a way that provides the best strength while printing on the 3D printer. The model is printedusing PLA material. Lightweight and durable parts were obtained by producing exoskeleton parts by using PLA material.In addition, the system has been lightened by using high-capacity servo motors, batteries, and low weight. Apparatusessuch as hand splint and gloves are added to the construction for easy use of the user. When all the parts are added, a verylight and user-friendly exoskeleton system has been produced with a total weight of around 450g.

Makale Başlığı: Proximate Composition, Phytochemical Profile, Antioxidant, Antidiabetic and Anti-inflammatory Properties of Justicia carnea Leaf Powder
Özet: Determining the proximate composition, phytochemical profile, antioxidant, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects of Justicia carnea leaf powder (JLP) is the goal of this study. The results revealed that the crude fat (8.19%) had the lowest content in JLP and the nitrogen-free extract (37.85%) had the greatest. JLP included 9.98 percent crude protein, 17.54 % crude fibre, and 18.18 % ash, respectively. Phenol had the highest concentration (383.15 mg/g), whereas flavonoids (1.84 mg/g) had the lowest concentration. Alkaloids, tannins, saponins, and steroids all had concentrations of 24.03 mg/g, 84.81 mg/g, 188.13 mg/g, and 231.3 mg/g, respectively. JLP had a 62.21 % inhibition of lipid peroxidation and a 28.49 % scavenging of ABTS radicals, respectively. The percentages for the DPPH radical scavenging, Fe chelation, and hydroxyl radical inhibition were 54.05 %, 42.81 %, and 54.35 %, respectively. JLP's alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition activities were 65.96 and 65.82 %, respectively. JLP had a 35.51 % albumin denaturation inhibition and a 61.58 % antiprotease activity. Thus, these results suggested that JLP possesses antioxidant, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities.

Makale Başlığı: THE CRIME AND PUNISHMENT FOR BREAKING TOOTH IN THE OTTOMAN LAW
Özet: The Ottoman people were able to seek their rights in the face of justice by applying to the courts and the divan for their various problems. In the archive records, there are complaints about insulting based on vulgar words and swearing, and injuries with tools such as guns, knives, stones and sticks. Apart from these, fist-to-fist fights at home or in public places such as streets, bazaars, markets, and baths were also brought to the courts as a reason for complaint. When the blows to the face and mouth in the fights that took place with close contact resulted in tooth fracture, the person whose tooth was broken complained. In this study, it is emphasized that the incidents of tooth breakage, which are reflected in the Şer'iye Registry, Mühimme Registers, Ahkâm-ı Complaint Registers, and various retail documents, are handled in Islamic and Ottoman law and what sanctions are applied to the criminal. Since there is not a type of crime that is frequently encountered in the archive, the scope of the study has been kept wide, and time and place limitations have not been applied.Due to the important effects of teeth on appearance, speech and nutrition, tooth fracture incidents took their place among the important cases in Ottoman law, and various sanctions were applied to the person who broke the tooth. The first of these was diyet. It has also been seen that ta'zir punishments such as imprisonment and rowing were given for the crime of breaking a tooth. Although there are also penal clauses stating that retaliation can be made, examples of this are rare, and diyet is generally preferred.

Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMPLE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY IN THE 18TH CENTURY: THE NEW ADMINISTRATORS OF THE İLTİZÂM SYSTEM IN THE CASE OF ADANA SANJAK
Özet: The aim of our study is to expose how the use of the new practices in the iltizâm (tax farming) system in the Ottoman finance in the 18th century in the provincial administration changed and transformed the state and society relations. In this context, in order to evaluate the dimension of the state and society relations in the 18th century, the relations of the administrative mechanism with each other and with the society were analyzed within the framework of the concept of consensus. As a result, it has been observed that the conflicts of authority increased with the addition of the newcomers to the rings of ahl-i ‘urf in the countryside, and the reconciliations of these rings with each other and with the state differed both in theory and in practice. The data in hand showed that the problems continue rather than consensus in the state and society relations. Overall, the result of the analysis of the problematic of how the practices within the framework of the concept of consensus are realized in theory and in practice shows that although an agreement was tried to be established between the parties, the consensus rule was often violated, and the consensus ground that was tried to be brought with the mansion practice remained mostly in theory. As a matter of fact, it has been seen that the new provincial administrators, in other words, the new representatives of the state authority, who emerged within the scope of the mansion practice, could not use their powers in a different way from the mültezim (taxpayer) profile in the iltizâm system. In fact, the short-term appointment of mültezims, who are the assistants of the state in administrative and financial organization, as in the iltizâm system, brought their own interests to the fore and finally, led to the addition of a different dimension to the state and society relations by these new and influential actors of the 18th century through the influence and wealth they acquired in the iltizâm system.

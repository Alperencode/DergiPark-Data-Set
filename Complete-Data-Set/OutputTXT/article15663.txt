Makale Başlığı: LONG-TERM SURGICAL OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WITH PHACOMORPHIC GLAUCOMA
Özet: Aims: To retrospectively analyze clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with phacomorphic glaucoma in the Ophthalmology Department of Trakya University Hospital. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with patients who were diagnosed with phacomorphic glaucoma in the Ophthalmology Department of Trakya University Hospital between January 2010 and January 2021. Results: Initially, 19 eyes from 19 patients diagnosed with phacomorphic glaucoma met the inclusion criteria. The mean preoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 0.1 ± 0.3 Snellen visual acuity (ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 Snellen visual acuity). A statistically significant increase in postoperative best-corrected visual acuity during the follow-ups has been observed. In terms of intraocular pressure levels, patients had mean preoperative 32.3 ± 11.2 mmHg (range:15-55 mmHg). The decrease in postoperative intraocular pressure levels during follow-ups was statistically significant. Conclusion: Lens removal through phacoemulsification or intracapsular cataract extraction is an effective and safe procedure in the treatment of phacomorphic glaucoma, ensuring a satisfactory long-term intraocular pressure control and a rapid functional recovery. However, most of the patients are expected to have an outcome of favorable best-corrected visual acuity after surgery in the long term.

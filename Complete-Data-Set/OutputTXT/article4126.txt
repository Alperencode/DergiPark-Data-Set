Makale Başlığı: The Status of  ‘Other’ in the Thought of Nicholas of Cusa - A Philosophical Investigation-
Özet: This study was carried out to examine a different effort to understand the other in the Middle Ages, a period when political, social, cultural and religious conflicts were experienced both between different religions and especially within the great religions. This effort was put forward by Nicholas of Cusa, one of the important names of the early Renaissance. Cusa, who was influential both with her important duties within the papacy and with her academic studies during her lifetime, came to the fore as a humanist, reformist and reconciliation figure. This aspect of Cusa has been the subject of different studies in its theological and historical contexts. In this study, it will be evaluated in terms of its philosophical background. The main thesis of this study is that there is an intellectual accumulation behind the unifying attitude that emerged in Cusa's worldview. This accumulation takes its philosophical basis from Plato's philosophy and its dialectical method.

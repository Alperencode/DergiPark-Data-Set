Makale Başlığı: Some Observations on Old Turkic ‘Sıpızgu’
Özet: In this paper, the musical instrument sıpızgu is emphasized, which has been seen in the vocabulary of Turkic since Old Turkic and survives in modern Turkic languages and dialects with some phonetic changes. Sıpızgu, a wind instrument, is used in the historical dialects of Turkic with the meanings “nay, reed-flute, flute, trumpet, pipe, etc.” In addition to this, it has the meaning of “drum”. The word survives in modern Turkic languages with similar meanings and forms such as sıbıskı, sıbıshı, sımıshı, hıbızğı, sıbızık (because of metathesis), zıbızğı, sibizğa, sivizğa. Furthermore, this study also included alternation r ~ z, which was mentioned earlier by some Turkologists about the word. The following r ~ z word pairs are suggested for the word: CT *sıpır- “to make a whistling sound, whiffle” ~ sıpız “the object which is made a whistling sound; pipe, flute.” The reason for suggesting these word pairs is the following forms found in Yakut, Kirghiz, Azerbaijanian, and Chuvash: Yak. sııbırğaa- “to make a whistling sound”, Kir. sıbızgı- “to make a piercing sound”, Chuv. şăpăr “bagpipe”, Az. sıbız “pruned (tree)”. If sıbız is a “pruned tree”, sıpız+gu may be an instrument made from this tree, or theoretically, it may have been derived from the verb *sıpır- (~ *sıpız-) with the suffix -gu, which derives the name of tools.

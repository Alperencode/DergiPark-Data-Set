Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of Bath Temperature and Current Density on the Mechanical Properties of Galvanized Coating
Özet: One of the methods applied to make the surfaces of metals or alloys more durable and to protect them against the effects of corrosion is to coat the surface with a second metal. The chemical activity of the metal to be used as a coating material should be lower than the metal to be coated. For this purpose, metals such as zinc, copper, tin, chrome, nickel, gold, silver, aluminum are used as coating materials. Since zinc is more reactive than the coated material (iron, steel, etc.), it sacrifices itself and corrodes before steel. The coating of the metal surface with zinc is called galvanization. Galvanized coating is done in two ways as hot dipped and electroplated coating. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of electrolysis coating parameters (bath temperature and current density) on the mechanical properties of the coating. In the applications, the samples were electroplated using three different bath temperatures and four different current densities after undergoing various pre-cleaning processes. By applying these parameters, the thickness of the coating was examined and the hardness results were examined. It was observed that the coating thickness increased with the increase of bath temperature and current density in the acidic bath. However, it is understood from the measurements that these parameters have no effect on the hardness.

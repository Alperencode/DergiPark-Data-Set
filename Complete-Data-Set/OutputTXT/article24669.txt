Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Waste and Environment Management in Printing Industry
Özet: All kinds of materials that become useless duringproduction activities, damage the environment and must be exterminated aregenerally called waste. Waste is also defined as all materials thrown away byits manufacturer or a person or entity who owns it and causes a harmful changeat environment.The most important of the solid, liquid and gaseouswastes produced in the printing industry before, during and after the printingprocess are waste ink, ink sludge and solvents emerging after machine washing,wastewater of water-based ink, plate and film developer and fixer solutions, wastepapers, waste films, faulty prints, cleaning solvents and volatile organiccompound (VOC) emissions emerging from IPA use. Some of these wastes fall intothe hazardous waste category due to their processing characteristics during theproduction process. Effective and regular extermination of these wastes isnecessary to protect the environment and employee health. This can be providedonly by the application of waste management. Some wastes are recycled andreused at printing industry, but in some cases that recycling is impossible,these wastes should be eliminated without harming human health and environment.Especially the materials whose disposal is compulsory should be classified atthe source and sent to licensed disposal companies.As a new sector, waste management industry shoulddevelop new and special processes for printing technologies wastes. Owners ofprinting companies should be informed about waste management. At wastemanagement process, the most appropriate clean production techniques should beused, waste production should be prevented or minimized and wastes should berecycled effectively.The aim of this study is to provide suggestions andcontributions for the possible best ways of preventing the wastes from harmingthe nature and disposing or recycling of the wastes generated during productionin the printing industry.

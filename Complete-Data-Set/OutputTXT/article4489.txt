Özet: In this study, (1-x).Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3/x.Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (x=0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0) composite materials were  prepared using the sol-gel method and the structural, morphological, and electrical properties were investigated. From the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, was observed that there was no change in the crystal structure symmetries of the pure and composite materials. It was found that the main peak of the composite materials changing between the main peaks of Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 and Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 compounds. From atomic force microscopy studies, it has been found that the grain formations on the surface of the compounds are in the same direction and there is not much difference between them. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies have shown that the surface morphologies of Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 and Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 compounds differ from each other.  From the electrical resistivity measurements, it was revealed that the Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 compound was a semiconductor and the Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 compound showed a conductivity behavior below 199.1 K. When 25% of the Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 compound is added to the Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 compound, which has semiconductor properties, the obtained composite material was gained conductivity below 88.4 K. As a result of the increase in the volumetric ratio of the Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 phase, the TIM transition temperature has shifted towards higher temperatures (184.8 K).

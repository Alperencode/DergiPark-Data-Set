Makale Başlığı: A Convolutional Neural Networks Model for Breast Tissue Classification
Özet: Diagnosis of breast cancer and the determination of cancer type are essential information for cancer research in monitoring and managing the disease. Artificial intelligence techniques developed in recent years have led to many developments in medicine, as any information about the patient has become more valuable. Especially, artificial intelligence methods used in the detection and classification of cancer tissues directly assist physicians and contribute to the management of the treatment process. This study aims to classify breast tissues with ten different tissue characteristics utilizing the breast tissue data set, which has 106 electrical impedance spectroscopies taken from 64 patients in the UCI Machine Learning Repository database. Various machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, self-organizing fuzzy logic, and convolutional neural networks are used to classify these tissues with the accuracy of 81%, 78%, 82%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. This study demonstrated the benefit of the usage of convolutional neural networks in cancer detection and tissue classification. Compared to traditional methods, convolutional neural networks provided a more reliable and better results.

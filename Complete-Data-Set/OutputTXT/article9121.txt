Makale Başlığı: Spatial Dependence of Nursing Home Preference of Older Age Population in Turkiye
Özet: It is important that the cost to the economy of Turkey as regards nursing home  needs,  which  is  a  service  provided  for  the  care  of  the  older  population has increased significantly in recent years. As the preference of the older population becomes dense toward the nursing homes affiliated with  the  Turkish  Rebuplic  Ministry  of  Family  and  Social  Services  (MFSS), where the old with low-income levels are taken care of for free, it is observed that their capacities are full and the need for nursing homes has increased. For this reason, this study aimed to determine the spatial dependence of the elderly population in nursing homes among the border neighbors (regions that share a common border) in  26  subregions  (It  is  based  on  the  Turkish  Statistical  Institute's  (TSI)  Second  Level  Nomenclature  Units  for  Territorial  Statistics  (NUTS2))  of  Turkey  and  the  socioeconomic  factors  that  affect  the  elderly  population's  nursing  home  preferences  in  these  regions  using  spatial  data  analysis  for  2016.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  the  spatial dependence of older age population between the Turkey's neighbor subregion 26 (It is based on the TSI  Second  Level  Nomenclature  Units  for  Territorial  Statistics  (NUTS2))  for  the  year  2016  has  been  aimed  to  determine  the  socioeconomic  factors  affecting  the  nursing  home  preferences  of  the  elderly  population  in  these regions using spatial data analysis. Since the regional statistical data of the older age population in the nursing home and senior age population needing the caring service were unavailable after 2016, in this study, spatial data analysis was used just for 2016. It was concluded that the border neighborhood positively affects the older population's preference for nursing homes. In the analysis, it was shown that the disposable income of the population above 60 years, the rate of becoming a house owner, and the older pension do not affect the older age population's preference for nursing home. Additionally, it has been determined that the number of older age population needing the caring service and elementary family structure positively and crimes against the property negatively affects the older age population's preference for nursing homes.

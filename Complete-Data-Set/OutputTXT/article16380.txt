Makale Başlığı: A New Name at the Rank of Genus, Kandemiria (Asteraceae)
Özet: Candollea (Asteraceae), a new genus from Türkiye, was introduced to the scientific world and became homonymous. The new name of Kandemiria (Asteraceae) replaced Candollea at the rank of genus due to presence of many previous generic names for Candollea. This new genus is based on Scorzonera coriacea, S. davisii, S. elata, S. mollis, S. szowitzii and S. turkestanica of the Scorzonera s.l. species with typical features, such as perennial herb; several branched, long, erect, leafy stems; linear, nerved leaves; spiciform, raceme to subcorymbose, scape inflorescence; capitula (1)38 per stem; yellow flowers; and shortly stipitate achenes. The required new combinations of the genus and infrageneric taxa were made. As a result of the homonymous correction of the genus, a new identification key for the closely related genera of this new Kandemiria genus was provided.

Makale Başlığı: Clone Selection Based on Yield Components in the First Generation of 6/7  Clone X 101 Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) Cross
Özet: The true seeds obtained from (6/7 clone x 101 (Nif)) cross genotypes selected during the early potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) breeding studies in Ege University, Department of Field Crops, Faculty of Agriculture were grown in plastic pots in 2019. Tuber number, single tuber weight and plant yield were measured at harvest. Selected clones were tested in 2020 in a seedbed. The assumed normal distribution parameters were estimated for 133 plants and the single stage selection method was applied for tuber number, single tuber weight and plant yield at different selection intensity levels (ì). The sub populations constructed by different selection intensity levels by selecting at different ratios were grown in seedbeds for progeny testing in 2020. Tuber number, single tuber weight and plant yield were measured and means of the selected population for these traits were estimated and compared with the selection differentials estimated in the parent generation. The following results were obtained after comparison of the means obtained from seedbed and selection differentials estimated in the parent populations: 1- Positive correlations were found for tuber number, single tuber weight and plant yield between greenhouse and seedbed populations. 2- The highest selection differential, mean of control population and gain were obtained from p=0.05 selection for tuber number with values of 4.8; 8.9 and 4.1 respectively. 3- Low level selection intensity (i) by selection at p=0.20 and p=0.25 for single tuber weight resulted in high selection differentials and gain with values such as 1.4 g; 10.9 g; 9.5 and 1.2 g; 12.1 g and 10.9, respectively. 4- Moderate level selection differential and gain for plant yield were obtained for high and moderate level selection intensity levels for p=0.10 (6.7 g; 94.9 g and 8.2) and for p=0.15 (5.9 g; 125.4 g and 119.5). It could be concluded that selection for tuber number and plant yield at high selection intensity levels such as p=0.10 and p=0.15 are recommended in greenhouse selection. According to the positive relationship between tuber number and plant yield, selection for single tuber weight at a low level selection differential and selection intensity levels such as p=0.20 and p=0.25 could be considered. Single plant selection at high to moderate level of selection intensity levels could be successfully practiced in early generation selection in potato breeding.

Makale Başlığı: Change of Journalism and Its Representation on Youtube
Özet: The answer to the question “Who is a journalist” has become increasingly more complicated due to the impact of digitalization. Until the millennium, when technology speeded up and became one of the most dominant determinants on daily life, journalism was shaped mostly by politics and capital. Although technology was initially regarded as a threat to journalism, it has brought new business models and behaviour patterns to the profession. One of them that serve this function is the most popular platform of the last period; that’s YouTube journalism. The present study aims to describe the change of journalism and its representation on YouTube with a phenomenological approach. Interviews were conducted with journalists who have YouTube channels, and the reasons and practices of representation in this medium were tried to be understood through their experiences. It was found that journalists attributed their turn to YouTube both to the experience exchange of receivers and to eco-political reasons. Prioritizing the power of interaction, these journalists emphasized that they position themselves in the role of classical journalists and that they were committed to the profession in terms of ethics and standards. The fact that in their contents commentaries outweigh news was attributed by the researchers to the pressure and censorship in the mainstream.

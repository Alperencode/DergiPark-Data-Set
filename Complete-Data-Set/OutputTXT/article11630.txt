Makale Başlığı: PREFACE AND FIRST CHAPTER: GRAMMER OF CASSIODORUS’ WORK TITLED EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLE’S SECOND BOOK: SECULAR LETTERS
Özet: Cassiodorus is an important figure of the Late Antiquity/Middle Ages both with his offices in Ostrogothic Kingdom and his works. Initiating the manuscript copying tradition in Vivarium Monastery which he built after his retirement, he made contributions both to continuity of education within religious medieval places and to conveying the cultural and scientific knowledge to the Middle Ages.In this study besides being the most important work of Cassiodorus, Institutiones, of which I translated the second book’s preface and first chapter, gives encyclopedic definitions of seven liberal arts that formed medieval educational systems, and lays foundations for modern sourcebooks with its given examples and further reading suggestions. My intention is to give a five-chapter translation of the second book, and this study is the first chapter of the aformentioned five chapters.

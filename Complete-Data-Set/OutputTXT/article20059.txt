Makale Başlığı: Contacts with the Language of Uncertainty in Translations of Franz Kafka's Narrative Ein Landarzt
Özet: Franz Kafka's narrative Ein Landarzt / A Country Doctor is one of the main narratives of the author, whose mystery is tried to be solved.Franz Kafka constructs the language of ambiguity while weaving his text with polysemous and paradoxical expressions, but this language is based on the inability to carry the established. The text structure distorts the meaning relations while establishing it, re-establishes it while breaking it, and the meaning is constantly shifted. While the translators create this literary feature, which is a reflection of a perfectly functioning systematicity in the source text, within the conditions of the translation, they may touch the boundaries between making themselves visible and making Kafka and/or the narrative visible. The aim of the study is to examine these contacts in translations through the systematic relations presented by the source text, in terms of the aspects they add to and subtract from the target text fiction, and to clarify the structural criteria in terms of the translation process.

Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of The White Castle Along with the Theorems of Hegel and Freytag
Özet: In this article, The White Castle by Orhan Pamuk is studied through Gustav Freytag’s Freytag’s Pyramid, and the climax points are located. Throughout the study, the vitality of these climax points is discussed, and argued the extent to which they contribute to the narrative. Determining the climax points of the novel strengthens the analysis done regarding this novel and can reshape the consensus formed in the literature about this book. However, before applying the concept of ‘climax’ to the narrative, an intense literature review was utilized. Therefore, the climax points found through employing Freytag’s Pyramid are measured against the pre-set criteria in the literature about climax points in academic works. This approach eliminated the presence of subjectivity in the study. As an outcome of this research, it is found that the climax points can be the times where the author strengthens his implications towards the notion that Hoca and Kole are creating a dual personality. This way, the criticisms lying beneath the relationship between Hoca and Kole about East and West emerge. It is deduced that the everchanging dynamics between them unveil a means of analysis from a Hegelian perspective. Additionally, the everchanging dynamic unveils the climax points, which are the points that they embody a single individuality, unable to carry on existing without one another.

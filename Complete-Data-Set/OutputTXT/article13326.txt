Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of compulsory Arabic textbooks used in Anatolian Imam Hatip High Schools in terms of teaching collocation structures
Özet: When a text or speech in any language is examined, many collocations are encountered. While these structures are learned and used in the mother tongue as a result of ready hearing, in the learning of a foreign language, these structures should be taught as other elements of the language are taught. For this reason, collocations are often included in language teaching materials in order to make words permanent in memory and to determine the boundaries of words. In these materials, especially in books, the semantic relations of collocation structures are emphasized, and questions are included in order to measure their acquisition. The necessity of teaching these structures in all basic skills in language teaching has made it one of the prominent topics in Arabic teaching in recent years. Today, this situation is clearly seen in the Arabic education given in imam hatip high schools affiliated to the Ministry of National Education. In the study, the textbooks preferred as educational materials by the Ministry were evaluated in terms of collocational expressions. As a result of the evaluation, although these structures are not included under a title as a feature of the curriculum adopted in the textbooks, it has been seen that many different collocations are included in order to reveal the contribution of these structures to the meaning. In addition, it is evaluated that the use of these structures in various titles of the textbook is aimed at creating an awareness of teachers and students against collocation in language teaching.

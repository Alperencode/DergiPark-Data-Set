Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Producers' Environmental Awareness, Attitude and Behavior Levels in Pesticide Use
Özet: The aim of this study is to evaluate the environmental awareness, attitude and behavior levels of producers in pesticide applications. The provinces of Antalya and Manisa, where pesticides most intensively used, have been determined as the study area and survey interviews have been conducted with 173 producers according to simple random sampling method. The data obtained have been explained using frequency distribution and a Likert scale, and whether there is a relationship between the variables deemed necessary has been analyzed with the Chi-square test. According to the research findings, it has been determined that 48.55% of the producers received training on the effects of pesticides on human, animal and environmental health, and 34.83% of those who did not receive training wanted to receive training on related issues. While 80.35% of the producers stated that they knew about pesticides that had been removed from the market due to environmental damage in the last two years, more than 65% of them preferred more environmentally oriented pesticides in their pesticide selection, and more than 60% of them say that if the harvest period is not taken into consideration, pesticide residues remain in the product. Producers also have stated that the consumption of products with this pesticide residue was not suitable for human health. It is necessary to increase the awareness, attitude and behavior levels of the producers about the negative effects of pesticides on the environment, human and animal healths. It is needed to ensure that producers should benefit more from the training and extension activities related to the environmental subject.

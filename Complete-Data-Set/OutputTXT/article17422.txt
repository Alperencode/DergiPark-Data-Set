Makale Başlığı: ECO-EFFICIENCY IN EUROPEAN REGIONS AND TÜRKİYE: DYNAMIC SPATIAL PANEL DATA APPROACH
Özet: Purpose: In this study, it is aimed to determine the eco-efficiency levels of Türkiye and selected European countries, as well as to reveal the periodic (short-long) spatial interaction with macroeconomic variables.Methodology: Within the scope of the article, two models are constructed in order to determine the eco-efficiency levels by considering the spatial relations of the countries in the study group. In article, the dynamic spatial panel data method, which gives more inclusive results by showing the results of direct and indirect effects periodically (short-long) unlike the static panel data models, is used.Findings:  As a result of the analysis carried out within the scope of the study, a long and short-term indirect-directly significant spatial relationship is obtained between the eco-efficiency and indicators of the countries.In this context, it is understood that the countries in the study  group should increase the usability levels of environmentally friendly technologies by considering their spatial relations, increase environmental innovation practices, and consider eco-efficiency policies together with development policies.Originality: The study is the first to determine environmental efficiency by taking into account its dynamic spatial relations at the country level.

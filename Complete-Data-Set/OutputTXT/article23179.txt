Makale Başlığı: A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF EARLY ISLAMIC STATES’ STRUCTURES
Özet: Studies on state involve a broad historical spectrum beginning from prehistorical political units to modern nation-states. In this context, social contract is accepted as a concept of modern world, in connection with emerging of the nation state, and it is shaped in a culture mainly within the states in Europe and America which have Christian majority in population. However, historical facts indicate that in the course of the history, examples of social contracts also existed before the modern nation-state era, and at different regions of the world. This study focuses on early Islamic states as an example of the said occurrences and aims to provide a brief overview of the state structure of them. Within this scope, considering the historical facts of the Prophet and Rashidun Caliphate era of the Islamic history, although the historical data related to the said period is scarce, the social contract which was enacted by the main social and religious groups of Medina in 622 provides adequate elements to understand the main structure of the state at a very basic level. Thus, it can be stated that the first Islamic state established in Medina was based on a social contract, had a constitution in its unique character, forming not a secular but a religious pluralistic state, created its unique legislative and judiciary structure, and the ruler was authorized with the explicit written consent of the governed. However, after the Rashidun Caliphate period, the Islamic state structure departed from its uniqueness and Islamic states became dynasties which had similarities to their contemporary governments.

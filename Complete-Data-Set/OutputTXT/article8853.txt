Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Limitations at Different Salt Ratios on Growth and Biochemical Composition of Tetraselmis suecica (Chlorodendrophyceae)
Özet: Algae are plant organisms that produce organic molecules in the aquatic environment and absorb carbon. Since algae are photosynthetic organisms, they give oxygen to the environment. Algae, one of the most important living resources of the seas, are used in many fields such as food, agriculture, cosmetics, medicine, pharmacy, industry and also as a biofuel source thanks to the metabolites they store in the cell. In the study carried out to determine the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus limitations at different salinity rates on the chlorophyll a, dry weight, optical density, protein, lipid and fatty acid contents of the microalgae Tetraselmis suecica from the class Chlorodendrophyceae cultured in the laboratory conditions, at ‰15, 30 and 45 salinity rates 50% N and 50% P reductions were applied. The lowest growth was detected in the culture containing 50% N(-). The highest lipid ratio was determined as 39.8±1% in the 50% N(-) group, while the closest ratio was 34.6% in the 50% P(-) group. The highest polyunsaturated fatty acids were determined in the group containing 50% P(-) at all salinity values. The protein value was determined as 22.3% in the 50% P(-) group and 15.7% in the 50% N(-) group at ‰30 salinity.

Makale Başlığı: An interestıng rare case of ectopic liver
Özet: Ectopic liver is a liver tissue that is not connected to the main liver, also known as a hepatic choristoma or hepar succenturiatum. It’s a rare developmental anomaly that is usually detected incidentally during autopsy and surgery. It’s incidence has been reported to range from 0.24%-0.47%. It’s most commonly seen in the gallbladder, but less frequently in other organs. Multiple cholelithiasis was detected in the ultrasonography of a 38-year-old female patient who applied to our outpatient clinic with the complaint of abdominal pain. We presented an interesting and rare case of ectopic liver incidentally detected on the gallbladder during elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ectopic liver tissue is an abnormality that should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of masses occupying space in the gallbladder. It’s usually clinically silent and found by chance. If there is pathology in the gallbladder, surgical treatment is recommended due to the risk of resection with the gallbladder and increased risk of hepatocellular malignancy if it’s outside the gallbladder.

Makale Başlığı: PREVIOUS AND SUBSEQUENT CASES OF RESTORATION OF STRUCTURES THAT HAVE UNDERGONE RESTORATION IN URLA ART STREET
Özet: Urla, which has a historical texture; is a settlement located in Izmir that contains traces of the history and life of the civilizations that lived in the region. Over the years, the construction in the center of Urla has been concentrated on Zafer Street, which is now called Art Street. The Greek name of this street, which was later called Art Street, is ‘Farid Street’. In recent years, the street has become a focus of tourists with increasing interest in the center of Urla. The reason for this interest is that it contains traces of civilizations and has a historical texture, as well as there are workshops on the street where artists can produce and sell at the same time. In addition, this area is a site where there are registered examples of civil architecture. However, restoration and restitution works have been carried out in many structures. In this study, restoration and restitution studies of historical buildings located on Art Street, which have been the focus of attention in recent years, were examined and information was given about their status before and after restoration. As a result, Urla Art Street, which has become a living “place” more than a corridor passing through it, has successfully completed its urban transformation in our country after successful restoration processes, has become one of the few examples.

Makale Başlığı: Active surveillance for asymptomatic kidney stones
Özet: DOI: 10.26650/cjm.2019.43.3Despite the advances in the management ofurinary tract stone disease, data on the natural history of stones areinsufficient. Therefore, the aim of this review is to present the naturalhistory of asymptomatic kidney stones and the results of their activesurveillance in the light of the current studies.Taking into account thecurrent findings, it can be said that asymptomatic kidney stones transitspontaneously in 3%–30% of patients, become symptomatic in 12%–50%, andnecessitate active treatment in 10%–26%. Active surveillance may be recommendedin appropriate cases considering the results of prophylactic treatments.Cite this article as: Özman O, Önal B.Active Surveillance for Asymptomatic Kidney Stones.

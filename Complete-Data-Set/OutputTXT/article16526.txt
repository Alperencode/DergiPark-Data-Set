Makale Başlığı: Examining The Child's Needs With An Ecological System Approach  In Determining Values To Be Subject To Education
Özet: In determining the attitudes and behaviours that people will take in the face of various events and phenomena, they take into account their needs and expectations, as well as the needs and expectations of the groups they belong to and the society they live in. This situation is closely related to the determination of the needs and expectations of the students, the regulation of their educational status, in other words, the regulation of the external conditions that will provide their learning experiences. These needs and expectations form the basis of value education systems as well as educational situations. This study focuses on the needs and expectations of the child himself, the group / groups he belongs to and the society he lives in in determining the values within the framework of content preparation studies in education. The problem of this study, which is based on literature review and document review, is it possible to have a holistic understanding and approach that will enable children to develop a common understanding of value within the framework of the parameters mentioned above. Within the field, the studies on the relationship between the needs and expectations of the aforementioned stakeholders and value development are limited; In addition, the lack of sufficient awareness, depth and level of knowledge about the relationship in question is one of the issues that make this study important.

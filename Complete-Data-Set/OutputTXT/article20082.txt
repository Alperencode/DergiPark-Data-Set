Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the anxiety of individual and team athletes catching the new type of corona virus (covid-19). A total of 575 athletes were asked to fill in the anxiety scale of catching the Corona vi-rus. Independent t-test and one-way Anova tests were used for statistical differences. A statistically significant difference was found between the total scale scores of individual anxiety and anxiety of catching a new type of corona virus according to gender (p<0.05). Social anxiety scores according to gender did not show a statistically significant difference (p>0.05). A significant difference was found in the anxiety of catching the new type of corona virus according to team and individual sports (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety according to team and individual sports, sports branches and age categories (p>0.05). It has been determined that while the anxiety of catching the corona virus in individual and team athletes varies according to gender, individual and team sports, it is similar according to sports branch and sports age group. It can be said that the athletes have a moderate level of anxiety about catching the corona virus. It is recommended to raise awareness about anxiety.

Makale Başlığı: Effects of foliar silicon (Si) applications on tobacco plant under salt stress
Özet: While salinity is among the most important abiotic stress factors that negatively affect yield and quality in plants, silicon (Si) is known as an element that reduces stress factors in plants. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the protective effect of foliar silicon (Si) applications against the damage caused by salt stress in tobacco plants. In the study, Si applications were made once and twice from the leaves of Canik 190/5 tobacco cultivars grown under four different (0, 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 dS m-1) salt doses. Shoot dry matter yield, Na, K, Ca, Mg, P concentration and K/Na ratio were investigated. While increasing doses of salt applications caused a decrease in the shoot dry matter yield of the tobacco plant, foliar Si applications slowed the decrease in dry matter yields. While the average plant dry matter yield of control applications was 6.42 g plant-1, this value increased to 6.65 g plant-1 in the application of Si once from the leaf, and it increased to 7.08 g plant-1 in the application of Si application twice from the leaf. Silicon applications caused a decrease in Na concentrations of the tobacco plant, and increased the plant's resistance to salt by causing an increase in K concentrations and K/Na ratios. According to the results obtained; It has been revealed that foliar Si applications may have a positive effect on increasing the resistance of the tobacco plant against salt stress, and in terms of the number of applications, 2 applications on the leaf are more effective.

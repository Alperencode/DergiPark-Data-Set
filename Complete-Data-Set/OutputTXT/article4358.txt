Makale Başlığı: HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF  THE CONCEPT OF CHILDREN’S RIGHTS
Özet: Children are often called “our future”. According to Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly’s decision dated 20 November 1989 and numbered 44|25 and opened for signature, ratification and accession, every human being up to the age of eighteen is considered a child. Children are valuable, individually unique, vulnerable and defenceless. Children can arouse sympathy and affection not only in their parents or guardians, but also in strangers. Today almost everything, that is related to children, to their health, psychology, happiness, in any extent is supposed to be a sensitive topic. But was childhood always appreciated in such a way throughout the history of humanity? What “a child” means today was different from the what it meant in antiquity or in the medieval times.Furthermore, like a child depends on his/her parents or guardians, or at least on any adult beside him/her to survive, the concept of childhood is also closely connected to the concept of parenthood. It is the parents, that make a child, and it is the parenthood, that creates childhood. So, it is very significant to comprehend both concepts separately, to reveal relationship and mutuality between them, meanwhile having a historical and chronological view over the attitude towards children and childhood.

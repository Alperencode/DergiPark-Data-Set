Makale Başlığı: A mini-invasive procedure for treating arthrofibrosis of the knee
Özet: Objective: The purpose of this study was to introduce a novel mini-invasive operative technique comprising mini-incision release, "pie-crusting" lengthening of the quadriceps extensor, and arthroscopic lysis of the arthrofibrotic knee and to report the treatment outcomes of 17 consecutively treated severely arthrofibrotic knees. Methods: From 2010 to 2014, 17 patients with severely arthrofibrotic knees were treated with this operative technique. The mean follow-up duration was 23 months. The knee range of motion (ROM) was assessed with a goniometer. The functional outcomes were evaluated according to the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score and Judet's criteria. Results: The ROM significantly improved from 29.7° (range, 7° to 56°) preoperatively to 127° (range, 120° to 136°) at the final follow-up in all patients (p<0.001). According to Judet's criteria, all patients achieved excellent results (ROM>100°). The HSS score was improved from 70 points (range, 60 - 85 points) preoperatively to 91 points (range, 84 - 98 points) (p<0.001) at the final follow-up. No extension lag, skin necrosis, quadriceps weakness, wound dehiscence or quadriceps tendon rupture occurred. Conclusions: Mini-invasive quadricepsplasty-associated arthroscopic lysis and manipulation of the knee in flexion is simple and easy and should be considered as a legitimate treatment for arthrofibrosis of the knee. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0266This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

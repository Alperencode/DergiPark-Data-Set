Makale Başlığı: Obesogens: Definition, mechanisms of action, potential industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals
Özet: The incidence of obesity and related diseases increased dramatically in the last decade. Some endocrine disruptors were shown to interact with metabolic processes via various cellular mechanisms, disrupt homeostasis in adipose tissue, resulting in weight gain and obesity. These chemicals are called “obesogens”. Today, with the increased use of industrial chemicals, individuals are exposed to a mixture of chemicals at very low doses. Most of these industrial chemicals have been investigated for their possible endocrine disrupting and obesogenic effects. Beside these chemicals, pharmaceuticals can also have similar adverse effects, however, limited studies have been performed to investigate such effects of drugs. Furthermore, there are few studies investigating the relationship between prenatal exposure to pharmaceuticals and childhood obesity. Therefore, to clarify the endocrine disrupting and obesogenic effects of the pharmaceuticals, which are prescribed during pregnancy, mechanistic studies should be performed, and necessary precautions should be taken. In this paper, we reviewed the mechanisms of obesogens, briefly overview several well-known obesogenic industrial chemicals and focused more on potential obesogenic pharmaceuticals.

Makale Başlığı: The Use of Health Informatics and Information Technology: The Situation in Botswana
Özet: Health Informatics (HI) and Information Technology (IT) have enormous potential to improve healthcare quality in countries around the world. A literature review was used to conduct a situational analysis of the use of HI and IT in Botswana's health sector. According to research, there is a significant gap in the available information on the status of HI and the challenges that affect Botswana's healthcare sector. As technology evolves, a frequent situation analysis is required to remedy or improve on challenges encountered during development and implementation, particularly in the health sector. The current study explores present status of HI and IT in Botswana's healthcare system as well as successes, opportunities and challenges faced in the development of e-Health and HI in Botswana. An extensive literature review was carried out to provide a conceptual background of e-Health and HI in Botswana. The paper provides incalculable data on e-Health and HI in Botswana that will be useful in informing future studies, policies and developments in the field of HI and e-Health in Botswana and other developing countries.

Makale Başlığı: Green Computing Practices in the Tourism Sector
Özet: Despite its labor-intensive nature, the tourism sector frequently benefits from information and communication technologies by adopting new technological approaches with a smart tourism vision. These approaches and practices, which make business processes easier and more effective in the sectoral sense, undoubtedly have many important effects on the protection of environmental resources. However, it is also a fact that information and communication technologies have negative effects on environmental resources, and at this point, the importance of green computing practices emerges in order to reduce or eliminate the related negative effects. In the light of this information, in this research, it is aimed to evaluate the green computing practices in the tourism sector conceptually, to reveal sector-specific recommendations and to create a conceptual framework that will have a widespread impact on the relevant literature. As a result of this research, which was conducted based on secondary data sources within the scope of qualitative research methods, it was concluded that green computing practices contribute to the protection of environmental resources, enrich the travel experience of tourists and contribute significantly to the competitive advantage of tourism businesses on a global scale.

Özet: The rate of unplanned urbanization has increased with modern industrialization and the increase in migration from rural to urban areas, and as a result, people have been exposed to environmental problems (decrease in natural resources, noise, pollution, etc.). With deteriorations such as irreversible environmental problems, loss of mental and physical health of the city-dwellers a decrease in productivity in business life and difficulties in socialization have occurred, which has made green infrastructure systems in and around cities important. In this context, urban forests, which is an important part of the urban green infrastructure system, were discussed. In the study, a survey was conducted with a group of 130 people and primarily the awareness of the citizens about the open space recreation tendencies and the concept of the urban forest was specified. Then, the preferability of the 100. Yıl Park, Atatürk Mansion and Boztepe forest areas, which are in the green area system of Trabzon city as urban forests was discussed. Obtained data were evaluated as recreational and functional in line with the needs of people. Consequently, it has been emphasized that the urban forests planned with ecological design approaches should be given priority in the city of Trabzon.

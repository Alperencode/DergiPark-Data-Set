Makale Başlığı: A Perspective on Kalâm from the Eyes of the Faculty of Theology Students (Case of Kocaeli Unıversıty Faculty of Theology)
Özet: We observe that Islam is a religion on which humanity has concentrated and their interest has increased in a positive or negative way, from its birth to the present. Since the first century following the birth of Islam, we see that it has been examined in various aspects by societies belonging to different beliefs and cultures from close and distant. It is a known fact that with the rapid spread of Islam as a result of the conquests, Muslims encountered societies belonging to different religions, and encountered unexpected situations, including different cultures and economic situations. The need to deal with all aspects of the last religion, Islam, to determine its place and position against different religions and beliefs, and to protect its integrity against them has emerged. Thus, while reinforcing the beliefs of his followers, on the other hand, he created a system by revealing the mistakes of the other party. It was the science of Akāid and Kalām that established this system and determined and consolidated the place and position of the religion of Islam against other beliefs. Today, we are witnessing the emergence of many thoughts contrary to the Islamic belief system and the increasing destruction of this fact that has been going on for centuries. It is beyond the explanation that there is a necessity to struggle with these currents that are fed with different ideas such as Atheism, Deism, Positivism, Rationalism, Materialism, Nihilism, Agnosticism, Evolutionism and Darwinism, Pantheism, Panentheism and Freud Psychoanalysis, which are accepted by different societies today.

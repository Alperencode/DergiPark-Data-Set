Makale Başlığı: Development of Recreational Barriers Scale of Mothers with Child Between 0-2 Years Old and Making Its Validity and Reliability for Turkish Population
Özet: This study aims to develop the Recreational Barriers Scale of Mothers with a child between 0-2 Years Old (RBSM-02) and make its validity and reliability for the Turkish population.The study is descriptive and is limited to mothers with a child aged 0-2. The random sampling method was used in this study, and the sample group consisted of 213 mothers (Xage = 29.33 ± 4.78). In this study, a questionnaire form with a list of questions indicating the recreational barriers of mothers with a child aged 0-2 was used as a data collection tool. The questionnaire was applied in baby/child supplies stores, family medicine clinics, and pediatric polyclinics of hospitals between 1th October and 15th December 2019.Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to the data set. Ten items with variance value less than 0.5 and factored in factors other than the expected factor were removed from a total of 64 item lists. EFA was reapplied to the remaining 54 items, and the result of KMO was 0.841 and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity was X2 = 10279.568, SD = 1431, p = 0.000, and a total of 54 items, and 13 factors were obtained. The item-Total correlation was used as a result of factor analysis. In order to evaluate the internal consistency of the scale, the Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the sub-dimensions formed as a result of EFA examined, and the Pearson correlation coefficients were examined to look at the relationship between the factors of the scale obtained, and the results were questioned at the significance level of 0.01 and 0.05. Factors obtained as a result of EFA was named as; Physical Perception and Health, Perception of Ability, Lack of Facility-Service, Insufficient Budget / Finding Expensive, Pressure from Family and Others, Child-related Barriers, Not Designing Facilities for Mothers with Infants, Indifference, Caregiver-related Barriers, Lack of Friends, Transportation, Family Reasons and Lack of Information. According to the research results, the Cronbach's Alpha coefficient of the RBSM-02 scale was 0.935, and the variance explained by the scale was 78.919%. As a result, it has been concluded that the RBSM-02 has validity and reliability, and the scale is sufficient for the Turkish population.

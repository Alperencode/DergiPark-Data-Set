Makale Başlığı: Examination of Pre-service Teachers' Attitudes towards Children's Rights by Gender: A Meta-Analysis Study
Özet: In this study, a quantitative research approach and meta-analysis method were used, and there were 11 studies selected according to certain criteria from thesis, article, and book chapters in the Google Academic, TRIndex, and Council of Higher Education National Thesis Center search system’s databases between 2006-2020. The study sample consists of 3466 pre-service teachers, 2256 of whom were female and 910 male. As a result of the research, according to the random effects model, it was seen that the effect size of the attitudes of pre-service teachers related to children's rights was moderately in favor of female pre-service teachers. In the subgroup analysis, although the publication year and type of publication did not make a significant difference in the level of effect size, it was determined that the moderator of the teaching field made a significant difference. Researchers who will study this subject may be advised to conduct qualitative research on why male pre-service teachers have lower attitudes toward children's rights than female pre-service teachers. In addition, it is thought that the inclusion of achievements and the design of activities in teacher training programs to improve the attitudes of male pre-service teachers towards children's rights may be beneficial in this regard.

Makale Başlığı: The Investigation of School Administrators' English Self-efficacy Beliefs
Özet: The purpose of this study is to determine the English self-efficacy beliefs of school administrators. The research adopts the cross-sectional survey model to determine the English self-efficacy beliefs of school administrators. The sample of the study consists of 305 administrators working in schools in the districts of Konya, Türkiye. In the study, the “English self-efficacy belief scale” developed by Hancı Yanar and Bümen (2012) was used to determine English self-efficacy beliefs. The measurement tool used in the study was applied in April 2022. According to the results of the study, school administrators' English selfefficacy beliefs are at a low level (the level of "very little fits"). While the level of English self-efficacy beliefs of school administrators showed a significant difference according to the variables of duty, professional seniority and administration seniority, there was no significant difference based on gender, age, educational status and school type variables. Language activities can be organized in schools with the participation of all education stakeholders in order to increase the English self-efficacy of school administrators depending on the language training to be carried out.

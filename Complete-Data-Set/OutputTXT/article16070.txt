Özet: Nephus includens Kirsch (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is one of the most important predators of the mealybug, Planococcus ficus (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), which one of the important pests of vineyards. In this study, the consumption capacity and preference of N. includens for the mealybug’s stages, were investigated. The experiments were carried out in a climate-controlled cabinet at 25 ± 1°C, 60 ± 10% R.H and 16:8 hrs (light: dark). The egg stage of the mealybug was the stage most consumed by all of the larval stages and the adult of N. includens. Also, the consumption level by the predator decreased with the progression in the development stage of the mealybug. It was also determined that the level of consumption by the predator increased with the progression of its larval stages, and that the highest consumption was by the adult stage of the predator on all mealybug stages, except the egg. The first nymphal stage of the mealybug was the stage most preferred by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd larval stages and the adult stage of the predator, whereas the egg stage was most prefered by the 4th larval stage of the predator.

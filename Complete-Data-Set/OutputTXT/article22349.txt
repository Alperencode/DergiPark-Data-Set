Makale Başlığı: ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS FROM TREATMENT TO DIAGNOSIS: A CASE REPORT
Özet: Abdominal tuberculosis presents with various clinical presentations. Abdominal tuberculosis is an increasing type of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Although it is seen as secondary to diseases that suppress immunity such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus or systemic chemotherapy in developed countries, it is seen in developing countries, such as our country, due to crowded family structure and poor hygiene. Patients generally present with symptoms such as fever, weight loss, infertility, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis is difficult due to its variability in symptoms and the limitations of available diagnostic tests. The most important factor for diagnosis is to suspect the disease. In approxiamately 20% of patients are diagnosed by treatment. Most patients responds well to antituberculosis therapy and very few patients needs surgery. In this case report, it is aimed to discuss a patient with a prediagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis in the light of literature

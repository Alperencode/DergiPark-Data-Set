Makale Başlığı: THE ROLE OF MUSIC IN EVIDENCE BASED MUSIC THERAPY PRACTICES
Özet: Music has always existed among health practices in all societies around the world throughout human history. In this context, many of our historical values such as Bergama Asklepion and Edirne Daruşşifa testify that in the past, health music practices were more common and settled in Anatolia compared to other geographies. Musicbased health practices, which remained behind the modern developments in the medical world and were almost forgotten, were rediscovered in the western world since the 1950s, and over time, it gained its current scientific structure under the name of Music Therapy. Network neuroscience studies, which have examined music-brain relationships in many ways in recent years, provides important information revealing that music is not a direct healing 'miracle drug', but a powerful and useful ‘tool' to improve human health. However, despite all these developments, confusion continues regarding the use of music for health purposes both in our country and in the world. In this article, the prominent features of music in the context of music-brain interaction andthe real role of music in evidence-based music therapy are discussed.

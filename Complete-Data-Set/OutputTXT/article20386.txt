Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Polymerizatıon Procedures on Color Stability of Indirect Resin Restorations
Özet: Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different polymerization procedures on color stability of indirect resin restorations. Materials and Methods: 288 disk-shaped specimens of resin composites(Filtek Z250, Gradia Plus, Ceramage, GrandioSO) were prepared with laboratory and chairside curing device(I.Labolight Duo/II. Elipar S10). Then, baseline color measurements were performed. Specimens of each composite were randomly divided into three subgroups according to staining solution(coffee, black tea and distilled water as control group)(n=12). Color measurements were performed and ΔE values were calculated. The data were evaluated by using ANOVA for repeated measures and multiple comparisons were determined by Bonferroni test(p0.05). Results: Staining increased over time for all groups and coffee showed the highest staining potential(p<0.05). Polymerization procedures also affected color stability(p<0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that different polymerization procedures and staining solutions might affect color stability of resin composites tested.

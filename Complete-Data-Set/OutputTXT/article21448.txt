Makale Başlığı: Solvability and maximal regularity results for a differential equation with diffusion coefficient
Özet: We consider  a second-order differential equation with  rapidly growing intermediate coefficients. We obtain a  solvability result in the cases that the diffusion coefficient  of equation is unbounded or it tends to zero at the infinity. Under additional conditions, we prove the $L_p - $ maximal regularity  estimate for the solution of this equation.

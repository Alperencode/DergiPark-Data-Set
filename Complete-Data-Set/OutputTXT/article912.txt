Özet: Media has an important place in terms of its effects on social life. The power to influence social life is directly proportional to the technological-discursive capacity of the media. The study aims to measure the reputation attributed to communication tools in the social field based on the capacity of the media. Accordingly, it also aims to discover reputation of media in the constituent generations and cultural capital through level of education. In addition, the differentiation of reputation scores of televisions, internet, newspaper, and social media according to generations has been examined. The data used in the study were taken from a research project supported by TUBITAK. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 4840 participants in 12 cities selected according to the first level of Turkish Statistical Regional Units Classification (NUTS1). Sampling representation power was increased through gender and age quota proportional allocation in the study. As per the findings, television and the internet received highest reputation scores followed by social media and newspapers. Generation and educational levels have been affected by media reputation scores. Each generation places more value on the popular media of its time. This situation is evaluated as a reflection of all kinds of likes or preferences shaped by the generation. As the level of education increases, people move away from the old media and gives a predisposition of how to use the media.

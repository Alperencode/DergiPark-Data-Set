Makale Başlığı: IS KURDISH REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ A NEW PERIPHERAL FRIEND FOR ISRAEL?
Özet: Israel’s relations with the surrounding countries have generally been explained with respect to the Arab-Israel dispute or with Israel’s famous periphery doctrine. It is not known whether the concept of the peripheral strategy still dominates the minds of Israeli political elite. However, important changes have been shaping the Middle East, Iraq is no longer an important enemy, and on some parts of it there exists the Kurdish Regional Government, a friendly entity for Israel. Moreover, regional instability and the need for security leaves the Jewish state with little choice but to form alternative friends among the states close to its geographical vicinity, and it is clear that a friendly Kurdish state would enable Israel to live easily in the Middle East. It seems that in the foreseeable future the Kurdish Regional Government will be an important partner for Israel, and as for Kurdish Regional Government, Israel will be a significant role model for it. And this article explores the prospective developments in the relations between Israel and Kurdish Regional Government.

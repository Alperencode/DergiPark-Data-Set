Makale Başlığı: Exploring Teacher Knowledge in Natural Sciences
Özet: This is a qualitative interpretative case study. Its aim is to explore the teacher knowledge of senior phase Natural Sciences teachers. The following question guided the study: What is the nature of teacher knowledge of natural sciences teachers in the senior phase? Semi structured interviews and observations were used to collect data from three purposefully sampled participants. The findings reveal that senior phase teachers have limited content knowledge and inadequate subject matter knowledge and this enflamed misconception which could be transferred to their learners. It is therefore prudent to recommend a re-focus in the in-service teacher training and colleges of Education to improve teacher’s subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge as they could be a barrier to effective teaching and learning and learner’s performance in Natural Sciences.

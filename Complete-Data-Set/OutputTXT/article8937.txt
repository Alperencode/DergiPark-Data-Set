Makale Başlığı: Nutritional value of fish soup from cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss, Walbaum, 1792)
Özet: This study represents new information on the nutritional value of soup prepared from cultured Rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). The proximate contents of soup were represented by 87.56% moisture, 7.22% protein, 1.59% crude fat, 0.07% carbohydrate, 1.17% dietary fibre and 2.44% ash. The energy value was calculated as 48.0 kcal/100g. Amino acid values were in the range of 183.5-1128.5mg/100g while mineral contents were varied as 0.6µg/g-19.5mg/g. The value of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was higher than saturated fatty acids (SFA). Total PUFA and eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) were observed as 37.2 and 7.2%, respectively. These values corresponded to the values of 673.3 and 123.2 mg/100g of the edible portion of the soup within the same respect. The results of this study demonstrated that a portion of trout soup would almost cover daily recommended n-3 PUFA intake, however, higher amounts are required for the necessary levels of EPA+DHA. The vitamin B12 content was well above the recommended levels. The values of α and β tocopherols were observed as 272.0 and 1131.0 µg/100g (wwb), respectively. This study indicates that trout soup has a good nutritional value for human consumption for a healthy diet.

Makale Başlığı: Snow Fighting on Railway Lines
Özet: With this study, it is aimed to investigate the fight against snow on railway lines. In this study; Types of snow according to the snow covering the road on the railways, snow removal methods to be chosen in the railway according to the situation of covering the snowfall on the railway for the railway traffic to be operated without interruption, snow trenches and types manufactured to protect the railway from snow, the front of the snow trench according to whether the snow trenches are full or perforated. and the ways of collecting snow are discussed. Statistical information should be kept in order to determine the places that are most exposed to snow closure on the main lines, and the places where snow trenches will be made should be determined and snow trenches should be built in this direction. It is thought that it would be beneficial to prefer natural snow shields as snow shields, as both construction and long-term maintenance costs are low, as well as very good results in snow fighting. It is seen that the number of scientific and academic works at the national level in the field of rail transportation in our country is low, and it is thought that this study will contribute to the literature.

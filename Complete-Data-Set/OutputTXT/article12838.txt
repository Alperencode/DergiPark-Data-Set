Makale Başlığı: Articles by Salih Zeki: A Preliminary Bibliographic Study
Özet: In this study, the bibliography of articles by the Turkish historian of science and educator Salih Zeki (1864–1921) was examined as part of a research project that took place between 2018 and 2021. First, we reviewed the literature that introduced and evaluated the works of Salih Zeki. Next, we classified Salih Zeki’s articles by chronological order, topic, and periodical title. Salih Zeki’s 30 years of contribution to the literary field were further divided into three periods as a result of this classification. The first period (1889–1896) focused on the history of mathematics and astronomy. In the second period (1896–1908), he wrote mostly on scientific subjects related to geology, meteorology, astronomy, and physics, while serving as the director of the Ottoman Imperial Observatory. In the third period (1908–1921), he wrote on both arts and humanities subjects (e.g., education, logic, and philosophy), as well as administrative issues (e.g., the regulation of official time and calendarfor statistical offices). Together, these three periods of literary contribution across a variety of subjects suggest that Salih Zeki, while being a competent historian of science, was evidently one of the most influential intellectuals of his time.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Soil and Climatic Properties of Riva Mullein (Verbascum bugulifolium Lam.) Species
Özet: Rivasığırkuyruğu / Riva mullein (Verbascum bugulifolium Lam.) is a rare plant of Turkey belonging to the Euro-Siberian phytogeographic region. In this study, populations of the species in 12 different locations in Kırklareli province were examined and soil characteristics plus the topographic and climatic characteristics of the distribution area were investigated. In light of the analyzed data, it has been concluded that V. bugulifolium grows in soils that are low in lime and magnesium values, moderate in pH, salinity, potassium and calcium values, and high in organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc and manganese. It has been determined that the species generally spreads in areas where the slope is low (x= 4.16%) and close to sea level (x= 70.5 m). In terms of climatic characteristics, the ̄ species is more prevalent in temperate climates and in regions that receive precipitation in almost every season. Additionally, it has been observed that the habitats that favor the growth of the species are forest clearings, dry heath, and acidic rocks, especially forest clearings where oak species are predominant. The objective of this study is to form a basis for studies to be carried out for the monitoring, protection (in-situ and ex-situ), and sustainability of V. bugulifolium, which is a rare species in our country.

Makale Başlığı: China and the Alternative Charms of 21st Century’s New World Order: How China is ‎Reshaping their Non-Western Model of ‎Soft Power
Özet: Soft power is the frame of attraction that can be achieved without force. The strategy of soft ‎power mainly proliferated and rationally employed by the west as a policy approach of their ‎liberal hegemonic face. Though since the last two decades, the west’s liberal faces are declining ‎and the new challenging appearances are coming from the east, especially from China. China ‎was used to ‎follow the methods of the western style of international relations to overcome their ‎superiority. In ‎that case, China was used to highlight the “cooperative policy” to modernize ‎their policy ‎related to international relations, custom service, and international law. To make ‎China as ‎‎“powerful” nation, they aimed to introduce the Chinese version of foreign relations ‎and soft ‎power model where “use barbarians to control barbarians” was a gradual process into ‎the progression ‎of modernization. However, the query is which Chinese model of soft power ‎will introduce China’s strategies in shaping the future new world order. This paper seeks to find ‎out whether and how scholars and policymakers ‎distinguish China’s soft power concept and ‎how soft power has been framed in the ‎literature and academia of China apart from the concept ‎of western soft power. Finally, this study assesses whether China ‎shows a new paradigm to ‎identify the power concept in comparison with its frontiers of the West. ‎

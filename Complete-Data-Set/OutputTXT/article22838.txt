Makale Başlığı: THE CONGO’S APPEARANCE OF POST-COLONIALISM: THE CONGO CRISIS IN THE CLAMP OF COLD WAR
Özet: Democratic Republic of Congo became a colony of Belgium after the Berlin Conference held in 1885. Gaining independence in 1960 was not enough to erase the traces of the colonial period in the country. Some of the colonial powers like Belgium and the USA, who wanted to continue to benefit from Congo’s rich natural resources and its strategic location in Africa, eliminated Prime Minister Patrice Emery Lumumba, who was elected through democratic elections, and his legitimate government, in order to keep their control over the territory. The crisis, which initially ocurred between Congo and Belgium due to colonialism, became internationalized under the influence of the Cold War, and the United Nations (UN) which intervened in the region to solve the problem in favor of the colonial powers and left the country in the middle of fragilities, instability, and problems that stil exist even today. The purpose of the study is to examine the causes, breaking points, and the consequences of the Congo crisis, in which the Cold War, colonialism, and Congo’s internal dynamics are interwined, the attidues of international actors and the reflections of the crisis to today. As it makes a comprehensive analysis of the effects of colonialism and the Cold War on Congo, and Lumumba’s struggle for independence, in the context of internal and external dynamics, this study might be beneficial in terms of understanding the crisis itself. This study analyses the situation in Congo from the Post-Colonialist point of view, moreover qualitative research methods and content analysis are used.

Makale Başlığı: Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Applications in Pain Management in Pediatric Patients: A Systematic Review
Özet: Purpose: This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality applications in pain management on pediatric patients. Method: Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science databases were scanned to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality applications in pain management on pediatric patients. The keywords; "pediatric", "pain management", "virtual reality", "randomized controlled" were used during the scanning phase. Results: "1236" studies on the subject were reached by the database search. In the study, a preliminary evaluation was made according to the title and abstract, and 1218 studies were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria were obtained from four databases, and the number of articles included in the evaluation was found to be 11. Since 1 article is paid access, the full text could not be accessed and 10 articles were excluded from the research and evaluated in terms of comparison and results. The 10 studies included in the evaluation are randomized controlled studies published between 2015 and 2020, in which pediatric patients constitute the sample group. In 10 studies evaluated, the results of the use of virtual reality as a non-pharmacological method in pediatric patients and to be an effective tool for pain relief have been revealed.Practice Implications: It is recommended to use virtual reality application as a non-pharmacological method to relieve pain in pediatric patients and to include them in nursing practices by following the innovations in the field.

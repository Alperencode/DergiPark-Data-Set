Makale Başlığı: THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON OF COLONIALISM: WRONG UNDERSTANDING OF RIGHT AND POWER
Özet: The concept of right is as old as human history. It has been recorded in the holy books of monotheistic religions that the first fight in human history, among the children of Adam (pbuh), sprouted around the concept of right. It can be said that this concept, which seems difficult to define, has emerged not only for the individual himself but also appears at many stages of social life and often constitutes the anchor point for individuals to reach their goals. Not only individuals but also societies are focusing on solutions around the concept of rights in order to reach a conclusion that is satisfactory for all parties. In contrast to this worldview where the concept of right is uphold, there is a second worldview that upholds the concept of power and puts the civilisations it has under control into a confrontational mode. In this worldview the one with power has authority and views itself entitled to shape the laws that govern social life. Throughout history we see that these two worldviews followed each other like day and night. Colonialism, which is considered a shame of history of humanity and brought with it the enslavement of millions of people, continues in different forms even though it is not accepted today. Neo-colonialism in the guise of imperialism is essentially nothing but the manifestation of a wrong understanding of right and power. This study focuses on the connection between colonialism and a wrong understanding of right and power.

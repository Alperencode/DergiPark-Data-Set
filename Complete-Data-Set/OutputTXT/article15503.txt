Makale Başlığı: COMPARISON OF OIL CONTENT AND FATTY ACIDS COMPOSITION OF SESAME (Sesamum indicum L.) VARIETIES GROWN AS MAIN AND DOUBLE CROP IN MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT IN TURKEY
Özet: This study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons at the Experimental This study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons at the Experimental area of Cukurova University, Faculty of Agriculture as a main and double crop in Mediterranean region (Adana, Turkey). The objective of the study was to compare of oil conten and fatty acids composition of sesame varieties grown as a main and double crop. The experimental design was a Randomized Complete Block with three replications. Arslanbey, Batem-Aksu, Batem-Uzun, Baydar-2001, Boydak, Cumhuriyet-99, Gölmarmara, Hatipoglu, Kapsut-99, Muganlı-57, Orhangazi-57, Osmanlı-99, Özberk-82, Sarısu, Tan-99, Tanas and Sarı Susam were used as a plant material in this study. These varieties were registered by the different Research Institutes and Faculties in Turkey. Oil content and fatty acids composition (oleic acid, linoleic acid, stearik acid and palmitic acid) of sesame varieties were investigated and compared in main and double crop growing seasons.The results showed that the considerable variation was found in oil content and fatty acids composition among the sesame varieties grown in main and double crop growing seasons. Oil content, palmitic and oleic acid percentage of the sesame varieties were higher in main crop than in double crop growing season whereas, stearic and linoleic acid percentage of the sesame varieties were found higher in double crop than in main crop growing season.

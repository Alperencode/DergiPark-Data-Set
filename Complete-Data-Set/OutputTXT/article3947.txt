Makale Başlığı: THE POLITICAL THEORY OF JOHANNES ALTHUSIUS AS A CONTRARY APPROACH TO THE DOMINANT MODERN STATE PARADIGM
Özet: After being neglected for a long time, the political theory of Johannes Althusius (1557-1638) has become a subject of scientific curiosity. In recent years, increasing criticism of the dominant modern state tradition and paradigm and the demands of sub-state communities for recognition and rights have aroused great interest in Althusius’ theory as an alternative approach. Althusius, whose life coincided with a time of radical and major change –the transition from medieval to the modern age– is a very little studied political theorist today compared to his peer thinkers. Althusius developed extensive thoughts on the basics of political theory such as the term ‘politics’, associations and society, social contract, state, sovereignty, right of resistance, federalism, and religion-state relationship as interrelated issues. These themes are the main issues that keep maintaining their importance and are still discussed in state and political theory. This study focuses on Althusius’ political theory as a whole within itself and aims to analyze this theory. This analysis does not consist solely of a monolithic method; it also compares Althusius’ theory with some other thinkers whose thoughts shaped the dominant approach to the modern state.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of longitudinal studies in science education in terms of methodological characteristics
Özet: Studies conducted to examining scientific research published in the field of science education are important in terms of contributing to the recognition of the methodological features that are frequently or limitedly preferred in related studies. From such factors, longitudinal studies are limited studies due to cost and long duration. In this study, longitudinal studies on science education were examined in terms of methodological features, year of publication, philosophical basis, data collection technique, number of participants, target group and data collection process. In the research, which was carried out in accordance with the qualitative study approach, the relevant researches carried out in Turkey from 2004 to 2021 were examined by document analysis. The results reveal that no longitudinal studies have been carried out for science education from the second half of 2020 to 2021. For the 21 longitudinal studies discussed, it can be stated that it is not carried out with secondary school students, who are among the target groups of science education. In addition, it has been determined that more place is given to pre-service teachers who continue their education in the relevant field and the teachers and teachers as the target participants  in these studies. These results may offer some perspectives on how researchers working in the related field can identify the target group in their longitudinal research and how they can combine research processes and new opportunities provided by technology.

Makale Başlığı: A bibliometric analysis of total quality method literature in tourism for the last 19 years
Özet: The main objectives of Total Quality Management (TQM), which first emerged in 1950 in Japan with the contributions of Japanese pioneers of quality philosophy such as Deming and Juran, are expressed as continuous quality improvement, training and customer satisfaction in a business. The essence of the philosophy of Total Quality Management (TQM) is to ensure final customer satisfaction at every stage and fulfill customer needs accordingly. As a system that guarantees the targeted quality in an enterprise, Total Quality Management (TQM) continues to develop in the production sector as well as the service sector. The tourism industry, which is a labor-intensive industry, is being evaluated among sectors that are most affected by intense competition between businesses and countries. Therefore, Total Quality Management (TQM) is an extremely important factor in terms of the competitiveness of destinations and tourism businesses in the global market. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to reveal the change and development process within the last 19 years of studies dealing with the concepts of "Total Quality Management and Tourism" together in detail in international literature. Therefore, a bibliometric profile of the strong relationship between Total Quality Management and Tourism was established with the CiteSpace analysis method by using the variables deployed in previous studies, the methods used in the analyzes, and the obtained findings.

Makale Başlığı: Web 2.0 Tools in Chemistry Teaching: An Analysis of Pre-Service Chemistry Teachers’ Competencies and Views
Özet: This research aimed to explore the competencies of the pre-service chemistry teachers (PSCTs) to use Web 2.0 tools and their views on these tools in the context of chemistry teaching. A descriptive design was used. The participants were 27 PSCTs studying at the Department of Chemistry Education at a state university in Turkey. Data were collected through Web 2.0 Tools Usage Competence Scale and Structured Interview Form. The results demonstrated that the PSCTs were moderately competent in using Web 2.0 tools. The majority of them experienced these tools for the first time within the framework of this study and had no prior expertise. The interview results showed that the PSCTs thought that most chemistry subjects are difficult to comprehend due to their abstract sense, and that any subject can be taught more successfully using Web 2.0 tools to visualize it as a comics or animation. Considering the results, it was suggested that pre-service teachers and teachers could acquire knowledge and competencies in Web 2.0 technologies by organizing various projects, workshops and in-service trainings.

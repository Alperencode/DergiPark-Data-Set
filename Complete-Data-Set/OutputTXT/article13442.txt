Makale Başlığı: CATECHIC TANNIN CONTENT OF DIFFERENT TEA SAMPLES
Özet: Objective: Camellia sinensis (tea) which is a member of the Theaceae family can be found in many tropical and subtropical areas with diverse cultural forms. It is grown only in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey and originated from China and Japan and is defined as a small evergreen tree. White, green, and black teas are all made from the Camellia sinensis plant species. Scientific studies have shown that distinct types of tea have emerged because of different fermentation processes in the production stages. In this study, the macroscopic and microscopic analysis, diagnosis of tannin, and catechical tannin determination have been conducted on fifteen Camellia sinensis samples purchased from various places. Material and Methods: Five grams of powdered tea samples were extracted with 50 ml of hot water and the catechical tannin determination in the extracts was made by gelatin, ferric and stiasny tests.Results: In the macroscopical examination of A-E (white, green, and black) tea samples the researchers observed no color, odor, or any other substance. When all the samples were microscopically examined, reaserch detected the presence of idioblast which is the characteristic structure of the tea.Conclusion: There was a positive result regarding a diagnosis of tannin and catechical tannin. Catechin substances were determined in each of the one gram samples; The E white tea 0,1300 g, green tea 0,1500 g, black tea 0,0693 g; the D white tea 0,1889 g, green tea 0,1228 g, black tea 0,0710 g; the C white tea 0,2118 g, green tea 0,1306 g, black tea 0,0436 g; the A white tea 0,2400 g, green tea 0,1972 g, black tea 0,0686 g; the B white tea 0,3317 g, green tea 0,1380 g, black tea 0,0517 g.

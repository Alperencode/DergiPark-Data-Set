Makale Başlığı: Development of Financial Literacy Scale for Children: Validity and Reliability Studies
Özet: The aim of the present study was to develop a valid and reliable “Financial Literacy Scale” for children. Data were derived from 408 grade four students (Mage=10.04, sd=.526) who completed the scale form completely. Participants ages were ranging from 9 to 12, and almost half of them (n= 200, 49%) were girls. The sample was randomly split into two different sub-samples (sample 1, n = 204; sample 2, n = 204). Sample 1 was used to perform exploratory factor analysis (EFA) while sample 2 used for confirming the structure obtained. As a result of EFA, a two-factor structure (financial management and conscious consumption) comprising 24 items was obtained.    Both factors explain 58.24% of the total variance. To ensure reliability of the scale, Cronbach’s Alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated, and the half-split reliability method was utilized. As a result of the analysis, the Cronbach's Alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated as .95, the Guttman coefficient as .91 and the Spearman-Brown coefficient as .92. Perfect and near-perfect fit index values were obtained from the model established by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). These results show that the developed “Financial Literacy Scale for Children” is a valid and reliable measurement tool and can be used to evaluate children's financial literacy skills.

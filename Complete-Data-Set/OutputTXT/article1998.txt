Makale Başlığı: Records of Assistance to Sports Branches in İzmir’s Public Houses (1940-1949)
Özet: The establishment of public houses revealed the fact that Mustafa Kemal Pasha was an important man of thought and ideas, as well as his political and military abilities. Halkevleri was started as a work of Mustafa Kemal Pasha on February 19, 1932. The public houses, which continued their activities until 1951, were divided into 9 branches within themselves. One of the important branches of public houses, which consists of Language-History, Literature, Fine Arts, Representation, Sports, Legal Aid, Public Classrooms and Courses, Library and Neşriyat, Villagers, Museum and Exhibition branches, is the sports branch. The aim of this study is to reveal the activities of the sports branch carried out with state support by showing examples of Izmir Central and district public houses. Menemen Karsiyaka, Izmir Central, Bornova, Bayındır, Pergamon, Ödemiş, Selçuk, Buca, Tire and Menemen public houses will be presented with a detailed breakdown of the assistance provided in the study. The basis of the study is based on the documents obtained from the Republican Archive of the Presidium of the State Archives of the Republic of Turkey.

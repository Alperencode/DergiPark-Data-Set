Özet: Ibnulemin Mahmut Kemal Inal’s autobiography Kendime Dair (About Myself), contains information about his birth, family, education, working life, literary personality, and works. Ibnulemin’s autobiography covers the period of the major wars that determined the fate of the Turkish state, the constitutional monarchy, the War of Independence, and the Republican Period. His remarkable text reflects the subjective world and emotional state of the author alongside the political, social, and cultural characteristics of the time. From an individual perspective, Kendime Dair contains information on the author’s self-definition, his emotional states, and pivotal events that represent breaking points in his life. Meanwhile, from a socio-cultural and ideological perspective, it comments on the censorship exercised over the press, the bureaucratic structures of the time, and the issue of “Unionism.” Through textual analysis, this article seeks to investigate Kendime Dair from both individuals and social, cultural, and ideological perspectives. Particular attention is given to the author's autobiographical memory, inner world, mood, position in his social and intellectual environment, and career.

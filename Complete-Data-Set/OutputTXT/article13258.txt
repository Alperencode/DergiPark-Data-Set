Makale Başlığı: Religious Tendency of Muslims Living in Kosovo
Özet: The Republic of Kosovo is the country with the highest Muslim population in the Balkan Peninsula. Although there are people with different ethnic and religious beliefs living in Kosovo, Muslim Albanians are in the majority. Even though the country experienced many different problems after the Ottoman period, it seems that in terms of both ethnic and religious beliefs the society is still in a strong standing. Because, even there is no official study on this subject, some studies carried out by non-governmental organizations and survey centers conclude that 95% of the population of Kosovo are Muslim. This study will determine the religious tendencies of Kosovo Muslims. In addition, I will determine the relationship between religiosity and gender, marital status, place of residence, and income. The study is a field research in which I used the survey technique following the scanning method. The sample consists of Muslim individuals (N=319) living in Kosovo. According to the findings, the study observed that there was a significant difference between gender and religious belief, the living space and religious worship, knowledge and religious behavior and morality, income status and religiosity, and between all dimensions. However, I didn’t find a significant difference in terms of marital status.

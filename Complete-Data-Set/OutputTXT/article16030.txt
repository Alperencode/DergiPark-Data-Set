Makale Başlığı: On Orhan Pamuk’s Novel Theory
Özet: In this study, the main topics in Orhan Pamuk’s theory of novel are examined. The Naive and The Sentimental Novelist (2010) is employed to distinguish several philosophical and literary problems: the cognitive value of the novel, relations between the novel and painting, the novel’s composition, and the way in which the protagonist has been conceptualized. The authors concluded there are numerous thoughts on the relationships between specific fields of art, ontology of the fictional genres, and reception theory in Orhan Pamuk’s work. The main purpose of this article was to examine the theory underlying Pamuk’s work and to present new research fields involving the Turkish writer’s reflections.

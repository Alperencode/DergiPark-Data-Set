Makale Başlığı: PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN VALUES EDUCATION AND SOLUTION SUGGESTIONS
Özet: Values are the opinions, feelings, importance, principles or beliefs, which are adopted by most of a social group or society members and considered right and necessary to sustain the existence, adaptation and process. Values are motives that steer the behaviors. Values are the goals that organize the social living in many areas. It is important and necessary for individuals to indigenize the values and convert them into behaviors for the existence, order and continuation of that society. Non-transmission, negligence and non-adoption of the values, which give the society its identity, cause social corruption and this is one of the most significant signs of the downfall. As of the twentieth century, rapid development and change in science and technology and several negative situations induced by these changes have seriously influenced the societies. This period has both resulted in positive developments and caused rapidly increasing social problems in societies, and it continues to cause those problems. These problems, which we often witness in the world and in our country, indicate the corruption of the values that determine the social and ethical standards. This is caused by the difficulties experienced in building these values formally and informally. In other words, the intended goals can’t be achieved. In this study, emphasis will be set on the problems with the adoption of the values and their conversion into behaviors and the causes of these problems; solution suggestions will be proposed in light of experimental researches for an effective values education.

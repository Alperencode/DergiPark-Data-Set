Makale Başlığı: Relationships between Opercular Girth and Maximum Girth, Total Weight, Total Length of Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda Bloch, 1793), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus Linnaeus, 1758) and Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789) from Gallipoli Peninsula (Northern Aegean Sea, Turkey)
Özet: This study was carried out using dead fishes caught by commercial fishermen of Gallipoli Peninsula (northern Aegean Sea, Turkey)to find out length-girth and length-weight relationships of atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda Bloch, 1793), atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus Linnaeus, 1758) and atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789) between January 2017 and December 2017. The length-weight relationships were estimated as W=0.0143TL2.84 (R2=0.89), W=0.0059TL3.11 (R2=0.92) and W=0.0059TL3.11 (R2=0.92) for Sarda sarda, Scomber scombrus and Scomber colias, respectively. The length-opercular girth relationships were calculated as Gope=0.3988TL+0.2512 (R2=0.78), Gope=0.3528TL+0.8122 (R2=0.84) and Gope=0.4295TL-0.5991 (R2=0.94), whereas the length-maximum girth relationships were determined to be Gmax=0.5993TL-4.1237 (R2=0.79), Gmax=0.4206TL+0.2732 (R2=0.83) and Gmax=0.4676TL-0.168 for Sarda sarda, Scomber scombrus and Scomber colias, respectively. The present study includes preliminary information on length-opercular girth and length-maximum girth relationships of these fish species for the Mediterranean Basin including Black Sea.

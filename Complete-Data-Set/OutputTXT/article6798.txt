Makale Başlığı: A BIBLIOMETRIC AND SCIENTIFIC MAPPING ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH ON INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS FROM 1991 TO 2021
Özet: This study aims to examine the scientific production dynamics of the institutional logic approach between the years 1991-2021. For this purpose, we have searched 15 journals with the highest impact rate in management and organization, and we have examined 235 studies in line with the inclusion criteria. We have used VOSviewer software to reveal the dynamics of scientific production and the SciMAT software for the scientific mapping of the themes. When we examine the dynamics of the scientific output, we have found that the USA has the most publications. The most active journal is Organizational Studies, and the most cited author is Michael Lounsbury. We have investigated the historical development of the themes within the scope of institutional logics (1991-2001; 2002-2012; 2013-2021). We have found that seven main themes were in the first period, 17 in the second period, and 52 in the last period. Despite the increase in the number of themes, it is a prominent finding that these themes reflect temporary research trends. In this context, we detect that the researchers have only examined the theme of "institutional change" in all three periods. We interpret this situation as the midlife crisis of institutional logics, and we have suggestions to overcome this problem for future research.

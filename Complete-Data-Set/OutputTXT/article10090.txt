Makale Başlığı: REFLECTIONS OF DISSOLUTION PROCESS OF THE SOVIET UNION TO TURKIC REPUBLICS: PERIODS AND DYNAMICS OF CHANGE
Özet: After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's "Central Garden" called the "back garden" even today, "Were they independent? or were they left independent?” rhetoric still has its effect. In this study, based on the discourse in question, the policies implemented in the process the reflections of these policies on the 3 Turkic Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan) in the political, economic and cultural fields are examined. As a result of the examinations carried out, in this study, first of all, the policies implemented by the republics that wanted to integrate into the new system were tried to be analyzed in an integrated manner. With the politics of the Turkic Republic within the framework of De-Sovietization and De-Russianization, the process of building a new nation has been examined. Although independence was attributed to the independence by these republics after independence, when all these processes were examined, conclusions supporting the discourse that they were left independent were reached. However, this independence has been made more meaningful with the analysis. In addition, the study, which has a unique nature due to bringing together the scattered issues in the literature about the independence of the Turkic Republics, aims to add a new perspective to the reader in this regard.

Makale Başlığı: Trichodinid ectoparasites (Ciliophora: Peritrichida) from gills of some marine fishes of Sinop Coasts of the Black Sea, with the first report of Trichodina rectuncinata
Özet: Four species of marine fishes, turbot Scophthalmus maeoticus, common sole Solea solea, shore rockling Gaidropsarus mediterraneus, and rusty blenny Parablennius sanguinolentus from Sinop coasts of the Black Sea were examined for ectoparasitic trichodinids. A total of four trichodinid species, Trichodina rectuncinata, T. ovonucleata, T. jadranica, and T. domerguei were described using the silver nitrate impregnation technique and morphologically studied. All morphometric data and photomicrographs of these trichodinids were presented along with details of their host preferences, prevalence and intensity of infestation. This study is the first report on the trichodinid ectoparasites on Scophthalmus maeoticus, Solea solea, Gaidropsarus mediterraneus, and Parablennius sanguinolentus in Türkiye. Moreover Trichodina rectuncinata is as a new record for Turkish fish parasite fauna.

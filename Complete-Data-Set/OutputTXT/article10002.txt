Makale Başlığı: Contribution to Knowledge on The Anatomy of The Genus Noccaea Moench (Brassicaceae) From Türkiye
Özet: The anatomical properties of Noccaea camlikensis and N. cariensis were determined in this study. The roots have a secondary root type. The stem cross-sections have a single-layered epidermis, parenchymatous cortex, one layered distinct endodermis, vascular bundles with sclerenchymatic caps, and parenchymatic pith cells. Equifacial and bifacial mesophyll types are observed in the leaves, with multiple-layered palisade tissue, and the spongy parenchyma is well-developed. Vascular bundles are small in the leaves except in the leaf midrib. Anisocytic stomata type are observed in the surface sections. The assessment of anatomical characteristics of the studied Noccaea species, such as the number of cortex in the stem and the shape of midvein of leaf, are of taxonomical value.

Makale Başlığı: Can the Contribution of the “Principled Negotiation” Approach to Corporate Communication Be Measured? Negotiation Index Model
Özet: Harvard Negotiation Model, as one of the most important conceptual models in negotiation, introduced the "Principled Negotiation" developed by Fisher and Ury (1981). However, there is no criterion that reveals the extent to which the Principled Negotiation can be applied. In this study, it is aimed to develop an Index to determine to what extent the negotiations are conducted “on the basis of principles”. The contribution of negotiation competence to corporate communication is quantified. The Negotiation Index Model was created based on Fisher and Ury (1981) using the The Balance Method. The Model provides an objective measure of the extent to which the negotiating parties have adopted the Principled Negotiation, and provides a perspective for improving the negotiation process.

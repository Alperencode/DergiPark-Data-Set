Makale Başlığı: BIO-CLIMATIC DESIGN IN HISTORICAL BUILDINGS: ANKARA GARANTI BANK REVIEW
Özet: Bioclimatic design is an efficient architectural approach to improve thermal comfort, save energy and reduce the carbon footprint of buildings. This approach is based on creating a partially or wholly passive building. Many of the historical buildings are among the good examples where many bioclimatic design methods were applied due to the lack of technology in the period they were built. However, the increase in energy consumption in our age has disrupted the user comfort and energy balance system of these buildings. This situation has revealed the necessity of rehabilitating actively used and culturally valuable buildings for energy consumption and user comfort.Every historic building is unique and the design criteria to be applied in renovation projects must acknowledge this individuality. The application of climatic architectural criteria in historical building conservation approaches will yield fruitful results by evaluating and analyzing these criteria separately for each building. Compared to abroad, the number of studies and applications carried out in our country is very low. This study, which was carried out according to qualitative research methods, aims to create healthy, sustainable and energy-efficient spaces in existing buildings with cultural value by using bioclimatic design methods; emphasizes the importance of prioritizing nature and user comfort in this process. In conclusion, this article reveals how bioclimatic design criteria can be applied to historical buildings in our country through Garanti Bank.

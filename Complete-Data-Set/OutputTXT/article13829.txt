Makale Başlığı: Grave Stones in the Naval Museum Command
Özet: Gravestones, which are one of the important reflections of Turkish-Islamic art, are a part of cultural heritage and provide information about the periods they belonged to with their forms, text contents, ornaments and headgear. Each information obtained reveals the burial tradition, culture, style, writing character and interaction of that period. The 16 grave heads that are the subject of the study and exhibited in the Istanbul Naval Museum Command today were evaluated. First of all, after giving a brief information about the history of the museum, which was founded in 1897 during the reign of II. Abdulhamid and which was the most important Naval Museum in Anatolia, the tombstones in the museum inventory were examined. It was observed that 12 of the gravestones belonged to janissaries, and the stones were completed with a headgear of “börk”, “dardağan” and “serdengeçti”. In addition, the symbols of the troops to which the janissaries belong were also identified. One of the other 4 tombstones has a turmeric cone used by those from Has Oda or Enderun, while three do not have a title. In the last part, the gravestones and their symbols were evaluated and compared with similar examples in Anatolia and their place in gravestones was tried to be revealed.

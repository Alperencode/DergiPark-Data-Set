Makale Başlığı: Idioms in Kyrgyz Turkic that Refer to Men and Idioms that Male-Related Words Refer to
Özet: While sex is the state of being a woman or a man acquired by birth; gender is the identity of being male or female. Behaviors and roles that are separated from each other by the stereotypes that develop around biological gender constitute a person's 'gender identity'. When it comes to gender, whether it is considered from an academic or a popular point of view, the first thing that comes to mind is ingrained women's studies. However, masculinity studies, which have attracted increasing attention in recent years, should not be ignored. In this research, which we think will contribute to the studies of masculinity in the academic field, the idiom has been chosen as the main material. Idioms showing cultural richness are stereotypes that consist of at least two vocabulary and are often reinforced with a figurative meaning other than their literal meaning. Idioms that can carry the lifestyles of societies and the value judgments in many fields from many years ago to the present are of cultural heritage value. In this study, in which the idioms determined from the work of "Kırgız Tilinin Frazeologiyalık Sözdüğü" are examined, the perspective of the society on the Kyrgyz Turkic men from the past to the present, the reflection of masculinity in the idioms, and the male profile in the idioms are tried to be revealed.

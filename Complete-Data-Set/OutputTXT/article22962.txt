Makale Başlığı: Updating Distribution of Atriplex Taxa in Turkey According to Herbaria Records
Özet: The aim of this study was to update the distribution information of Atriplex taxa distributed in Turkey according to the specimens deposited in national herbaria. According to Flora of Turkey, Atriplex taxa distribute in 28 provinces and 62 localities. It is seen that this number increases to 238 localities in 48 provinces in total when the herbarium records are added. Distribution maps of Atriplex taxa according to provinces were provided, and it is clearly shown that different herbarium records increase knowledge about the distribution areas of the taxa.

Makale Başlığı: Sign of Culture, Class and Status: Plate
Özet: While serving and eating the food, an item on the plate decorates our tables together with the kitchen utensils it has. In addition to the basic function that plates fulfill, it is seen that they are a hierarchical separation and stratification tool in the society by being identified by people from different cultures, belonging to different status and class, together with visual and objective elements. The meanings attributed by the society as a result of identification have transformed the plate into a communication tool by going beyond being a kitchen utensil. This meaning, which is the product of the culture formed in the society, has led people to associate their preferences with objects as a part of the communication process. This study, which is prepared to find the meaning attributed to the plate, deals with the plate in the culinary culture in history and draws attention to the parallelism of the meaning attributed by class and status and consumption preferences.

Makale Başlığı: Development of Sustainable Event Awareness Scale: Validity and Reliability Study
Özet: This research was conducted with the aim of developing a measurement tool that measures the sustainable event awareness of individuals participating in sports activities. An item pool was created with the literature, expert opinions and field workers. This research group consisted of trainers, athletes, physical education and sports teachers, referees, sports managers and technical staff in Turkey who participated in national and international sports events. 812 volunteers participated in this research. Data was collected with Google Forms. It is a descriptive study designed according to the general scanning model. Explanatory and confirmatory factor analyzes were conducted for the scale called “Sustainable Event Awareness Scale” (SEAS). As a result of the analysis, 24 items with construct validity were included in the final scale. It has been determined that the scale is gathered under a total of four factors: support, performance evaluation, system structure and processes. The Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be .936 for the entire scale, and it was concluded that the scale was reliable and that the scale, which has a four-dimensional structure, measures the targeted features in all sub-dimensions and is valid. As a result, this scale, which has been developed, can be used as a valid and reliable scale that measures the features that are desired to be measured in accordance with the purpose of the research.

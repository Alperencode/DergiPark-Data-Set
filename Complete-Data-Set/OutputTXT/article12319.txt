Makale Başlığı: A Bibliometric Analysis of the International Social Capital Studies
Özet: Social capital, which has been the subject of many researches recently and actually has a longer conceptual history, is based on trust, social networks and norms and is important for both communication and human well-being. In this study, it is primarily aimed to examine the general lines of social capital and to analyze the articles in the field of "social capital" with the bibliometric analysis method. The data required in the analysis were accessed from the Web of Science database, covering all years (1975-2021) and applying special filters (article, business, management, economics). VOSviewer (1.6.16) program was used in data analysis and the findings were visualized. Findings were presented in 5 categories: "authors with the most publications", "institutions with the most publications", "resources with the most publications", "countries with the most publications" and "most used keywords". In addition, the distribution of “social capital” studies by years, languages and types from the special analysis section of the Web of Science database has been added to the study. The study is important because it underlines the important points in the literature with the literature review and analysis findings.

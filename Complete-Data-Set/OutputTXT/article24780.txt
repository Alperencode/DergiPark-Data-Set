Özet: Environmental factors play an important role in allergic sensitization. The aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of aeroallergen sensitivity of patients. The skin prick test results of patients with symptoms compatible with allergic diseases between March 2002 and December 2004 were retrospectively evaluated in Gaziantep University Pulmonary outpatient clinic. Of 1627 patients in whom skin prick tests (Stallergenes, France) were performed, 528 (32.5%) patients had at least one positive result among 8 allergens. The mean age of patients who had positive allergic skin test was 33.03 ± 11.80 (16-69), and 335 (63.4%) of those were female. Two hundred twenty five (52%) patients had positive skin prick test for one allergen tested, while 253 (48%) patients had positive skin prick test for multiple allergens. Phleum pratensis was the most common allergen found to be positive in 221 (41.8%) patients. The prevalence of positive tests were as follows; cockroach (32.9%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (32.7%), Olea europea (27%), cat dander (14.9%), Parieteria officinalis (11.7%), Cladosporium (9.8%) and Alternaria (8.9%).Phleum pratensis and cockroach were the most common allergens causing a sensitivity reaction detected in our clinic.

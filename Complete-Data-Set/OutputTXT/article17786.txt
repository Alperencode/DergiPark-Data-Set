Makale Başlığı: Determination of Shear Wave Velocity Structure by Using Inversion of Horizontal/Vertical Spectral Ratios Obtained from Earthquake Records: Example from the East of Lake Van
Özet: The eastern part of the Lake Van region has a high potential to produce destructive earthquakes due to the presence of active faults with different mechanisms. To evaluate the damages of earthquakes, it is well known the physical properties of the underground and its behavior during the earthquake. Determination of the depth-dependent shear wave velocity variation and bedrock depth is extremely important in this respect. In this study, nine earthquakes data that occurred on different types of fault between 2011-2021 in the east of the Lake Van region are used. 6 station earthquake data is analyzed using the H/V spectral ratio and the Monte-Carlo inversion, and the shear wave velocity structure and bedrock depths are calculated. The low-frequency values are relatively defined depending on the thickness of the alluvial units under the stations, whilst the presence of different rock units increases the frequency values. The peaks at different frequencies in the spectral ratio curves show variability depending on the characteristics of the geological structure. The bedrock depth under the station is between 10-350 m. Increasing bedrock depth levels are a factor that increases the damage rate of destructive earthquakes.

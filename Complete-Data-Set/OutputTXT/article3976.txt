Makale Başlığı: The Analysis of Climate Change Awareness at Local Level in Bilecik
Özet: With the growing interest in renewable energy systems, studies on the sustainability of small-scale wind turbines have been published in recent years. A literature review was conducted in this study to compile scientific studies conducted to evaluate the environmental effects of medium and small-sized wind energy systems using the life cycle assessment. Life cycle assessment is a method of evaluating the environmental sustainability of a product, process, or system that is becoming more important in the context of decisions and policies in the energy sector. The environmental effects of medium and small-sized wind turbines on the life cycle size have been investigated in this study, which looked at studies conducted since 2004. The vast majority of these studies conducted environmental sustainability assessments based solely on a few environmental impact indicators such as global warming potential. There are only a few studies that consider a wider range of environmental effects. The collection and analysis of studies examining the life cycle environmental sustainability of medium and small-scale wind turbines are important for determining the future vision of small-scale energy production systems.

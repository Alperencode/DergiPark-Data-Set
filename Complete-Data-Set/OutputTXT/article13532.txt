Makale Başlığı: Characterization Of Jute/Aramid Hybrid Composite Materials with Using Different Resins
Özet: For the last twenty to thirty years, interest in the use of hybrid fiber-reinforced composites has gradually increased due to their potential for various applications. The balanced strength and stiffness properties of hybrid composites, along with the advantages of lighter weight and lower cost, have made them an important step toward replacing traditional materials. In this study, a hybrid composite was made from a combination of Jute fabric from natural fibers, Aramid fabric from synthetic fibers, and two different resins (polyester and vinylester). This type of study was proposed because there is little research in the literature on how the use of polyester and vinyl ester resins affects the mechanical properties of homogeneous composites and hybrid composites. The vacuum assisted resin transfer molding process was used for the fabrication. The mechanical properties of the manufactured products were determined by tensile and hardness tests, and their morphological structures were examined by taking scanning electron microscope images. The results indicate that the value of tensile strength and elastic modulus of the Jute/Aramid hybrid samples in the productions prepared with polyester resin is 37.6% and %12.28, respectively, higher than in those made with vinyl ester resin. When comparing the values for microhardness, the results of the Jute/Aramid hybrid specimens produced with polyester resin were 1.20 times higher than those produced with vinyl ester resin. Scanning electron microscope images of the samples also clearly show that the bonding between matrix and fiber is better in polyester resin samples.

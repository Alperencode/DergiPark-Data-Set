Makale Başlığı: Grave Steles with Symposion (Banquet) Scenes from the Ephesus Museum
Özet: In the study of the article, six grave steles with a funerary meal/symposium scene in the Ephesus Museum are studied. The aim of the study is to understand the typology of the grave stele production of the city of Ephesos and to determine the interaction area, as well as bringing the previously unpublished works to the literature. In this sense, stelae have been studied primarily by examining types, figure types and iconography of the symposion scene in the decoration areas. As a result of the evaluations, it was determined that the symposion scenes, whose origins date back to the 3rd millennium BC, were used in a wide range of dates from the end of the 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 2nd century AD on the samples, and that the city of Ephesos made local productions in the Late Hellenistic Period tradition of the 4th century BC. In the typology that can be followed chronologically, its relation with the traditions of the cities of Ionia, Lydia and Mysia Region in late periods has been determined. In addition to the iconography, the transverse rectangular stele type that proves local production, the use of figures that cover a large part of the decoration area, and the frequent repetition of the female types popular in the 4th century BC, Ephesos provides important information about the Ionian region grave stele tradition, which is known to be lacking in the current literature

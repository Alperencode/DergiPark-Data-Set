Makale Başlığı: Relationship of thiol/disulphide homeostasis with oxidative stress parameters in non-diabetic, prediabetic and type 2 diabetic Turkish women
Özet: Background and Aims: Deterioration of thiol/disulphide homeostasis (TDH) is found in several diseases, including diabetes. This study aimed to examine the association between TDH and oxidative stress parameters in nondiabetics, prediabetics and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics.Methods: A total of 26 non-diabetic, 24 prediabetic and 19 type 2 diabetic women were involved in our study. They all applied to Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit University, Health Practice and Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Diseases, Diabe- tes Polyclinic to be tested for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The demographic and laboratory data were collected from the patient files. Oxidative stress parameters and dynamic TDH were investigated using ELISA kits.Results: Total oxidant status (TOS), total thiol and disulphide levels were significantly higher in type 2 diabetics than the non-diabetics (24.24±14.93 versus 14.14±12.19, 646.47±75.51 versus 470.88±180.85, and 179.32±51.24 versus 91.85±40.29, respectively). In type 2 diabetics, a positive correlation between TOS and native thiol, total thiol and disulphide levels was found (P=0.000). In prediabetics, a significant positive correlation was found between total antioxidant capacity and total thiol levels (P<0.05), and also between arylesterase and native and total thiol levels (P<0.05).Conclusion: The elevation of oxidative stress and the deterioration of TDH might cause the formation of symptoms related to high blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetics.

Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF POWER OF THE PURSE IN TURKEY IN TERMS OF PRINCIPLE OF ACCURACY
Özet: The essence of the parliamentary system is based on the power of the purse. In other words, parliaments have been formed in order to enable the people to use their power of the purse in representative democracy. However, today it is discussed how effectively the parliaments can use their power of the purse. One of the ways to understand the effectiveness of the parliament in exercising its power of the purse is to evaluate the accuracy of the central government budget revenue and expenditure estimates. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the central government budget revenue and expenditure estimates for the period 1996-2020 in Turkey via the accuracy principle. In the study, the accuracy of the estimations is examined via the "Calculation of Estimation Error" method. As a result, it has been observed that there are no persistent estimation errors at a level that will render the power of the purse ineffective. However, serious estimation errors were encountered in some years in terms of revenue and expenditure. In addition, it has been observed that there are more significant deviations in expenditure estimates between 1996 and 2020 compared to revenue estimates.

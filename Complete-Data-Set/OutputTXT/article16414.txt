Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE USE OF BUILDING MATERIALS PRODUCED BY NANOTECHNOLOGICAL METHOD IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
Özet: Advances in technology and science have led to changes in architectural designs. In addition, the change in user requests and the increase in comfort level over time have had an impact on the change in architectural designs. Nanotechnology, which is among the developing technologies, has contributed to the change and development of architectural designs. In this study, it is aimed to examine the use of building materials produced by nanotechnological method in the construction industry. A literature search was conducted within the scope of the study. In the study, examples of the use of non-technological building materials are given and explained. As a result of the literature review, the use of nanotechnological building materials in the construction industry has enabled durable, high insulation and different architectural designs to be made. In addition, the high optical, thermal and insulating properties of nanotechnological materials have contributed to the protection of nature and the environment in the context of sustainability by ensuring the use of waste products during the production of these materials, as well as increasing the isolation of the structure.

Makale Başlığı: On the Suffix /–(y)AnçA(y/ğ)i/ in Artvin and Ahıska Dialects
Özet: Although the Artvin-Ahıska dialects is considered within the Eastern group of Anatolian dialects, it differs from these dialects with its non-Oghuz language elements. The morpheme /-(y)Ança(y/ğ)i/also constitutes one of the elements mentioned. In our study, firstly, the spread of the morpheme in historical and contemporary Turkish dialects is discussed, and then its structure and functions are emphasized. The same or similar morphemes are used in Kipchak, Khwarezm, Chagatai, Kazan Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Kumuk, Nogay, Kazak, Karakalpak, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Turkmen and New Uyghur Turkish. Except for Artvin-Ahiska dialects, it could not be determined in standard Turkey Turkish and Turkey Turkish dialects, Iraqi, Syrian, Gagauz and Azerbaijan Turkish texts. However, in a small number of examples, it has been seen that Georgia-Borchali Terekeme-Karapapah Turkish and South Azerbaijan Turkish dialects have a parallel form and usage with Artvin-Ahiska dialects. It would be correct to explain its existence in Turkmen Turkish with the influence of Chagatai Turkish and to claim that this morpheme is not a common element in Oghuz group dialects. Therefore, it seems possible to explain the use of the morpheme/–(y)Ança(y/ğ)i/ in the Artvin, Ahıska, Borchali Terekeme-Karapapak and South Azerbaijan dialects only with the non-Oghuz Turkish settlements in the region.

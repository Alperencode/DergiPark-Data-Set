Makale Başlığı: Opinions On The Implementation Process of Elective Drama Course in Secondary Schools
Özet: In this study, the benefits of the drama course for secondary school students and the problems encountered in the application process of the course were examined. The research was designed as a case study. The study group included 20 teachers teaching drama in secondary schools, 23 students taking the course in 5th and 6th grades, their parents; 7 administrators, and 12 drama experts from the schools that implement the course. A drama lesson opinion form was sent by e-mail to the participants in the study group. Obtained opinions were analyzed by content analysis. According to all participants, drama course improves students’ cognitive, affective and social skills, and life skills. This course supports teachers’ communication skills and professional development. Despite all these benefits, the course has problems such as expert teachers, workshops, budget, regulations, teaching tools, and teacher guidebooks. For the drama course to be more productive at schools, it is necessary to train teachers on drama, create drama workshops at schools, make legal arrangements for drama courses, allocate a budget to the course, increase the quality of the curriculum, prepare guidebooks for teachers, and establish a drama informatics network

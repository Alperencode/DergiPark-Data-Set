Makale Başlığı: US Public Diplomacy and Security Cases in Afghanistan
Özet: In this study, the relations and contributions of the concept of public diplomacy as a soft power tool in foreign policy with security policies and practices were examined through the US practices in Afghanistan. Research has been conducted on the fields of public diplomacy in securitization practices as a security approach, the importance of sociocultural intelligence as a data source in public diplomacy practices in humanitarian interventions, and its interaction with counter-terrorism practices. The examined approaches and practices are exemplified through the US intervention in Afghanistan. As a result of these studies, it has been concluded that public diplomacy, a concept which was used as a soft power tool by the states, can effectively be used for studies supporting security applications with the implementation of smart power format and can be nourished through these concepts as it was nourished from the applications stated on the security topic. It has been concluded that the USA's withdrawal from Afghanistan is due to the fact that the production of hard power is much higher than the production of soft power.

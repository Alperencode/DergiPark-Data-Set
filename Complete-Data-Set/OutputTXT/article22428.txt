Makale Başlığı: The Critic of Everyday Life in the Context of Art and Street Art
Özet: As in sociology, “critic of everyday life” has always been one of the important issues in the feld of art. So, it is possible to observe that daily life has been the subject of art in diferent ways throughout the history of art. At frst, this study provides an overview of how everyday life is refected in diferent periods of art history. The aim of the study is to focus on the concept of “criticism of everyday life”, which has become more visible with modernism in art. In addition, throughout the research, the “city”, which emerged as one of the places where art is both produced and consumed in the process of modernism has been deemed worthy to be emphasized as the most important place where daily life and criticism are experienced. When processes such as the Dada Movement, the freedom environment of the 70s, and the neoliberal changes after the 80s are examined, “street art”, which emerged as a movement about and from the city, is now the most criticized place for the artist and the audience who spend most of their daily life in the city has been observed. “Street art” has been considered as one of the forms of struggle put forward by Michel de Certeau, one of the most famous thinkers of the 20th century, as “everyday life practices” and “tactics” developed by city residents against authority. From this basic perspective, qualitative research was used as a method in the study, and in line with the data obtained, the struggles of various street artists were examined. Results show that art and capital both clash with each other by constantly developing "anti-tactics" and allow new creative processes to develop out of this confict.

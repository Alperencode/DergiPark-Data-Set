Makale Başlığı: MAX WEBER: BUREAUCRACY THEORY AND ACCOUNTING APPROACH
Özet: Among Weber's many theories, especially the theory of bureaucracy, although it is often used on the basis of management discipline, is still reflected in many different disciplines today. In this theory, where concepts such as division of labour, hierarchy, specialization and objective evaluation are emphasized, certain notions and their relations that seem to develop in complex bureaucratic structures are discussed. The discipline of accounting is also among the disciplines that have common peculiarities with the theory of bureaucracy. In the sense of a scientific discipline, in addition to the fact that some principles such as money measurement and reliability, which are among the basic principles of accounting and can be explained by the aforementioned theory, there are phenomena that can be explained by bureaucracy theory such as the importance of certification and retention of documents in accounting as a profession. While rationalism is a concept that emphasizes objectivity and logic, a closeness can be established between these two concepts because the outputs are put forward as numbers calculated in an unbiased way in accounting. Financial statements, footnotes and all reports are issued within the framework of certain accounting standards. This is in line with the fact that the rational bureaucracy emphasized in the theory of bureaucracy gains its legitimacy through written rules. The fact that these and similar sociological theories are still valid today proves that it is possible to evaluate theories from different angles with studies on various times, fields, perspectives and disciplines and to reach rich results in this way.

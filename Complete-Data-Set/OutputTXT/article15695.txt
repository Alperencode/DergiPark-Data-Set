Makale Başlığı: The Effect of the Project "Reflections from Daily Life to the Chemistry Classroom" on Pre-service Teachers' Teaching Image and Teaching Styles
Özet: This research aims to examine the effects of online activities, which include reflections from daily life in different teaching methods and techniques, on the teaching images and teaching styles of pre-service chemistry teachers. The activities include methods such as context-based learning, argumentation, project-based learning, problem-based learning, guess-eye-explain, STEM, out-of-school learning, inquiry-based learning, mobile learning and nature of science teaching methods and techniques, which include reflections from daily life. In the 2021-2022 academic year, 34 pre-service chemistry teachers studying in the third and fourth years of chemistry teaching from seven different state university education faculties participated in the research. In this study, a pretest-posttest experimental research design without a control group, one of the quantitative research methods, was used to examine the changes in the teaching images and teaching styles of pre-service chemistry teachers towards themselves. The data were collected with the checklist created for analysis of the drawings, and the pre-service chemistry teachers participating in the research were asked to think of themselves as a teacher in the future and to draw these thoughts. For the analysis of the data obtained, the related samples t-Test from parametric tests was used. As a result of the research, it was determined that online activities, which include reflections from daily life, among the teaching methods and techniques that pre-service chemistry teachers will apply in the education-teaching process, have a statistically significant effect on their teaching images and teaching styles. While pre-service chemistry teachers had both student and teacher-centered teaching images at the beginning of the research, it was concluded that they had student-centered images at the end of the research. In addition, at the beginning of the research, pre-service chemistry teachers generally had a conceptual teaching style, but at the end of the research, it was concluded that they had exploratory teaching styles.

Makale Başlığı: DETERMINING CONSUMERS' PREFERENCES FOR FISH CONSUMPTION: A STUDY IN ANTALYA PROVINCE OF TURKEY
Özet: It is clear that consumption of fishery products, which are important sources of food for meeting the nutritional needs of a rapidly growing population, is directly related to the development criteria of countries, such as awareness of proper nutrition and healthy living. However, Turkey as a developing country is still not benefiting sufficiently from aquatic products as human food despite being rich in water resources. In this context, this study was planned to determine socio-economic structures and fish consumption characteristics and habits of families living in city center of Antalya, one of the important cities of Turkey in terms of education, tourism, agriculture and fisheries. The study was performed during the years 2011-2012 and consisted of survey-derived data obtained from a total of 208 families living in 165 neighborhood residents in Konyaalti, Muratpasa and Kepez districts. The respondents were determined by a proportional stratified random sampling method. According to the survey results monthly fish consumption of the families was around 4.8 kg over the study period and 1.4 kg per capita. It was determined that first preference of the families was anchovy, followed by rainbow trout, farmed gilthead sea bream and Eurpean sea bass, mackerel and red sea bream in descending order. It was also determined that amount of fish consumption was directly proportional to family income status and education level. The most important impetus to consume fish was an opinion of fish being a healthy and delicious food with a high nutritional value.

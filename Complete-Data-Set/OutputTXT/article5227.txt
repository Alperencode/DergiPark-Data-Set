Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Research on the Use of Robotics in Education: A Content Analysis Study
Özet: As programming skills can be used in different fields such as security, education, health, communication, production and finance, research on coding and programming skills in education processes at young ages has become important. In this study, robotic applications in education were chosen as a research topic. Within the scope of the study, after giving information about the use, emergence, history and current status of robotics in education, 204 articles published in Dergipark, ERIC and ScienceDirect databases between 2015 and 2020 were examined. The articles were analyzed in depth under different headings such as sample levels, sample sizes, research areas, and preferred research methods. As a result of the analyzes made, it was concluded that the research focused mostly on primary and secondary school levels, and the sample size of 11-30 participants was preferred more. It has been observed that more qualitative research methods are used more as a method in the studies. It has been determined that the attitude and opinion variables are frequently examined in the studies. As a result of the study, it is recommended to increase the research to be done at pre-school and high school levels and to conduct studies on language learning in research

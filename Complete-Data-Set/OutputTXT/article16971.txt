Makale Başlığı: Aphorisms In The History Of Turkish Veterinary Medicine
Özet: Aphorism (özdeyiş, özlü söz, vecize, ülger, kelamıkibar, aforizm, motto) is defined as a word that tells a thought in the shortest and most precise way and whose utterance is clear. Regarding the veterinary profession, the great statesman İsmet İnönü’s aphorism “It can be said that human medicine is like an inland sea against the ocean next to veterinary medicine” and the National Poet Veterinarian Mehmet Akif Ersoy’s aphorism “It makes sense to you if you experience it, we need a veterinarian more than a human doctor.” These aphorisms are at the forefront of the aphorisms that have been passed down from generation to generation and are known by every member of this profession. During the study of works related to the post-Republican period in Turkey; It has been determined that it is a vocabulary worthy of research in terms of beauty of expression, power of expression, and conceptual richness. In this study, it is aimed to bring these meaningful words of veterinary medicine elders and statesmen to veterinarians by extracting them from the dusty pages of history. While selecting the aphorisms, attention was paid to ensure that they were suitable for the aphorism structure in terms of technical grammar. 37 aphorisms that express from the owner, are short and express judgment have been recorded. It is thought that these meaningful words, which are presented neatly in the study, are important in terms of showing our colleagues a bright way. It can be argued that aphorisms can be useful by being evaluated in student classes, vocational anniversaries, academic opening and graduation ceremonies, etc.

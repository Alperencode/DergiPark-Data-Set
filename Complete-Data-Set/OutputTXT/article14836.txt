Özet: In which cases the execution of the general assembly resolution can be postponed, TCC art. It was edited in 449. In our study, the decision to increase the capital, which is also a decision of the general assembly, will be examined in the context of art.449 of the TCC and art.389 of the HMK. Thus, it will be clarified whether the decision to postpone the capital increase decision fulfills the precautionary measures. In this review, firstly, the legal nature and definition of capital increase has been made. Then, it was stated under which conditions the capital increase decision would be subject to cancellation or nullity sanction. Afterwards, it is explained under which conditions and procedure this decision can be requested from the court. The main debate forming the main body of the study is whether this request is a separate temporary legal protection or a special kind of precautionary measure. The outcome of this discussion will show us whether the postponement of the capital increase decision can be requested before the annulment or nullity lawsuit is filed. Although the decision to postpone the capital increase decision is similar to the precautionary measure issued in the HMK, we have tried to reveal the differences with the HMK.

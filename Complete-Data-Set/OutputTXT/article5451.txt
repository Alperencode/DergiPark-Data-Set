Makale Başlığı: Bibliometric Analysis of Studies on Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) in the Web of Science Database
Özet: Background: Mean platelet volume (MPV) was investigated by many medical disciplines for different disease groups. But, the use of MPV values in clinical practice is limited. In this study, it is aimed to make a bibliometric analysis of studies on MPV over the Web of Science database and also to reveal Turkey's contribution to this issue. Materials and methods: This bibliometric analysis was performed in June 2021 as a result of a search for mean platelet volume (MPV) in all indexes in the Web of Science (WOS) database. Results: The most of the MPV studies in the world were conducted on hematology (1256, 18.9%), general internal medicine (746, 11.2%), peripheral vascular diseases (579, 8.7%), cardiology/cardiovascular system diseases (537, 8%), experimental medicine research departments (376, 5.6%), and surgical sciences (342, 5.1%) in the fields of science/subject. The rank of emergency medicine is 64 (0.9%) in the world and 41 (2.1%) in Turkey. 17 of the 25 authors who published the most were Turkish. Conclusion: In many studies, when the standard deviations are taken into account, the difference between the groups cannot be seen mathematically, even if they are statistically different. Therefore, the use of MPV

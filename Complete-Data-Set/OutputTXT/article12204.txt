Makale Başlığı: CREATING GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) DATABASE WITH UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAV) IN ARCHAELOGICAL AREAS; THE CASE OF ANEMURIUM ANCIENT CITY
Özet: The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which have developed rapidly in recent years, in archaeological sites provides a basis for many studies. It is important to produce the permanent records of archaeological sites for the management cultural heritage. While many methods are used to produce permanent records and boundaries, photogrammetry and remote sensing techniques have begun to be preferred within the process by considering their advantages such as low cost, saving time, and completing studies on cultural heritage without contact. In this study, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Orthomosaic were produced using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in Anemurium Ancient City located in Mersin province. These data were used as a basis, and a relational database was created for GIS. Thus, an inventory study of all stone buildings and roads in the area was conducted, and the data sets were created according to the quality of the remains. Furthermore, the stone buildings in the ancient city were named on an address basis, and a relational database including the boundaries of the country, province, district, and ancient city area was created. This study serves as a guide for studies to be conducted on the management of archaeological sites.

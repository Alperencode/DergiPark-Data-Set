Makale Başlığı: Potential effects of punicalagin on New Zealand White rabbits exposed to  bisphenol A
Özet: The possible effects of punicalagin on some oxidant-antioxidant enzymes and biochemical parameters in bisphenol A (BPA)-treated rabbits were investigated. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups, each containing 6 rabbits: Control (C; corn oil and distilled water), BPA (BPA; 20 mg/kg BPA in corn oil and distilled water), the punicalagin (PUN; corn oil and 2 mg/kg punicalagin in distilled water), and BPA-punicalagin (B+P; 20 mg/kg BPA in corn oil and 2 mg/kg PUN in distilled water) groups. Daily treatments continued for 9 weeks and doses were adjusted according to body weights measured for each week. At the end of the study, hematological, biochemical, and oxidant-antioxidant parameters were measured from blood and tissue samples. The difference in the levels of plasma bilirubin, albumin, total plasma protein, Mg, P, Ca, Na, K, and levels of glutathione peroxidase in plasma, liver, and kidney were non-significant (p>0.1). However, oral BPA administration adversely affected serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, amylase, lipase, CRP, and GGT concentrations. Likewise, malondialdehyde, catalase, and superoxide dismutase levels in the kidney and liver were also negatively altered by BPA (p<0.05). Significant improvements in these parameters were apparent in the B+P group. The data generated here showed that punicalagin possessed a beneficial impact on potentially reducing the possible toxic effects of BPA in rabbits.

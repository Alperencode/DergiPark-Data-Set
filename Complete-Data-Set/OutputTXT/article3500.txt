Makale Başlığı: Modified-release methylphenidate-induced Raynaud’s phenomenon in an adolescent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Özet: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commencing before the age of 12 years and characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity symptoms. Stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) are used as first-line therapy for children with ADHD. Psychostimulants may be associated with vascular problems. Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) is a peripheral vasculopathy potentially associated with connective tissue diseases characterized by recurring reversible vasospasm attacks triggered by cold and emotional stress. Several cases have been published involving RP observed with MPH. The present report discusses a 14-year-old girl with ADHD who experienced RP with the addition of 10 mg modified-release MPH during 27 mg osmotic release (OROS)-MPH therapy, but not during 36 mg OROS-MPH therapy.

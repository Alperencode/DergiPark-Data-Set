Makale Başlığı: BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF GRADUATE THESIS ON E-COMMERCE IN TURKEY
Özet: The lack of bibliometric studies on the theses prepared in the field of e-commerce in the Turkish literature makes the study unique. The importance of e-commerce in the world by companies and academicians necessitates the creation of an e-commerce bibliometric profile. In the study, it is aimed to determine the deficient or superior aspects of the field in question. In this way, it is thought that the study will contribute to closing the gap in the literature. This study covers the postgraduate theses prepared between 2000-2021 and published in the National Thesis Center. In postgraduate theses, men work more on e-commerce than women. Master's theses on the subject are often prepared by academics with the title of Assistant Professor. Master's thesis focuses on e-marketing and e-commerce, total quality management, consumer behaviour and marketing communication. In doctoral studies, e-marketing and e-commerce issues come to the fore the most. There are more theses prepared in the field of e-commerce in state universities. The most thesis on the subject was prepared in Marmara University, and the least in Çankaya University. E-commerce was the most used keyword in the theses that were the subject of the study.

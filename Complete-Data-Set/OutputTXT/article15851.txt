Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF ANTI-VACCINTION IN ACADEMICS
Özet: Purpose: It was planned as a descriptive study in order to determine what academics from certain socio-cultural groups of the society think about vaccines.Method: The population of the research consists of academic staff working at Sivas Cumhuriyet University. In the study, between April 2021 and May 2021, by applying the online form, 104 volunteers who volunteered to participate in the research were reached, without using the sample selection method. After obtaining the necessary ethical and official permissions, data were collected using the socio-demographic characteristics form and the anti-vaccine scale.Results: The mean of total anti-vaccination among academicians was 1.99±0.80. Although it was determined in this study among academics that the mean anti-vaccine score was low and the academics were not anti-vaccine, the opinion that the vaccine has no effect on the Covid-19 process and will not end the pandemic is significantly high.Conclusion: Although there are many factors that can cause the idea of ​​​​vaccination rejection, it has been seen in many studies that the training and counseling provided are quite effective. Therefore, it is very important to raise awareness of the academicians, who are highly educated and open to education, about vaccination.

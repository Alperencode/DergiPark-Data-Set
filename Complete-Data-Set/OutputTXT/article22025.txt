Makale Başlığı: Eacher’s Opinions On The Teaching Professional Law
Özet: There are different laws regulating the legal rights of teachers. Generally, personal rights are regulated by the Civil Servants Law. In addition, there are provisions related to the teaching profession in the Basic Law of National Education and other laws. A regulation regulating the career steps of teachers was issued, but this regulation did not meet the expectations. It is considered essential that the teaching profession law, which concerns a large professional group in the public sector, be enacted as soon as possible. The aim of this study is to reveal the opinions of teachers regarding the draft law that is planned to be enacted. The research is a qualitative study. The study group of the research consists of teachers working in different schools in Ordu province. In the study, the data were tried to be analyzed by using descriptive and content analysis methods. According to the research findings, criticisms about the content of the law and career steps are listed. Major deficiencies regarding career steps and education faculty graduates were mentioned in the law. They expressed some positive aspects of the law regarding solving some problems, increasing the prestige of the profession, providing a financial increase, removing the contractual discrimination and some of the candidate teachers. They offered some suggestions in this regard.

Makale Başlığı: Preliminary Study on the Effects of Some Organic Fertilizers on Raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) Variety Heritage
Özet: Soil structure, chemistry, and fauna are very important in terms of sustainable agricultural production, and it is inevitable to plan productionbased on these factors. In this context, the use of alternative ecosystem-friendly practices should be expanded in agricultural production instead of chemical fertilizers, which have harmful effects if used excessively. In this study, the effects of different fertilization (chemical, organic, and vermicompost) on the physicochemical properties of the "Heritage" cultivar of raspberry, which is loved for its aroma and biochemical content, were investigated. Based on our results, chemical fertilization came to the fore in terms of fruit width (15.83 mm) and length (16.42 mm), while the highest values in terms of fruit weight (1.80 g) were obtained as a result of organic fertilization. In addition to citric acid (20749 mg L-1), which has been identified as the dominant acid of the "Heritage" cultivar, chemical fertilization gave the best results in terms of tartaric acid (2615.54 mg L-1), malic acid (477.71 mg L-1) and titratable acidity (2.47 %) contents. For acetic acid (643.11 mg L-1), ascorbic acid (201.08 mg L-1) and oxalic acid (30.02 mg L-1) contents high results were obtained from vermicompost application. At the same time, the highest total flavonoid content (11.78 mg quercetin L-1) was determined in vermicompost application. The highest values in terms of total anthocyanin (1.54 µg cyan-3-glk g-1) and total phenol (590.11 mg GAE L-1) content were measured from chemical fertilizer application. Organic fertilization came to the fore in terms of antioxidant activity (95.24%), which is affected by many of the aforementioned metabolites. As a result of the study, it was determined that the application most affecting yield was organic fertilizer.

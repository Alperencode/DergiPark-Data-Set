Makale Başlığı: EXAMPLE PRODUCTIONS ON COMPLEMENTATION APPLICATIONS IN RESTORATION IN THE CONTEXT OF ANATOLIAN TURKISH TILE ART
Özet: Terracotta products, which have developed in parallel with the existence of human beings, have become unique with their raw materials, production technologies, application techniques and usage patterns, and they have become the property of the civilizations to which they are connected. In this context, the most important products of terracotta practices in Anatolian Turkish art are tiles. In Anatolian Turkish art, tiles were used on the surfaces of architectural works and as functional daily use items. Similar to the difference in the usage areas of tiles, different techniques are seen in their production.In the study, the historical development of Anatolian Turkish tile art is briefly mentioned. Information is given about the production stage of the seven selected traditional tile techniques, their usage areas and the type of part-unit material losses that develop over time in the tiles. Then, fifteen different completion applications were made for these distortions on twenty-nine tile panels produced in seven different traditional techniques in the workshop environment. With these applied completion examples, it is aimed to show that it is possible to protect the original structural and decorative features of the tiles by reaching a certain amount of visual integrity. In this way, the misleading and damaging effects of mimetic completions and unsubstantiated pattern completions already detected in historical tile repairs on the perception of original tiles were examined and inferences were made in the context of restoration principles.

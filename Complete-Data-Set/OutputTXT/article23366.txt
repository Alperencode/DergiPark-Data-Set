Makale Başlığı: Turkish Perception of the Anzacs in the Dardanelles Campaign
Özet: The great offensive of the Allied forces against Gallipoli during World War 1 has been studied extensively in Turkey because of its impact on the outcome of the Great War and its high record of human losses. The internationalization of the anniversary of the Gallipoli Campaigns with the participation of people and academics from participating countries, New Zealand and Australia in particular, may also have played a part in this rising public awareness. New journals and special issues dedicated to Dardanelles studies have helped to unearth important details and previously untold stories of the participants. Nevertheless, in Turkey, the participation, contribution, and impact of the Anzacs on the Dardanelles Campaign have not received the interest they deserve. Even a cursory look at the articles and books dedicated to the Dardanelles Campaign reveals a lack of interest in the Anzacs’ participation during the battles—a participation which even led to the naming of the cove in the Gallipoli peninsula after the Anzacs for the high losses they sustained. Worse perhaps is that the immense literature in English about the Anzacs and the Dardanelles Campaign has been overlooked in Turkish literature. In this presentation, I will therefore present what we know in Turkey about the Anzacs and suggest some ways to increase public awareness about them.

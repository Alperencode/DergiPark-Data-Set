Makale Başlığı: Acro-osteolysis and calcinosis in patient with scleroderma: a case report
Özet: Acro-osteolysis is a rare disease characterized by bone resorption involving the distal phalanges of the hand. We experienced a unique case that acro-osteolysis progressed rapidly to whole aspect of distal phalanges and calcifications were also scattered in several joints due to limited scleroderma in only two years. The calcified deposit of one proximal interphalangeal joint was excised under local anesthesia. Drug therapy was also performed under the care of rheumatologist. There is no fundamental treatment for scleroderma-involved hands; therefore, it is recommended that optimal treatment be pursued in cooperation with rheumatologists and hand surgeons. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0388This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

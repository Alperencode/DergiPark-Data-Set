Makale Başlığı: IN-WORK POVERTY: SITUATION ANALYSIS IN THE EU AND TURKEY
Özet: In-work poverty refers to the lack of sufficient income to meet the needs of the person and their families even though they are working. In this study, it aims to reveal the causes and effects of in-work poverty and profile of the working poor in the light of data from the EU and Turkey. In this direction, the prominent causes and effects were determined and discussed through a literature review, and the data on the working poor were examined descriptively. As a result of the examination, it has been seen that working for temporary and low wages, household structure and density, and individual factors such as education, gender, age, health, and migration status are determinants of in-work poverty. On the other hand, it has been determined that the risk of working poverty is higher for men as a gender, for those with primary education or below as an education level, for single-parent families as a household structure, for part-time workers for working hours, and for those working in a temporary job as a contract type. The results reveal that employment alone does not protect the individual from poverty and that it is important to create good jobs together with employment.

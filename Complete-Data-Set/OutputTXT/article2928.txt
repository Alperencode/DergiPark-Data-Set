Makale Başlığı: USE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR THE CRIME OF FINANCING OF TERRORISM
Özet: Although cryptocurrency systems are useful because of their technological innovations as well as their facilitating features for large-scale money transfers, they create an attractive area for criminals because they provide a confidential area to their users by hiding their user's identity information. The fact that the blockchain technology used in the production, transfer and protection of cryptocurrencies is independent of any authority causes it to be away from the surveillance and control of states or institutions. This feature of the system pushes criminals to this area, which is difficult to trace, and cryptocurrencies can be used to commit many crimes such as theft, fraud, looting, drug and stimulant drug trade, arms trade, money laundering and terrorist financing. In this study, first of all, it will be explained the elements of the crime of financing of terrorism, which is regulated in the Turkish legislation. And then the answer to the question of "what is cryptocurrency" will be sought in order to determine whether cryptocurrencies will constitute the subject of the crime of financing of terrorism. In the light of these, if cryptocurrencies are accepted as a funds, their use in committing the crime of financing terrorism will be evaluated.

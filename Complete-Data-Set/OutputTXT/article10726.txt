Makale Başlığı: MODELING OF ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC SERVO SYSTEM USING THE BEES ALGORITHM
Özet: In this study, a method is proposed to find the unknown simulation parameters of an industrial electro-hydraulic proportional valve. Electro-hydraulic servo systems are one of the most widely used actuator systems, and proportional valves are commonly found in hydraulic systems. Hydraulic systems are complicated to linearize, because nearly whole elements are nonlinear, with the inclusion of the valve actuators. The system model must be linearized to make it feasible for analysis of the system linearly or the characteristics must be identified by comparison the output responses suitable for the inputs. However, it is not easy to obtain a perfect system model for use in simulation studies without prior knowledge of the system. Obtaining a perfect model of a system that is not easy to model can be done in two different ways; applying one of the system identification methods after collecting experimental data or using manufacturers' datasheets. In this paper, simulation parameters of MOOG brand D675 series proportional servo valve system were obtained using The Bees Algorithm, an optimization algorithm, to match the dynamic specifications in the datasheet provided by the manufacturer. The obtained system model and the answers are shown graphically and the effectiveness of the proposed method is discussed.

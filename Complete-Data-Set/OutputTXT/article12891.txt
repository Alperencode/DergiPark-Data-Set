Makale Başlığı: UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH THE METHOD OF HISTORICAL RELATIVITY: THE GERMAN HISTORICAL SCHOOL
Özet: The purpose of this study is to examine the economic perspective they reached by using the method they used in grounding the economic views of the German Historical School (ATO), which has a very different understanding from its contemporaries in the field of economics. The historical tradition sees cultural institutions as the foundation of economic development. The School, which is among the heterodox schools of economics, sheds light on the connection between the changing social structure and economic development processes with its historical studies. It emphasizes the subjective situations that can change from country to country and the different economic progress patterns that these will lead to, instead of the assumptions such as “logical universal knowledge” and “metatheory” in the orthodox economics approach. The importance of the method and discourse of the school is sought in the historical conditions and in the economic development process of Germany that took place at that time. For this reason, in the study, the social, administrative and economic conditions in Germany at the time the School emerged are investigated through the method of historical relativity. The opinions of thinkers and School representatives of the period, especially about the economic development processes and the reasons for this, are transferred from secondary sources. Thus, it is desired to understand the share of the changes in the social values and thought system motivated by the conditions of that period in economic development. The events in the history of Germany and the views of the German Historical School state that each culture feeds on itself and it is possible to understand economic development by following the evolution of these cultural institutions.

Makale Başlığı: Does Vitamin D Status Alter the Severity af Preeclampsia? A Single-Center Case-Control Study
Özet: Aim:  We aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of preeclampsia.Material and Methods: We conducted a case-control study aiming to evaluate vitamin D serum levels in patients with preeclampsia(PE), severe preeclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets). Total number of 69 patients between the ages of 18 and 40 either had a spontaneous vaginal delivery or C-section were included in the study. Results: The demographic data of the patients were similar, and age was higher in severe PE than in the other groups. When body mass index (BMI)  was evaluated,  the average BMI of the patients in the severe PE group was found to be significantly higher than PE and similar to the other groups. The average vitamin D levels of all groups was 8.75±3.5 and the mean of severe PE was 6.69±3, which was significantly lower than the other groups. The average vitamin D level in PE was 10.99±2.91, and it was higher than all groups and was significantly higher than patients with severe PE and HELLP syndrome.Conclusion: We think that there is a significant relationship between the severity of hypertensive disorders that begin during pregnancy and the degree of vitamin D deficiency. We think that the control of vitamin D level and its addition to the treatment will positively affect the course of the disease in order to prevent hypertensive disorders and reduce the severity of disease.

Makale Başlığı: Mathematical Model Developed Using Heat Transfer Coefficient and Clothing Permeability Factor Parameters to Prevent Pressure Ulcer
Özet: Pressure ulcers are wounds that occur in bedridden patients as a result of staying in the same position for a long time, due to external causes such as pressure, friction, shearing and moisture. Pressure ulcer is a serious problem all over the world when evaluated in terms of hospital capacity, nurse employment and treatment costs. Prevention studies gain importance as the cost of pressure ulcer prevention is less than the cost of treatment. In this study, we improved a mathematical model obtained in one of our previous study in order to prevent pressure ulcers or delay wound formation. In addition to the previous model, the new model calculates the effect of  hc   (heat transfer coefficient) and Fpcl (clothing permeability factor) parameters on the risk of pressure ulcer formation through the body area value. The effects of these parameters on the formation of pressure ulcers are shown in graphics. The results obtained from the new model shown that the sensitivity in the determination of the risk of pressure ulcer formation has increased. Thus, early detection of wound formation was provided by calculating the risk of pressure ulcer formation.

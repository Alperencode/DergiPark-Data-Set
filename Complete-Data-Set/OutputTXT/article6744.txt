Makale Başlığı: MEASURING THE LEVEL OF THE TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY OF THE WORLD BANK MEMBER COUNTRIES’ HEALTH SYSTEM: AN APPLICATION ON DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS
Özet: There are many discussions on the content and the scope of the concept of performance but it’s frequently used in management literature and it can be basically defined as the degree of achieving the objectives intended.  Thus, performance measurement is one of the most crucial issues for the health sector as much as it does for others. Also, it is necessary to improve the health systems of countries that cannot use their resources effectively. This study was carried out in order to compare the health systems of the World Bank member countries and to offer some solutions for increasing the performance of the countries which in the same/similar income group and are ineffective. Data Envelopment Analysis, input-oriented and variable to the scale, was used to achieve the objectives of the study. This method was first put forward in 1978 and developed as a result of the following studies. In this study, countries firstly divided into different groups according to their income levels and then compared with the other countries within their own groups. As a result of the study, it has been determined that most of the high-income countries have a more effective health system. It was also found that a significant part of the resources of the middle-low and low countries were idle. It is thought that the countries that are found to be ineffective should plan by considering the country's objectives. In this context, it’s thought this study will provide evidence-based information for managers and decision-makers.

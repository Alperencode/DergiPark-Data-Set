Makale Başlığı: Al-Marifa in Mawlana: The Tendency towards the Phenomenological and Epistemological Aspects of What Exists
Özet: With the distinctions he made regarding the use of the concept of al-marifa, Mawlana is deemed to have pointed out that it is necessary to use al-marife in its true position rather than in its wrong place.The tendency of knowing leads man as a knowing one to know what exists as a whole. The function of al-marifa in this context seems worthy of attention.In addition to this, in today's digital age, al-marifa can become more important. With special reference to this inference, the phenomenological and epistemologial aspects of what exists that force the human mind can be rethought as a problem of knowledge through al-marifa.

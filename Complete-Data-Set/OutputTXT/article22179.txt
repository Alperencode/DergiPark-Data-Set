Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of Covid-19 Vaccination Decision in the Framework of the Health Belief Model
Özet: In order to achieve community immunity against the COVID-19 epidemic, the majority of the society should adopt the vaccine and accept to be vaccinated, together with the vaccine development studies. Our study focuses on the ambivalence and rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine, which has the potential to pose a significant threat in the fight against the epidemic. In the study, it was aimed to explain the decisions of individuals regarding the COVID-19 vaccine within the framework of the health belief model and to reveal the differences between the groups who accept and reject the COVID-19 vaccine and who are undecided about the vaccine with the multinomial logistic regression analysis. A quantitative research technique based on the questionnaire data was used to find answers to the research questions. Our study findings show that the domestic COVID-19 vaccine is rejected by only 16%, implying that the domestic vaccine may be preferred more than foreign vaccines. Strategies to raise awareness of vaccine benefits and reduce perceived risks for high vaccination acceptance should target women, lower socioeconomic groups, and particularly individuals with chronic illness.

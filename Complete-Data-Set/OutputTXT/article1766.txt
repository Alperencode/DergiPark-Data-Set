Makale Başlığı: Tapureli Houses: New Examples from Eastern Rough Cilicia
Özet: The settlement of Tapureli is located on three hills connected to the Kızılgeçit Valley, 32 km north of the Erdemli district in the province of Mersin. It has been partially studied before but in this paper, the dwellings found during the archaeological surveys carried out in the area by Ümit Aydınoğlu and his team will be considered. Tapureli is characterized by an uninterrupted residential architecture dating back to Hellenistic, Roman and Late Antique periods. These houses, which will be the topic of study for the first time, will be compared with examples from Eastern Rough Cilicia and other regions, and their plan will be evaluated in terms of their intended use and architectural techniques.

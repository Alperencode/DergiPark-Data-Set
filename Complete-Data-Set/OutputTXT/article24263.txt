Makale Başlığı: Occult external iliac vein injury after  anterior dislocation of the sacroiliac joint in adult patient
Özet: Anterior dislocation of the sacroiliac joint, characterized by dislocation of the ilium anterior to the sacrum, is a subtype of complete posterior pelvic ring disruption. Only a few reports have described it. It occurs mostly in children. We present an adult case with anterior dislocation of the sacroiliac joint that was caused by severe violence. It was associated with numerous complications. To the best of our knowledge, it is only the second case reported in the literature. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0347This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

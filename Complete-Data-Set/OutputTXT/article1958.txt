Makale Başlığı: Effects of Leadership Types on Job Satisfaction Among Malaysian Higher Education Institutions
Özet: Employee job satisfaction is an important component of any job and could be influenced by different types of leadership. Keeping employees happy and satisfied while at the same time being a great leader is an extremely difficult balance, especially in educational leadership, where there are two different types of employees, mainly administrators, and educators. It requires a leader who can balance between the lines and choose the proper leadership style to motivate different types of employees. This study looks at three different leadership types: laissez-faire, transformational and transactional leadership. A purposeful sampling of 393 participants was  utilized to sample educators from Malaysia's private and governmental education institutions. Data were collected using questionnaires. The findings indicated that transformational leadership and laissez-faire have a significant relationship to job satisfaction where laissez-faire (β = 0.608, t = 16.576, p = 0.000) and transformational leadership (β = 0.865, t = 8.498; p = 0.000), while transactional leadership has an insignificant relationship with job satisfaction (β = -0.019, t = 0.747, p = 0.227).

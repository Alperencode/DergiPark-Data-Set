Makale Başlığı: USING EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CLASSES: A CASE STUDY
Özet: This study describes class teachers’ perceptions, experiences and views about using educational technologies in Science and Technology classes. To this end, a total of 10 teachers, 5 male and 5 females, working at a low socioeconomic level state primary school in Kırşehir, were included in the study. The data collection tool used was a “semi-structured interview form”. The study was conducted with two researchers, one of whom kept interview notes and recorded the interviews with a recorder and video-camera. The other researcher asked the questions to class teachers and tried to keep the interviews within a chat atmosphere but without diverting from the aim. The data thus collected were analyzed with descriptive data analysis. The findings suggested that using educational technologies in Science and Technology classes contributes positively to the teaching-learning process.

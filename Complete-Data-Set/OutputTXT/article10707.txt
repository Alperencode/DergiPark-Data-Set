Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Periodic Examination Time Interval and Frequency After “Percutaneous Coronary Intervention” on Experiencing Second "Acute Coronary Syndrome"
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of follow-ups of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at short (<6 months) and long-term intervals and media on their experiencing attacks of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).Methods: The data of 281 patients who underwent twice PCI in our clinic were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as those who came to the controls regularly at intervals of ≤ 6 months (Group 1, n: 157) and those who came irregularly or at intervals of more than 6 months (Group 2, n: 124). We investigated whether regular periodic controls have any positive effect on adequate statin use, experiencing acute coronary syndrome episodes and cardiac mortality.Results: In Group 2; frequency of ACS [87.8% versus 20.6%, p<0.001], insufficient use of statins [86.4% versus 16.7% p <0.001], and withdrawal of statins by media influence [64.0% versus 5.1% p <0.001] was higher than Group 1.Conclusions: Looking at the results of the study; it can be said that regular follow-up of patients with a cardiac event at 6-month intervals reduces the rate of acute coronary syndrome experience and treatment compliance is better in these people.

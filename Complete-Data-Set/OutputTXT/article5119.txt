Makale Başlığı: Determination of the Nutritional and Anti-Methanogenic Properties of Some Green Plants as Food
Özet: This study aims to determine the nutrients of some green plants and their anti-methanogenic potentials with in vitro gas production techniques. For this purpose, lettuce, purslane, sorrel, parsley, dill, cress, and mint plants were examined. The highest dry matter was found in the dill plant with 21.78% and the lowest in the lettuce plant with 7.24%. The average protein of the plants was found to be 30.58%. The highest net gas production was observed in the sorrel plant with 66.66, the lowest value in the purslane 27.66. In this study, it was determined that the purslane plant showed high anti-methanogenic properties. Broccoli, celery, mint, leek, lettuce, green onion, dill and parsley showed moderate anti-methanogenic properties; Chard, sorrel, cress and spinach showed low anti-methanogenic properties. The anti-methanogenic potentials of plants were determined entirely. However, it must be determined with in vivo experiments.

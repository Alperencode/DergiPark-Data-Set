Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Burnout and Emotional Labor among Social Service Workers: The Case of Adiyaman
Özet: The aim of this is to reveal the relationship between the three sub-dimensions of emotional labor and the three sub-dimensions of burnout. In this context, we have collected data from the employees working in the Family, Labor and Social Services Directorates operating in Adiyaman and its districts through questionnaires. We have analyzed the data obtained from the research by transferring it to the SPSS 25 program. As a result of the study, we have seen that surface acting has a positive and significant relationship with emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. We have also found that deep acting has a positive and significant relationship with depersonalization and personal accomplishment. Finally, we have found that genuine acting has a negative and significant relationship with emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, while it has a positive and significant relationship with personal accomplishment.

Makale Başlığı: Can Skopje, An Ottoman Sanjak, Be Evaluated Officially Fixed Price Fines  Economically?
Özet: Migration is moving from one place to another place. Extraordinary situations such as wars, epidemics or natural disasters end with the displacement of people and thus their migration, which leads to some consequences in terms of both migration sending and receiving sides as well as social and geographical consequences. The 93 War between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian State witnessed a great migration wave. Especially with the loss of Bulgaria after the war, the Muslim people living in Bulgaria became refugee and were settled in Skopje, an important Ottoman sanjak due to its strategic location, by the Ottoman State. The Ottoman Empire used every opportunity for the Bulgarian immigrants to maintain their lives. It implemented price control, which is one of its general economic policies, effectively to that end. As in other regions within the borders of the Ottoman Empire, it continued this control which means narh policy in Skopje, and punished those who acted in the opposite direction. The aim of the study is to evaluate the Skopje during and after the 93 War within the scope of fines of narh.

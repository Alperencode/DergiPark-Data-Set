Özet: It is possible to say that clothes are visual communication tools and give information about societies and past cultures. The main purpose of this study is to analyze Dolce Gabbana's 2014 Spring "Ready to wear-an unconscious dream" collection from a semiotic point of view and to examine the establishment and meaning of the cultural codes of the signs in the designed pieces. The universe of the study; It consists of 79 pieces in Dolce Gabbana's 2014 Spring "Ready to wear-an unconscious dream" collection.The sample, on the other hand, was determined by the purposive sampling method of 5 pieces, among 79 pieces, on which the cultural codes of the Ancient Greek period were included.In the study, Gabbana's 2014 Spring "Ready to wear-an unconscious dream" collection is interpreted semiotically through the interpretation scheme of Roland Barthes and Julia Kristeva's concept of interclothing. As a result, gold coins of the ancient Greek period, on which the city goddess Athena and the nymph Arethusa were featured, were often used in clothing.With the use of the city goddess Athena, it was emphasized that the clothes were designed for city women and private individuals. Simple and comfortable clothes made of Linen and Silk fabrics made direct references to Ancient Greek clothes. All materials and symbols used in clothes, shoes, bags and accessories are an example of a reading of Ancient Greek culture and the concept of interclothing.

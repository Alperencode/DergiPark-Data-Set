Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Cartoon on Students' Academic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis Study
Özet: In this research, it is aimed to determine the total effect of the effect size values of the studies that reveal the effect of the use of cartoons in the lessons on the academic achievement of the students by using experimental methods, and the total effect by combining them with the meta-analysis method. For this purpose, doctorate and master's theses published in the Higher Education Institution (YÖK) National Thesis Center database and open to access were scanned. In this context, 48 theses, which were made between 2005-2021, examining the effect of cartoons on academic achievement, were examined, and 17 experimental studies that were suitable for inclusion criteria in the meta-analysis were included in the analysis. CMA statistics program was used in the analysis of the data. In this study, due to the collection of data from experimental studies, analyzes based on standardized mean difference were performed. Effect sizes were calculated using arithmetic mean, standard deviation and sample sizes, and the results were interpreted according to Cohen'd effect sizes. In addition to examining the funnel scatterplot in the calculation of publication bias, Orwin's Safe N calculation, Duval and Tweedie's Trimming and Filling, Egger's regression test and Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation tests were also examined. As a result of the proof that the effect sizes of the theses included in the study showed a high level of heterogeneous distribution (Q=78.179; I2=79.534; p

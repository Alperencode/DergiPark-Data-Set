Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Rootstock (C. maxima × C. moschata) Use on Leaf Hairiness in Melon
Özet: The number of leaf hairs and hair density can be effective in reducing the effects of different stress factors. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of rootstock usage on leaf hair density in melon plant. For this purpose, Galia type (Çıtırex F1) melon grafted on two commercial pumpkin rootstocks (Kardoso and Nun 9075) and ungrafted Çıtırex melon variety was used as control. According to the results of the study, the highest leaf hair number and hair density were obtained from grafted plants, while the lowest was obtained from non-grafted plants. It was determined that powdery mildew damage on leaves and Tetranychus urticae (Two spotted spider mites) damage were reduced in grafted plants. It is evaluated that the leaf hairiness can be increased by grafting in melon and accordingly some leaf damage can be reduced. Studies seeking to understand the impact of herbivores and pathogens on plant performance should also consider the impact of the environment and rootstock use on leaf hairiness.

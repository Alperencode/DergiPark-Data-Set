Makale Başlığı: Supplier selection with dematel and copras methods: An application in the ready -made clothing sector
Özet: In the ready-made clothing sector which has an important share in the country’s economy, competitiveness levels are getting harder due to the wide variety of products and the rapid change in fashion and customer needs. In order for businesses in the ready-made clothing sector to increase their level of competition, they should closely follow the demands and requirements of their customers. Today, it is impossible for businesses to meet customer needs by themself. Therefore, businesses need suppliers in the production process and they need to choose suppliers by taking many criteria into account. For this reason, it is very important for businesses to choose the best supplier that will meet the needs of their customers and can provide high quality products at low prices and at the desired time. Based on this importance, the aim of the study is to choose the best fabric supplier for a business operating in the ready-made clothing sector in Giresun. As a result of the literature research and interviews with the experts in the business, 13 criteria were determined. An integrated approach, in which DEMATEL and COPRAS methods are used together, has been adopted in order to determine the best supplier for a business operating in the ready-made clothing industry.

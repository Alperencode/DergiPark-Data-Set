Makale Başlığı: Does Brand Placement Practices Predict Brand Recall?
Özet: Brand placement is one of the most preferred strategies that companies use to advertise. Although there are too many studies on brand placement, there are not enough studies on its effects on brand recall. From this point this study aims to investigate a) Is there any relationship between the type of product placement and brand recall?; b) Is there any relationship between the type of association with the brand and brand recall?; c) Is there any relationship between time on screen and brand recall?; d) Are there any differences in brand recall among gender?. To find an answer to these research questions mixed methodology was adapted and both qualitative and quantitative studies are conducted. One of the most brand-included movie “Devil Wears Prada” is chosen for this study. In the first step by using categories, the authors conducted the content analysis. In the second step, the movies were watched by 209 participants, and they filled out a survey. Valid scales are used for designing the survey. The findings indicated that using visual brand placement and the recall rates are showing a parallel output. Although the first remembered brands are having a higher duration in the movie, Prada only appeared for 8 seconds but was remembered by the participants, whereas Motorolla and Lincoln appeared more but were remembered less. So the personal experience with the brand might affect brand recall too. In addition, fashion-related brands are recognized more in the female sample.

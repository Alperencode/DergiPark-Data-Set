Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the predictability of prognoses of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the pandemic service by hospitalization blood values: A retrospective study
Özet: Objectives: Prognostic predictors are important for the rapid response and optimal use of the health system during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It has been reported that many hematological parameters may deteriorate starting from the early stages in COVID-19 patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between hematological and biochemical parameters of patients followed in the service, intensive care hospitalization, and mortality. Methods: The present study is a retrospective study. Participants consist of patients hospitalized in the pandemic service between 1.09.2021 and 15.12.2021. All 366 patients hospitalized in the relevant date range were evaluated, and after exclusion criteria, the study was conducted on 242 patients. Polymerase chain reaction tests of all patients were positive. The hematological and biochemical parameters of the patients on the first day of hospitalization, their age, height, weight, gender, chronic diseases, and steroid treatments were recorded. According to service exits, patients were categorized into three groups: transfer to intensive care (discharged after intensive care treatment), resulting in death (transferred from the ward to intensive care unit and died without discharge), and discharged home (discharged home from the ward without intensive care admission). Results: Of the 242 patients included in the study, 135 (55.8%) were female and 107 (44.2%) were male. Of the patients, 213 (88%) were discharged home from the ward, 8 (3.3%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, and 21 (8.7%) died. The mean age of the patients who died (69.6±13.14 years) was significantly higher than of those transferred to the intensive care unit (61.25±15.75) and discharged home from the service (68.91±12.97). When the patients were divided into two groups as survived and dead; age, lymphocyte, blood urea nitrogen, glomerular filtration rate, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, C reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, platelet lymphocyte ratio (TLO) and neutrophil lymphocyte Ratio (NLO) values were significantly different between the two groups. According to the regression model created with significant values, age, high NLO and D-dimer, and low TLO were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. Conclusion: In the present study, age, D-dimer, TLO and NLO measured on the day of hospitalization were found to be independent prognostic markers for mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Makale Başlığı: Cruise tourism directed to natural and cultural landscape areas in the Black Sea Basin
Özet: Cruise tourism and tourism routes directed to the natural and cultural landscape areas of the region constitute the paradigm of this study, which is considered as an alternative tourism type in the Black Sea basin. With this paradigm developed for international port cities that have coasts on the Black Sea basin, each dynamic of the cultural, social, and economic values of the cities at national and international levels are approached as a phenomenon in this study. In this study, the results obtained by correlating the cognitive states of individuals resulting from the "natural sociability-social experience-social environment" approach in touristic travel with the cruise tourism type in the Black Sea basin are examined with empirical methods. In addition to correlation and regression analysis, landscape planning and design criteria are also used in route planning to reveal the causal relationships between cruise tourism experiences and people's destination loyalty. Both the sustainability of the attraction of natural and cultural landscape areas in destination loyalty and the positive conscience gained from the tourism experiences the people are examined with proactive solution suggestions in this study. In this context, with cruise tourism, which is suggested as an alternative tourism type for cities on the coast of the Black Sea basin, a management model for touristic routes is developed by providing opportunities both for the people to experience different tourism activities and the development of regional tourism.

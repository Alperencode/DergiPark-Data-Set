Makale Başlığı: Comparison of photosynthetic pigment and gas exchange parameters in laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) populations
Özet: Studies on the characterization and evaluation of plant genetic resources should be carried out in order to identify and conserve laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) gene resources from medicinal and aromatic plants of commercial importance in Turkey. This study was carried out with the aim of determining photosynthetic characteristics of containerized laurel seedlings grown from seeds collected from Antalya, Muğla and İzmir regions. Photosynthetic properties (net photosynthetic rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid) were determined in the seedlings of three populations in August and October during the first growing season following sowing. According to the results obtained, in August, İzmir-Bayındır population had the highest net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, while Antalya-Manavgat population had the lowest values. In October, Muğla-Gökova population showed higher stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and carotenoid than others. The differences between the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll contents of the populations were found to be statistically insignificant. Based on the photosynthetic pigment and gas exchange parameters, İzmir-Bayındır and Muğla- Gökova populations were found to be the most promising populations. These populations can be assessed in the future breeding program of laurel.

Makale Başlığı: A PANEL DATA ANALYSIS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANK EFFICIENCY AND INNOVATION
Özet: The recent Covid-19 pandemic as a health crisis has shown that the fragilities of financial system are not the results of financial crises only. In order not to be negatively affected by these fragilities, it has gained importance for the banking system, which has a central position in the financial system, to not only maintain current efficiency levels, but also to detect inefficiencies and increase productivity. Innovation has been coming to the forefront as one of the most important tools that the banking system can use for this purpose because it ensures banking services to be offered more efficiently with new technologies, processes and products. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency levels of the banks and to examine the relationship between bank efficiency and innovation. For this purpose, the efficiency levels of 14 banks operating in Turkey between 2014-2019 were calculated using non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and then whether or not they are explained by the innovation variables in the fixed effects panel regression model was analyzed. It can be said that the research findings are important because they show that research and development-based innovation variables do not provide evidence but bank age and bank size may provide evidence in explaining the efficiency of the banks in the sample, and also because they show that the field is open to empirical research within the framework of theoretical discussions.

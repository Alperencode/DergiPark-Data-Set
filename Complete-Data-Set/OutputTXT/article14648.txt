Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Flight Activity and Damage Status of European Grapevine Moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
Özet: The present study was carried out between 2013 and 2014 in vineyards in Ankara province on the Kalecik karası grape variety. The aim was to determine the biological characteristics of Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) such as adult flight activity, the duration of its presence in nature and the number of generations per year. These characteristics are essential for the control, as well as for the evaluation of the damage status. During this study, the first adults of L. botrana were caught in April and the first peak of the pest was seen in the last week of April in both years. The second peak of the pest occurred in the second-third week of June and it produced two generations per year. It was also determined that the flight of adults ended in September. European grapevine moth adults were found to be active for about six months. Although there were European grapevine moths in the vineyard during the control and count at vegetation and harvest period, there were no eggs and larvae or damage on grapes during harvest of both years. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that it is not necessary to use chemicals to control of L. botrana in the vineyards of Kalecik karası.

Makale Başlığı: Examination of the Effect of Culture on Interior Design in the Scope of the Concept of Glocalization through Lobby Designs of Chain Hotels, Marriott Hotel Example
Özet: Glocalization as a concept; is to adapt global products or values to local cultures. For example, while using generally accepted design elements in the interior designs of chain hotels, which are global businesses, glocalization effects are also observed. This study aims to determine the designs made in the context of glocalization in the lobbies where the chain hotels create the first impressions of the customers. For this purpose, a literature review was conducted. The Marriott Hotel, the world's largest hotel group, has been designated as the experimental site, according to Forbes. According to the world cultural regions map, one hotel from 8 different cultural regions was selected and examined within the scope of visuals and cultural identity elements on official websites. As a result, the elements reflecting the local culture in the lobbies of the selected hotels were determined and the effects of glocalization on interior design were revealed.

Makale Başlığı: Biogenic amines contents of Van herby cheese matured by different methods
Özet: In this study, biogenic amines levels of Van herby cheese (Van Otlu peynir) matured in dry-salted/filling (basin a) and brine (salamura)-salted techniques were investigated. For this purpose, a total of 100 herby cheese samples matured by dry-salted and brine-salted techniques (50 dry-salted and 50 brine-salted) were purchased from the grocery stores in Van province, and chemical characteristics and biogenic amines contents of the samples were determined. The mean chemical composition for Van herby cheese matured by dry-salted method and brine-salted methods were, respectively, as follows: pH value 4.62 and 5.16, acidity 1.50% and 1.08%, salt content 7.85% and 7.15%, dry matter content 59.07% and 49.22%, fat 27.00% and 23.43%, protein content 23.39% and 17.17% and protein hydrolysis of 100.92 mM and 79.57 mM, indicating that dry-salted Van herby cheese had significantly lower pH values and significantly greater acidity and protein, dry matter, and fat content than brine-salted Van herby cheese (P < 0.05). In addition, only the tyramine levels were significantly greater in the dry-salted group than the brine-salted group approximately twice high (P < 0.001). In terms of the other biogenic amines, no significant difference was found between two groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, none of the biogenic amines levels measured in Van herby cheese produced by both techniques were above the levels considered to be dangerous for human health. More detailed research is needed to better elucidate the importance of present findings in terms of human health.

Makale Başlığı: An autonomous hydrogen production system design based on the solid chemical hydride
Özet: This paper develops a hydrogen generator prototype that is for fuel cell systems used in portable applications. This generator is designed based on the use of solid-state hydrides with high hydrogen storage capacity in the catalytic hydrolysis reaction. Some using problems such as unstable hydrogen production, one-off service life, heavy or large-volume storage system, and short duty time can be avoided in moveable applications when the use of the produced prototype. In addition, A simulation model and an autonomous control algorithm, which evaluates the hydrogen generation and temperature responses of the prototype, are developed. The results confirm that the performance of a portable and autonomous prototype with 4 parts and 1-hour hydrogen production capacity is enough for small fuel cell applications.

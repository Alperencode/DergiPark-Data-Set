Makale Başlığı: ROMANTIC GUITAR RESTORATION WORK
Özet: In this article; The stages of the restoration work of a 130-year-old romantic guitar produced in France are described. When we received the instrument in question; The neck and sound box were separated from each other, the keyboard was broken in two, cracks were formed in the upper and lower soundboards, some of the harmonic beams had come off from the adhesion surfaces, and some of the ornaments on the rosettes had fallen off. When this unplayable musical instrument is considered in detail in terms of both its historical background, materials and workmanship, it has been understood that it is a valuable and good musical instrument reflecting its period, and it has been decided to be restored. After the evaluation, first of all, the plan of the study was prepared and all repairs of the instrument were carried out step by step in line with this planning. In the repair work carried out, care was taken to preserve the original structure of the instrument as much as possible. However, necessary structural changes have been made in order for it to be performed today and used easily for many years. All stages of the meticulous work were photographed and documented. Thanks to this restoration, the romantic guitar was made functional again and brought to the use of the performers.

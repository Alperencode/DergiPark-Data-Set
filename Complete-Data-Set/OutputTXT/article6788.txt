Makale Başlığı: Validity and Reliability of the Turkish Version of the Self-Stigma Scale in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes
Özet: Aim: To analyze the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Self-Stigma Scale (SSS-T), which will help determine the barriers to participation in social life in type 2 diabetes patients.Material and Methods: Necessary permissions were obtained to carry out this methodological study.  The research was conducted in a private hospital in Istanbul, with 180 people with type 2 diabetes in 2019. Data were collected with the Patient Identification Form, SSS-T, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Confirmatory factor analysis, content reliability, test-retest reliability, and Cronbach’s alpha analysis were used to analyze the data.Results: Due to the recommendations of experts, language validity, and pilot study findings, 11, 14, and 39 questions were removed from the scale. The scale consisted of 3 sub-dimensions, including cognitive, affective, and behavioral, which explained 61.37% of the total variance. The Cronbach’s of the SSS-T was 0.96 for the total score. Cronbach’s alpha scores for cognitive, affective, and behavioral subscales were 0.92, and 0.87, respectively. Test-retest analysis to analyze time invariance revealed a significant relationship between the mean scores (p<0.05). There was a moderately negative significant relationship between the total scores of RSES and SSS-T (r=-0.62). Conclusion: As a result of the explanatory factor analyses, it was seen that the results were close to the original version, and the Turkish version of the SSS-T was valid and reliable for the Turkish language in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.

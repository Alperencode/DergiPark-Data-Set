Makale Başlığı: The Ottoman Printers’ 8 Point Naskh Typeface and its Turkish Type Maker Mehmed Emin Efendi
Özet: This paper discusses the 8 point (pt) naskh typeface created in Istanbul between1870 and 1875 and utilized by Ottoman printers during the late 19th and early20th centuries. In the 1880s, Ottoman printed material began to display a moresophisticated typographic hierarchy, with the proliferation of typefaces invarious styles and point sizes being the main reason for this visual development.The historical analysis of Ottoman Arabic typefaces reveals the existence ofnine original naskh typefaces that were created and used from 1729 until the1928 Turkish script reform. Among these nine fonts, the 8 pt naskh typefacedistinguished itself by its size as the smallest Arabic type used by Ottoman printers, earning it a crucial role in page layout design. It was first utilized in the 1875 pocket book, Hilye-i Hakani.This study focuses on the visual and historical development of the 8 pt naskh typeface and sheds light on its creator,Mehmed Emin Efendi and uses archival documents to scrutinize the driving force for its creation. Due to the absenceof metal types, this paper examines only the printed form of types found in journals, newspapers, and books.

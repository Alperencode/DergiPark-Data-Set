Makale Başlığı: DEVELOPMENT OF INTUITIVE THINKING SCALE: VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY STUDY
Özet: Intuition can be defined as the emergence of knowledge, which is at the core of human existence, by taking its source and inspiration from vital activities, generally independent of time and space. Intuitive thinking, in addition to creating a unity in terms of its qualities, also undertakes the task of opening the door to all other forms of thinking. In this respect, intuitive thinking skills are very important in acquiring many features such as academic success, discovery and creativity in the education process. This research is a quantitative study in the survey pattern, in which it is aimed to develop a scale to detect the intuitive thinking characteristics of high school students. After the item pool was created for the scale development process in the research, language and content validity studies were carried out. The data of the study were collected from students studying at the high school level of public schools in Onikişubat district of Kahramanmaraş province, 414 students for the pilot study, 650 for the EFA and 264 for the CFA. The four-dimensional structure obtained as a result of EFA was tested with CFA and it was determined that the fit values of the 22-item scale were sufficient, and the Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients of the dimensions and the overall scale were high. As a result of the analyzes, it was concluded that the Intuitive Thinking Scale is a valid and reliable scale.

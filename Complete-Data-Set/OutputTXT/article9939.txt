Makale Başlığı: Çerkes Teavün Mektebi Müdürü Ahmed Cavid Paşa’nın Osmanlı Memur Sicil Kaydı [Ottoman official record that belongs to Ahmed Cavid Paşa, the manager of the Circassian Solidarity School]
Özet: This study mainly consists of the simplified transcription of the official record of Ahmed Cavid Paşa, which is among the BOA (Presidential Ottoman Archives) documents. As an Ottoman administrator who prioritized education, Ahmed Cavid Paşa took responsibility in this area and established societies in the settlements where he worked and made special efforts to make education widespread among the people, and personally engaged in activities to prepare educational materials. As an Ottoman intellectual of Circassian origin, he prepared a Circassian alphabet based on Ottoman Turkish and this alphabet was used as a Circassian teaching material in the Circassian Teavun School, of which he was the director. It has been tried to shed light on the conclusion that Ahmed Cavid Pasha's civil servant record can be evaluated as an extremely bright profile with the activities and concrete works he revealed both during his civil service period and his retirement years by being supported by the data in the Ottoman archive documents in order to be more understandable and detailed.

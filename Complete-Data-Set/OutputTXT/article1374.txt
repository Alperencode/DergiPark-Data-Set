Makale Başlığı: Comparison of the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical stimulation and interference current in patients with gonarthrosis
Özet: Aim: In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and interference current (IFC) modalities on pain, function and quality of life in the treatment of patients with gonarthrosis.Material and Method: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of TENS and IFC modalities on pain, function and quality of life in the treatment of patients with gonarthrosis and to compare them in terms of their superiority.Results: 80 patients were included in the study. In the TENS and IFC groups, the degree of active-passive knee flexion and extension increased significantly on the 15th day of treatment (T15th day) and at the 3rd month after treatment (AT 3rd month), while it was at a similar level between the 15th day and the 3rd month of treatment. In the comparison of the 15th day of the treatment and the 3rd month after the treatment, the increase in the active-passive flexion and extension measurements in the IFC group was found to be statistically significant (flexion T15th day p=0.007 AT 3rd month p=0.000, extansion T15th day p=0.004 AT 3rd month p=0.031). The decrease in WOMAC total value at the 15th day of the treatment and at the 3rd month after the treatment was found to be significantly decreased in the IFC group (T15th day p=0.013, AT 3rd month p=0.000).Conclusion: IFC both increased the range of motion of the knee joint in patients with gonarthrosis and contributed to the functional recovery in knee osteoarthritis.

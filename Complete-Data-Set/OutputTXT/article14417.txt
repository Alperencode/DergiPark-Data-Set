Makale Başlığı: Synthesis, Characterization and Investigation of Electrical Conductivity of Poly(2-Oxo-2-Phenyl Ethyl -2-Amino Benzoate)/Bentonite Nanocomposite
Özet: This study was carried out in two stages. In the first stage; 2-oxo-2-phenylethyl-2-aminobenzoate (OPA) compound, which was an aniline derivative, was synthesized by starting the appropriate components. Then, poly(OPA) was obtained via chemical polymerization of the OPA in the presence of ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) as the initiator and DMF as the solvent. Poly(OPA)/Bentonite (BNT) nanocomposite was synthesized by effectively dispersing the inorganic nanolayers of BNT in poly(OPA) matrix by means of intercalation method. In the second stage; the characterization of the synthesized OPA, poly(OPA) and poly(OPA)/BNT nanocomposite was investigated. The OPA was characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS). The structures of the poly(OPA) and nanocomposite(OPA) were characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the conductivity of poly(OPA)/BNT nanocomposite was investigated and change in electrical conductivity was examined.

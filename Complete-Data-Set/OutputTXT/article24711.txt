Makale Başlığı: Empirical Analysis on the Running Time of a Searching Algorithm, Chunk Algorithm
Özet: Searching and sorting, by no doubt, represent twoof the most fundamental and widely encountered problems in computer science.Given a collection of objects, the goal of search is to find a particularobject in this collection or to recognize that the object does not exist in thecollection. A major goal of computer sciences is to understand and develop asolution for the particular problem. Typically solving the problem involves at least four steps: (1) designan algorithm, (2) analyze the correctness and efficiency of the procedure, (3)implement that procedure in some programming language, and (4) test thatimplementation.  An important issue is todescribe the efficiency of a given procedure for solving a problem. Informally,usually we speak in terms of  “fast” or“slow” programs, but the absolute execution time of an algorithm depends onmany factors such as: the size of the input, the programming language used to implement the algorithm, the quality ofthe implementation and  the machine onwhich the code is run (a supercomputer is faster than a laptop). In this paperwe will analyze the performances of a searching algorithm, precisely the chunkalgorithm. In analyzing the efficiency of chunk algorithm, we will only concentrateon searching items, using the Chunk-Search Algorithm, on one-dimensional arrayswith integers. We wanted to see how does different chunk size, input size(i.e., the “speed” of the algorithm as a function of the size of the input onwhich it is run), and the machine on which the code is run.

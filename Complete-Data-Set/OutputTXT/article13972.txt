The data obtained as a result of factor analyzes show that the scale consists of a single factor. The percentage of variance of the scale consisting of a single factor was calculated as 81.94%.

Then, the revised scale and personal information form were applied to the parents of 168 middle school students for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The fit indices obtained as a result of the confirmatory factor analysis were found to be in agreement between the model and the data, and the proposed model showed good and acceptable fit.

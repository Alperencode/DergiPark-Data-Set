Makale Başlığı: Incidence of Second Hip Fractures and Associated Mortality: A Nationwide Population-based Study of 95,484 Patients during 2006-2010
Özet: Objectives Hip fractures result in serious medical and socioeconomic burden. The aim of current study is to determine the incidence and mortality of second hip fracture using a nationwide database.   Patients and methods   A nationwide epidemiological study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2001 to 2011. Patients older than 50 years with hip fractures from 2006 to 2011 were included in the study. A total of 95,484 hip fractures were identified, with subsequent second hip fracture occurred in 4,102 of them.   Results   The incidence rate ratio of second hip fracture showed a 7.13 fold of risk of further hip fracture in 3 months, 5.21 fold in one year, and remained more than 2 fold in the end of 6th year when compared with the general population. The 6-year cumulative incidence of a second hip fracture was higher in female (8.0%) than in male (6.2%). A significantly higher 1-year mortality rate was seen after a second hip fracture (18.8%) compared to the first hip fracture (14.1%) (p < 0.05). Men had higher 1- and 5-year mortality rates after second hip fractures (12.1% and 41.2%, respectively) than women (17.4% and 47.3%, respectively).  Conclusions   Patients with hip fractures would have a 2-7 fold of risk of a second fracture within 6 years. Women were more prone to a second hip fracture than men but men had a higher mortality rate. Our data provide information to health policymakers in Taiwan and countries with similar hip fracture incidence. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0277This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF 5E LEARNING MODEL ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: META-ANALYSIS
Özet: The 5E learning model, which is based on the constructivist approach, is applied in many fields, especially in science. The aim of this research is to meta-analyze the studies on the effect of the 5E learning model on academic achievement. Studies conducted between 2017 -2021 and meeting the criteria determined were included in the study pool. The descriptive features of the obtained data, the sample number of the experimental and control groups, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation data were coded. In addition, the course and teaching level in which the 5E model was applied were considered as moderator variables. The findings showed that the 5E learning model greatly affected academic achievement according to the random effects model. When examined in terms of moderator variables, it was seen that the effect size did not differ significantly according to the teaching level in which the 5E model was applied, while the effect level differed significantly according to the course in which the model was applied. Some suggestions were made based on the research findings.

Makale Başlığı: Character Comparison Visualization Of Natural Indicators In Alkalimetric Titration
Özet: The use of natural materials began to be developed on a large scale in chemistry. Natural substances are safe to use, easy to find, and cheaper. Biological indicators in volumetric titration are the focus of experts. This study presented a visualization of the alkalimetric titration of a weak acid with a strong base with the addition of natural indicators. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. and Clitoria ternatea L. flowers were used as titration indicators for diprotic acid, namely oxalic acid, with a strong base, sodium hydroxide. The phenolphthalein indicator was chosen as an indicator to compare. Maceration of flower crowns aimed to obtain biological indicator extracts. The titration was held three times for the Hibiscus flower, Clitoria flower, and phenolphthalein. The addition of flower crown extract to oxalic acid gave a pink color to the solution. There was a color change to clear when titrated. The color change indicated the endpoint of the titration. The addition of the flower crown extract indicator showed a relatively similar curve to the phenolphthalein indicator during titration. This result showed that the two flower crown extracts had the same function as phenolphthalein as an indicator for alkalimetric titration of a weak acid with a strong base.

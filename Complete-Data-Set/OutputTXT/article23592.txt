Makale Başlığı: The Role of Natural Mountain Minerals and Trace Elements in The Diet of Quails
Özet: In this research, it was examined the role of natural mountain minerals, microelements and vitamins in the diet of quails in the Ganja-Gazak region. The research was carried out on quails raised in private farms as well as Quail Breeding Training Center in the laboratory of the Treatment, Gynecology and Surgery department of the Veterinary Faculty of Azerbaijan State Agrar University. Studies have shown that quails need micronutrients and vitamins for all metabolic functions. The research was carried out on 600 quails and 300 quails were fed with Aydağ zeolite mixture in addition to their feed, while 300 were fed with normal feed. As a result of the experiment, it was determined that the addition of Aydağ zeolite to the feed made a positive contribution to the egg number and quail weight.

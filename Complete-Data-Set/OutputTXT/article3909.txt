Makale Başlığı: The Relation of Calamity and Consolation in the Qurʾān
Özet: Mankind encounters various misfortunes that negatively affect life such as fear, sometimes hunger, sometimes disease, and sometimes loss of life and property in the worldly life to which they are sent to be tested. As stated in many verses, while most of the calamities occur as a result of one's own bad deeds, some of them may be due to involuntary reasons that can be evaluated in the context of fate and testing. Troubles are very wearisome for human beings. In order to get rid of this psychology, to adapt to life again and return to normal life, a human needs a spiritual consolation. The Qurʾān has given important advice to believers, especially the Prophets, about the attitude they will take in the face of calamities and has made statements that would give them the strength to endure. In addition, in the Qurʾān, the causes and wisdoms of calamities are emphasized; It has been emphasized that calamities can be overcome with patience, faith, prayer, repentance and hope. A human who encounters calamities approaches or moves away from Allah with the attitudes and behaviours he exhibits. While calamities reveal the inability, weakness and impotence of human beings, on the other hand, their sincerity is measured and their degree in the sight of Allah is determined. In this study, it has been tried to reveal how the Qurʾān consoled Muslims in the face of calamities and how it gave them moral support in the context of calamity-consolation.

Makale Başlığı: On the Procession of the Great Mahomet, Manufacturing Prejudice: Published Fabrications - Alleged Translations of Ottoman Decrees
Özet: The subject of this paper is a series of variants on an alleged translation into English first published in the late 17th c. of what was said to be an ordinance-order-command-proclamation-decree, a firman, allegedly issued in consequence of Ottoman military defeats, by the Ottoman Sultans Süleyman II. (1687-1691), Mustafa II. (1695-1703), and Ahmed III. (1703-1730), for fasting throughout Ottoman territory on Mondays and Fridays by all Ottoman subjects, and, a procession to be held three times in three consecutive months at Mecca. This procession was to transport the coffin of the Prophet Mohammed over a distance of 20 or 10 or 25 miles, with lamentations and flagellations and a number of human sacrifice per mile, all specified in the alleged Order of Procession, to obtain the intercession of the Prophet Muhammed with the Almighty to ensure the future success of Ottoman arms. Published in English as a broadside pamphlet in 1687, and then in a journal article entitled Advice From Turky –News from Turkey in 1697, but which are in fact examples of black propaganda. This series of alleged Ottoman decrees was published in English in variant forms in a variety of publications over the course of nearly two centuries. Doubtless many readers over these two centuries believed the allegations made in these alleged Ottoman decrees to be true, not the malicious fabrications they are, thereby reinforcing the illusion of truth concerning the bigotry and barbarity of “the Other”.

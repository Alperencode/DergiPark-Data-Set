Makale Başlığı: A Rhetorical Image of the Biggest Poets of the Pre-Islamic Poetry
Özet: This research is aimed to study the works of four fathers of pre-Islamic poetry, namely, Imra' ul-Qais, Zuhair, Al-Nabigha Al-Dhubyani and Al-A'sha, and highlight the role of the aesthetic image in sparking off the poetic scenes. The researcher sought to examine the aesthetic image including simile, metaphors and metonymy as materialized in the works of these four poets. The research benefits from conducting a comprehensive census that shows the subtle differences of the “rhetorical graphic” arts among the poets surveyed, by measuring the proportion of each rhetorical art of each poet, and the proportion of its subdivisions. In addition to making a comparison between the four poets to know the differences in the percentage of those arts and its affiliated branches, and thus the individual characteristics of each poet's science of rhetoric are manifested, and the common features among the four poets.

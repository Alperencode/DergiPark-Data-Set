Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Power Generation Plants with Blackstart on Power System Restoration after Blackout
Özet: Power systems are complex structures that provide uninterrupted delivery of electrical energy to the consumer and are expressed as the sum of equipment operated in coordination with each other. However, in some cases, a complete or partial system collapse may occur in the power system. While this system blackout can sometimes be fixed immediately, sometimes it takes a long time to fix it. After long interruptions, social life, daily activities and production activities are interrupted; This leads to a huge financial loss. After a system blackout of the entire power system, elaborate power system restoration plans should be implemented immediately. The location and capacity of blackstart power generation units, which play a critical role in the restoration of the power system, are of great importance in deciding the restoration strategy to be applied after the system blackout. In this study, a simulation study was conducted using real data in order to understand the importance of power generation plants with recovery feature in the system restoration after the complete collapse of the power system. In this study, the behavior of power generation units during the application phases of system collapse and system restoration was investigated. Information is given about the points to be considered while preparing power system restoration plans.

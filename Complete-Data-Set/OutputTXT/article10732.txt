Makale Başlığı: Assesing The Effect Of The Works Of Art History On Contemporary Artistic Designs Based On The Concepts Of Pastiche And Parody
Özet: Art history is a series of interactions that have been approaching since life. Humanity is a choice of its own or of its own communities. The products in the antique production facilities influenced the Renaissance, the art products and designs of the periods after the Renaissance design designs. In today's art, the development of technology has made communication even more powerful. The simultaneous spread of artistic designs and images to the world increased interaction and contributed to the development of pastiche and parody. Pastiche (emulation) is called a method that takes place in the formation phase of the work of art. Another method in the postmodern period is Parody (reflection). While the works produced by pastiche are respectful to the artist, the works produced by parody display a cynical and humorous attitude. The pastiche, which shows respect to the artist and the work of art, has given birth to the parody, which is the opposite of itself. When considered as a form of pastiche and parody, which are the defining elements of postmodern teaching, it is used as a method of citation in branches of art. The artists who produced the work inspired the artists after them and gave them a perspective. These methods, which bring meaning/concepts to art by bringing new searches and interpretations, mostly appear in the postmodern period and allow us to understand and interpret the reproduced works.

Makale Başlığı: Using Humor as a Strategy to Express Organizational Dissent
Özet: The study aims to examine the effect of individuals' use of humor on organizational dissent behaviors. This study, which was carried out with academic and administrative staff in various units of a state university, it was investigated which type of dissent individuals exhibited when reporting their dissatisfaction and whether they used humor as a dissenting message. As a result of the regression analyses carried out with the data collected from 152 academic and administrative personnel, it was determined that the way individuals use humor affects the display of organizational dissent behaviors. It has been observed that when individuals have a self-enhancing humor style, they follow an articulated dissent strategy and move away from displaced dissent behavior.

Özet: Program evaluation studies provide the development of dynamic, contemporary, and qualified education programs and the improvement of present educational programs. In this direction, institutions should carry out program evaluation studies in order to create dynamic programs that can meet the expectations, needs, and requests of all stakeholders. In line with the evidences obtained from these evaluation results, developed or improved education programs can be formed that will guide future education and can prepare students for the future. Program evaluation is a systematic and continuous process in which quantitative and qualitative research methods are used regarding all components of the program. In this review, the program evaluation process is detailed in 3 stages as planning, implementation, and evaluation. In this direction, the steps to be taken at that stage are explained for each stage. The purpose of this review is to present a roadmap that nurse educators can use to carry out the program evaluation process in evaluating nursing programs. In addition, the CIPP (Context, Input, Process, Product) program evaluation model used in nursing education programs was given as an example of a program evaluation model.

Makale Başlığı: Thermodynamic Assessment of the Impact of Pregnancy and Lactation on the Longevity of Women
Özet: Effects of the pregnancy and the following lactation periods on the lifespan entropy of the women has been evaluated. In the case of singleton pregnancy, a wealthy woman may generate 1.5% and in the case of twin pregnancy 2.1% of the total lifespan entropy of a non-pregnant wealthy women. In the case of a poor woman the singleton pregnancy, may generate 1.8% and in case of the twin pregnancy 2.1% of the total lifespan entropy generated by the non-pregnant wealthy woman. Results of the diet-based thermodynamic calculations for the poor women are compared with the demographic data collected across pre-industrial Europe and a good agreement was found.

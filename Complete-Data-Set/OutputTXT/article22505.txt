Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Parents' Attitudes Towards Child  Sexual Abuse Prevention Education
Özet: The main purpose of this study is to obtain more information about parents' thoughts on sexual abuse prevention education. One hundred and eighty parents whose children were between 3 and 6 years old participated in the study group of the research. Research data were collected with a questionnaire prepared by the researcher. It was determined that although most of the parents (70%) gave their children sexual abuse prevention education, they still needed more information and guidance by reliable specialists. In addition, parents need de velopmentally appropriate educational materials. It has been determined that parents stay away from talking about this issue with their children due to some anxiety and fears. Parents need expert support, appropriate material, and to feel competent and trustworthy in this regard. It was also determined that they thought that they could teach their children to protect themselves from sexual abuse with more information and support in the future. It is thought that more information and awareness studies should be carried out to help parents who state that they do not provide any education to understand that all children are at potential risk of sexual abuse and that victimization can occur at any age.

Makale Başlığı: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: The Paris Meetings of the Allies on the Turco-Greek War (20-23 September 1922)
Özet: The Mudanya Armistice and the Lausanne Peace Treaty have without doubt a prominent place in the history of the Turkish National Struggle. Thus, there have been many studies and publications to this date which have dealt with all aspects of the Armistice and the Lausanne. It is for this reason that the current study will not deal with the armistice and the Lausanne itself. Rather, as stated in the title, the study will look at Allies’ meetings in Paris on the Turco-Greek War on 20-23 September 1922. More specifically, it will investigate how the British, French, and Italian statesmen (such as Lord Curzon, Poincaré, and Kont Sforza) evaluated the Turco-Greek War, the armistice and the peace conference. On 20 September, Lord Curzon went to Paris to discuss the matters with the French Prime Minister, Poincaré and Italian counterpart.

Makale Başlığı: A Current Evaluation on the Importance of Traditional Building Masters and the Training of Restoration Practitioners Working in the Conservation of Architectural Heritage in Turkey
Özet: Preservation of the cultural assets with their authentic values and their transfer to the future is directly related to the quality of the conservation and restoration interventions, and therefore to the training and knowledge of the implementers who carry out these interventions. Qualified workforce is an indispensable necessity in this field, which requires special experience and expertise. In this sense, the existence and recognition of traditional masters -who have knowledge, skills and experience in traditional architecture, construction techniques and materials-, their ability to transfer this knowledge to future generations, and the training of young generations as qualified practitioners are of great importance.In this study, traditional construction crafts are evaluated in the context of intangible cultural heritage, the issue of identifying existing traditional building masters and ensuring their recognition is brought to the agenda, efforts to raise new generations within the framework of formal and non-formal education are discussed, problems related to professional qualifications are presented and framework suggestions are presented. In the study, the findings are based on the legal frameworks on the subject, the data announced by the relevant institutions and the experience gained from the initiatives in which the authors themselves took part.As a result of the findings presented, it is foreseen that the preservation of traditional buildings and construction crafts can be achieved primarily by ensuring the recognition of existing traditional construction masters and securing the environment in which they can transfer their experiences, increasing the application weight of formal education, ensuring the continuity of non-formal education, and employing professionally qualified masters and intermediate staff in practices. It is hoped that this study, which focuses on the education of the people involved in the restoration practices of the cultural assets and the continuity of traditional building mastery, will shed light on the future in the field of architectural conservation.

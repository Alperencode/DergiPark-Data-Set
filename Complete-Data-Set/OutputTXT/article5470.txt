Makale Başlığı: Effect of Freezing and Smoking on The Proximate and  Mineral Composition of Flat Sardinella (Sardinella Eba)
Özet: A study was conducted to determine and compare the effects of freezing and smoking on the proximate and mineral composition of Sardinella eba. The results of the proximate composition were observed to be higher in the smoked fish samples compared to the frozen samples, with all parameters significant higher (P<0.05) in the smoked samples than in the frozen samples apart from moisture content. Eight minerals were quantified in S. eba, including five macro minerals (Ca, K, P, Na, and Mg) and three trace minerals (Fe, Zn, and Mn). The mineral content values of the smoked fish samples in all the parameters studied were statistically significantly higher than in the frozen fish samples, particularly for the trace minerals such as Zn and Mn, than in the smoked samples. In conclusion, the information obtained in this study could be useful to fish consumers, processors, and nutritionists in the efficient post-harvest management of fish resources.

Makale Başlığı: OPTIMIZATION of MACHINING PARAMETERS for BORON ALLOY STEEL by PLUNGE ELECTRO EROSION by TAGUCHI TECHNIQUE
Özet: In this study, the machinability of Boron Alloy Steel by electrical discharge machining (EDM) method was investigated. Taguchi L27 vertical knee test set was used in the experimental study. Discharge current, pulse on time, and pulse of time were selected as processing parameters. As a result of the experiments, average surface roughness, material removal rate, electrode wear rate values were investigated. The Taguchi method was used to decide on the optimal machining parameters. The effect of control factors on experimental results was calculated using analysis of variance. In the results of the experimental studies, the discharge current was found to be the most effective parameter on the electrode wear rate (EWR), average surface roughness (Ra) and material removal rate (MRR), It has been shown that increasing the discharge current (I) value will have a negative effect on Ra. The factors affecting the average surface roughness after calculation are 86.51% discharge current, 6.17% pulse on time and 0.2% pulse off time. It was concluded that the effects of the impact time and the impact waiting time on the average surface roughness were insignificant. For MRR, the discharge current is 75.56%, the pulse on time is 9.54%, and the pulse off time is 2.03%. For EWR, the discharge current is 52.87%, toff with 6.25%, and ton with 3.25%

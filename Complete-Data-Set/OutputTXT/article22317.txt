Makale Başlığı: A Comparison of Mentality Worlds Through the Relationship between Hyperrationalism and Unemployment in Costa-Gavras's Le Couperet and Erdem Tepegöz's Zerre
Özet: Purpose of the study: The aim of this study is to examine hyperrationalism, from the simulation theory put forward by Jean Baudrillard, through two movies, and to evaluate the reflections of this concept in two different mentality worlds over the unemployment problem. The point that Baudrillard emphasizes is that although the western world lives in the simulation universe, there are still non-modernized societies that are not immanent to the simulation universe due to the historical process difference. In this context, Costa Gavras’ Le Couperet and Erdem Tepegöz’s Zerre are the subjects of this study.Literature Background: The theoretical framework of this study is Jean Baudrillard's simulation theory and a concept of the theory, 'hyperrationalism'. In this study, 'simulation theory' will be evaluated in the context of the relationship between cinema and sociology, and unemployment representations in sample films will be discussed on the basis of historical process and difference in mentality worlds.Method: The fact that the study is a qualitative study and has an interdisciplinary approach points to the descriptive method. In this way, a plane that is free from harsh methodological constraints and limitations will be built, and philosophical meaning outputs will not be overlooked.Findings: The findings obtained in the study are that the historical process difference between France and Turkey and the related mentality worlds create a difference in the hyperrational mind's activation and circulation, and the perspective on the unemployment problem varies.Conclusion: As a result, it is seen that Bruno, in Le Couperet, resorts to hyperrational, absurd and amoral solutions, while in the movie Zerre it is seen that Zeynep, lives under difficult life conditions, does not engage in any hyperrational or even irrational action. This contrast between the two films is related to the effect of the historical process difference between the French and Turkish society in the context of thyperrationalism.

Makale Başlığı: Association of spinal cord lesions with cognition in multiple sclerosis
Özet: Purpose: The effect of spinal cord involvement, which is closely related to physical disability and prognosis, on cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis.  Materials and Methods: Twenty nine MS patients (2 clinically isolated syndrome, 23 relapsing and remitting MS, 2 secondary progressive MS, 2 primary progressive MS) were included in the study. Demographic characteristics, expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, cognition assessed by brief repeatable battery of neuropsychological tests, brain and spinal cord T2 lesion number were evaluated. Results: Older age, later age of disease onset, education duration are the features affecting cognitive test results. Brain and spinal cord lesion numbers did not have any effect on cognitive tests. Patients with spinal cord lesions had higher EDSS compared to patients without, however there was no difference regarding cognitive test results between groups. Conclusion: Spinal cord lesions are associated with physical disability quantified by EDSS. Longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to investigate the effect of presence and number of cord lesions as well as cervical cord atrophy on cognitive test results.

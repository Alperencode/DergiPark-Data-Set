Makale Başlığı: The Place of Women in Kant’s Philosophy
Özet: In his critical works, Kant developed a discourse for all rational beings without any gender discrimination; but his normative works contain some judgments about the sexes. Due to the definitions in his normative works such as  Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, On Pedagogy,  Kant's philosophical texts are criticized that they only target the male gender or that they exclude women from the rational being category. According to some of the researchers who criticize Kant's determinations, women are not even seen as moral agents. On the other hand, Kant does not have a discourse that women are not moral agents or that they are excluded from the class of rational beings. It cannot be said that Kant is completely far from making a sexist discourse, but there is no premise that requires evaluating all philosophical texts in terms of genders. This study aims to place the propositions in a general framework by examining Kant's criticized propositions in terms of text integrity, concept contents and contexts and to show that Kant does not stand as an obstacle to women's freedom.

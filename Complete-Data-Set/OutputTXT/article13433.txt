Makale Başlığı: A Different Perspective to Artificial Intelligence Technologies from Nursing Education and Nursing Process Perspective
Özet: It is seen that artificial intelligence and nursing discussions are generally limited to the ethical dilemmas about the fact  robots will replace nurses in the future and that this may create in health care. Increasing expectations of both service providers and service recipients for technologically-based individualized care in the transforming healthcare system make it more and more necessary for nurses to recognize artificial intelligence applications and to be involved in this process. Therefore, it is important to expand the boundaries of the topics discussed in the context of artificial intelligence and nursing and to develop a different perspective towards the current need. In this review, it is aimed to raise awareness about artificial intelligence applications from the perspective of nursing education and nursing process, to capture the relationship between the nursing process and artificial intelligence from a different point, and to present approaches on how nurses can be involved in the development and use of artificial intelligence applications from the education process.

Makale Başlığı: Comments on the Content Criticism of Ibn al-Jawzī in His Kitāb al-Mawḍū’āt
Özet: Contrary to popular belief, Iran's ancient religion, Zoroastrianism, goes back much earlier than Zoroaster. Although Zoroaster's being both a prophet and a priest has an important role in this, the main factor is that the beliefs based on the ancient Aryans were continued by the clergy after Zoroaster. Although there are different dates for the emergence of Zoroaster, today's researchers such as Mary Boyce, Albert de Jong, and Frantz Grenet agree between the twentieth century BC and the tenth century BC with reference to the etymology of the Gatas. It is known that after the appearance of Zoroaster, Iranian clergy showed regional differences in rituals and were called by different names. However, it is estimated that they united under the name of magi over time and especially just before the emergence of the Sassanid State. Our study focuses on the influence of the magians on Iran and Zoroastrianism, as well as their religious and ethnic origins, rituals, religious and secular activities, and their effectiveness outside Iran. However, since the clergy gained an institutional identity in post-Sassanid Iran and was divided into different branches under the name of muğ, it was not included in this study. On the other hand, we consider that this study will shed some light on the background of the activities of the ancient clergy in Sassanid and Islamic period Iran.

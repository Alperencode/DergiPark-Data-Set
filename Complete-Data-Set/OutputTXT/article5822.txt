Makale Başlığı: FOUNDER FUNCTION OF THE LANGUAGE IN LACAN AND LEVINAS
Özet: The order of language emerges in the system of thought where the subject is located  for Levinas and the subject is reconstituted for Lacan as well. The subject is a social subject categorized in terms prescribed by the social/symbolic order; for it relates to the other first and foremost on a symbolic and social level. When it confronts the other, it forms its identity in the symbolic space, by self-actualization through language. The subject is a linguistic order in which moments of resistance are created through itself against the domination of the totality of being; hence the order of language is a field of harmony and resistance, a field of unity and infinity. Language is a fundamental component of a system of thought in which the subject finds himself regulated by one system of laws and meanings by another. For both thinkers, language is constructively intersubjectiv.

Makale Başlığı: Exploratory laparotomic diagnosis of renal cystic echinococcosis in a domestic cat from Hatay province of Türkiye and its molecular confirmation
Özet: This case report was prepared to provide information about cystic echinococcosis detected in a twelve years old domestic cat during experimental laparotomy. In the anamnesis, there was a complaint of progressive abdominal swelling. As a result of clinical and radiological examinations, unknown intraabdominal formations were detected. At laparotomy, multiple cysts were detected on the right and left kidneys. Molecular analysis revealed that these cystic structures are larval forms of Echinococcus granulosus. The cysts are often found in the liver and lungs but they can arise less commonly in the brain, kidneys, muscle, bone and heart. Renal cystic echinococcosis is rare and this note describes it, confirmed by molecular analysis in a domestic cat. For this reason, it is thought that this note will contribute to the literature.

Makale Başlığı: Examination of Factors Affecting General Survival in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer: A Case of Dokuz Eylül University Medical Oncology Clinic
Özet: Aim: Despite many new generation treatments, it is known that the prognostic markers used to datein patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), who have a very poor prognosis, can not accurately determine the prognosis in every patient. Therefore, the search for prognostic biomarkers continues. In this study, it was aimed toinvestigate the effect of pre-treatment biochemical parameters on oncological outcomes in mRHC patients.Material and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical, pathological, survival characteristics and factors affecting survival of 90mRCC patients who were metastatic (stage 4) or local (stage 1-3) at the time of diagnosis in our clinic, who underwent radical nephrectomyand relapsed during follow-up. Descriptive statistical analyzes of patients' demographic, clinicopathological and treatment characteristicswere performed.Results: 21.2% of the patients were female and 78.8 % were male. There was no difference in median OS (overall survival) between womenand men. The median OS duration was statistically significantly lower in patients with metastasis at the time of diagnosis (p=0.001). While themedian OS was 36.2 months in metastatic patients at the time of diagnosis, the median OS was 90.4 months in patients with recurrence atfollow-up. As the ratio of alkaline phosphatase/Albumin (ALP/ALB) increased, survival decreased (p=0.038). While the median OS of thosewith a CRP/ALB ratio of <0.072 was 91 months, this period was limited to 51 months in those with a CRP/ALB ratio of >0.072 (AUC.630p=0.046 cut off:0.072).Conclusion: It has been determined that the CRP/ALB ratio is a biomarker that determines the prognosis. We recommend immunotherapyin patients who progress after first-linetargettherapy. Today, prognosis has become important especially in the treatment decision of mRCC,and we think that our study will shedlight on the search for new prognostic markers.

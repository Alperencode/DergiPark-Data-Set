Özet: Aim: Respectful maternity care means the care recommended by the World Health Organization for all women, protecting women's dignity and privacy, avoiding harm and ill-treatment, and providing continuous support during the conscious choice and birth process. Our aim with this study, which we took the first step to raise awareness on this issue, is to determine the views of student midwives on "respectful maternity care" during the birth process. Subject and Method: The research was qualitatively conducted with the students of the Midwifery Department of a state university in February 2022. The sample number was determined by criterion-based sampling, which is one of the purposeful sampling types, and the saturation point was reached in 15 students. The data were collected by conducting in-depth interviews with a questionnaire prepared by the researchers. Content analysis method was used in the analysis of the data. Results: The opinions of the students participating in the study on respectful maternity care during the birth process were gathered under three themes: "Defining respectful maternity care", "Respectful maternity care components" and "The importance of respectful maternity care". Under the theme of respectful maternity care components, in parallel with the literature, sub-themes of "Avoiding ill-treatment, Non-discrimination, Effective communication, Access to social support, obtaining informed consent, supporting women's fertility, providing continuous midwifery care" were collected. Conclusion: In this study, it was concluded that midwife students are aware of the importance of factors such as providing confidentiality about respectful maternity care to women, effective communication, avoiding ill-treatment, and providing quality midwifery care during the birth process and they think that they can do many things in their working life.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of heat shock proteins in certain Bacillus species
Özet: In this study, the effects of four different temperatures on the sporulation and development of 6 Bacillus species, 2 native and 4 reference were investigated. The SDS PAGE analysis emerged that two different proteins, 40 and 39 kilodalton (kDa), were produced by Bacillus sphaericus ATCC 2362 after 24 and 48, respectively hours at 48°C, by local isolate 4 after 24 and 48 hours at 42°C and by local isolate 31 after 24 and 48 hours at 48°C. Additionally Bacillus firmus (ATCC 14573) produced a 40 kDa protein after 48 hours at 52°C and Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis produced a 42 kDa protein after 48 hours at 42°C. At temperatures of 48 and 52°C, after 12, 24 and 48 hours incubation, vegetative and heat resistant spore counts were determined to reduce by 104-106 fold according to bacterial counts. As a result, the data revealed that at 48 and 52°C spore vitality fell by a significant degree. Additionally, SDS PAGE analysis results showed that high temperature resistance was provided by different heat shock proteins a 40 kDa protein produced by B. firmus ATCC (14573), 40-39 kDa proteins produced by B. sphaericus (ATCC 2362), and local isolates 4 and 31 and 42 kDa protein produced by B. thuringiensis var. israelensis.

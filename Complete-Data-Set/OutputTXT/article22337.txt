In the modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) technique used in the packaging of milk and dairy products, by changing the gas composition inside the package, the freshness of the product and microbial safety are protected. In smart packaging, by using indicators, sensors and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, monitorability of milk and dairy products throughout storage is provided, and economic losses are reduced. With the help of the active absorbing-conserving systems and active secreting-distributing systems they have, active packages prevent unwanted microbial developments, oxidations and color changes, and their effectiveness is increased by supporting them with antimicrobial substances and antioxidants. Edible films and coatings that are obtained from natural sources and can be consumed with foods are applied on milk and dairy products with different methods such as submersion, spraying, pouring and painting, they prevent chemical and microbiological degradations by keeping the humidity and oxygen amount in the package on the desired levels, and they do not pose a risk for the environment. This review study provides information on the MAP technique, smart packaging, active packaging and edible films and coatings that are used in the dairy industry.

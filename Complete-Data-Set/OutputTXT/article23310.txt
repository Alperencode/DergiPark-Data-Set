Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS of BIOMASS FLY ASH IN MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE COMPOSTING
Özet: In this study, the effect of biomass fly ash (BFA) as co-amendment was assessed on compost maturity and reduction of N loss during municipal solid waste (MSW) composting. Composting experiments were conducted using three ratios of BFA (0, 5 and 10%) in three in-vessel composting reactors for 105 days. MSW showed lower C/N ratio and higher moisture content  for composting. Thermophilic temperatures could not be reached in MSW treatment. However, co-amendment of BFA and MSW extended the thermophilic stage and promoted compost maturity. Nitrogen loss from reactors co-amended by BFA and MSW were reduced by compared with the control. While nitrogen loss was 62.75% in MSW treatment, it was 31.58% in 5% BFA treatment and 28.09% in 10% BFA treatment. The results demostrated that 10% BFA could be a suitable additive to improve the quality of MSW composting.

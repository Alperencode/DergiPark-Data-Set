Makale Başlığı: The Crime of Theft in the Zâhirite School of Islamic Law
Özet: : Islam, which prohibits all kinds of attacks on life, generation, mind, religion and property, In this way, he protected the dignity and honor of the human being, has also introduced some deterrent measures in order to prevent attacks against them. Theft, which is a crime against property, is included in the hadd crimes in Islamic criminal law. However, Islamic jurists argue that the act that is the subject of theft is considered a crime and the criminal sanction takes place; they sought a number of conditions regarding the property that is the subject of the crime, the location of this property, the way in which the crime was committed and the person who committed the act, they differed on some issues. In this article, he came to the fore with the principle of being content with the outward provisions of the verses in Islamic law It has been tried to deal with the approaches of the Zahiri sect, which represents the final level of the opposition of. The apparentism of this madhhab means (zahir) that the nass are content with only their verbal meanings in obtaining the shari'a decrees. These characteristics of the Zahirites are clearly seen in their approach to the crime of theft. Because they are content with the apparent meaning of the verse about the crime of stealing. Therefore, in case that the property is stolen from a close relative, state treasury or a protected place etc., they, unlike the other madhhabs, argue the view that hudud penalties should be applied to the offender.

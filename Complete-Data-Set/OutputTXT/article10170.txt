Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF AIR QUALITY IN TURKEY IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19
Özet: Air pollution is mainly expressed as a negative change in the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. The chemical, physical and biological substances that cause this change are called air pollutants. Although there are various natural factors that reveal these substances, it is mainly due to human activity. The measures taken under the Covid-19 outbreak are believed to have led to a narrowing in these activities. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether there has been a change in the period of the Covid-19 epidemic in the air quality of Turkey. For this purpose, air quality of selected provinces in Turkey between April 2019 and March 2021, covering the before Covid-19 and Covid-19 period, is analyzed by TOPSIS method using PM10, O3, NO2 and SO2 variables. The date range used in the study is divided into four different periods. The difference between periods in terms of variables is checked by the Kruskall-Wallis H and Tamhane’s T2 tests. As a result of the analysis, it is determined that there was a partial improvement in the air quality of the selected provinces in the Covid-19 period. It is concluded that both seasonal changes and the measures taken within the scope of the Covid-19 epidemic are also effective on this improvement.

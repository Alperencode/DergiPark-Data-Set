Makale Başlığı: Risk Assessment Application with FMEA Method in Universal and CNC Controlled Lathe Machines
Özet: Developing technology and production needs are increasing the need for the machinery metal production sector. On the lathe machine, is one of the most widely used machines in metal production sector, work accidents and serious occupational diseases occur every year. In order to prevent this, it has become a necessity to create an occupational safety culture in general. In order to prevent the existing hazards and possible accidents in small and large enterprises in the sector, it is necessary to identify them first and to make an effective risk assessment in order to offer solutions. When making a risk assessment, it becomes clear that the risk arising from a hazard in any machine cannot be ignored, that all dangerous situations should be revealed in detail and necessary solutions should be proposed accordingly. In this study, the existing hazards and risks in terms of occupational health and safety of universal and CNC lathes used in a university laboratory were revealed, risk assessment was carried out with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method and risk priority numbers were calculated. While 6 important risks and 4 fundamental risks were determined for the universal lathe, 1 possible risk, 5 important risks and 1 essential risk were determined for the CNC lathe. According to these results, corrective actions were determined to prevent hazards and solution suggestions were presented. We think that this study will make positive contributions to occupational health and safety in the use of lathes, which are both in manufacturing workshops and used for educational purposes in laboratories.

Makale Başlığı: A Study on the Finite Element Method and Volume and Load Analysis in Buildings to be Constructed in Masonry Style
Özet: If it is desired to create a building model that is suitable to be designed according to the situation of the land in the zoning plans, whether it is normal or in accordance with the historical urban texture, some feasibility studies are definitely needed. Especially in the restoration work of a historical building in accordance with the old texture or in the construction of a 2- or 3-storey building such as H = 6.50 meters in vineyard or garden areas, the ground and upper floor are stone, masonry construction projects, by making a modelling with the finite element method in the calculations of the structure. In the volumetric sense, load combinations such as dead load, live load, soil load, water load are calculated. Wall analysis are made on the stone foundation on the ground and upper floors of the masonry building. Finite element method was applied in the study. Finite elements are creating the modelling of a structure by creating connection and nodal points. With this method, especially the SAP program is used. In our study, the analysis results about the necessity of all load combinations and how the wall loads of the stone foundation on the ground will be minimum in a building to be built in a masonry style were examined.

Makale Başlığı: Virtue Signaling: A Conceptual Framework
Özet: Virtue signaling, which has become popular over the last few years, is originally derived from signal theory and refers to a pretentious behavior associated with unreliable signals. This term is the behavior of individuals or organizations to announce their dubious well-intentioned thoughts and beliefs in real life, in an easy way, face-to-face or through various media, with the aim of being perceived in a sensitive, virtuous and responsible manner in the eyes of the society. In this study, it is aimed to define the concept of virtue signaling in detail, to determine how this concept is exhibited in various applications, thus to expand the Turkish literature. The literature review technique was used in the study. As a result of the research, it has been understood that the virtue signaling behavior is exhibited through many common activities carried out under three main categories as individual, organizational and political. The concept of virtue signaling has passed into Turkish as a slang usage. The authors of this study suggest the use of another phrase that is thought to be more appropriate to use both in daily life and in the academic field, and which will not overshadow the careful use of the Turkish language. Since it is a new term, the scope of studies on this subject is limited. In the Turkish literature, however, there are no studies dealing with this term comprehensively. This study, which is prepared as a compilation, is expected to contribute to the domestic literature.

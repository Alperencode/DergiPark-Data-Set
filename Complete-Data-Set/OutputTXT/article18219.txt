Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Different Lens Solutions on the Vase Life of Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii cv. Amulet)
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of lens solutions known to have antimicrobial activity on the vase life of gerberas. 'Amulet' variety of Gerbera jamesonii Bolus ex Hooker f. was used as plant material. As a vase solution, 300 mgL-1 citric acid, 10 gL-1 sucrose and 4 different doses (0.5 mlL-1, 1 mlL-1, 2 mlL-1 ve 5 mlL-1) of two different lens solutions (Aqua Fresh with Bio True) and only 10gL-1 sucrose (negative control), 300mgL-1 citric acid and 10gL-1 sucrose (control) were used. Flower stem diameter, relative fresh weight, daily solution uptake, total solution uptake, vase life, microbial activity, and pH value of the vase solution were determined. The longest vase life was found in 2.0 Bio (15.22 days). This treatment increased the vase life by 3.56 days compared to the negative control and by 3.02 days compared to the control. 2.0 Bio was in the same statistical group with the 2.0 Aqua in terms of vase life. They also increased the relative fresh weight, daily solution uptake, and total solution uptake and decreased the microbial growth in vase solutions. The results of the study showed that lens solutions can be alternative preservatives that can be used to increase the vase life of cut flowers.

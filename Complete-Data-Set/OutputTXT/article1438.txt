Makale Başlığı: The Commentary on The Ghazal of Nedîm’s “Misin Kâfir” Redif Lyric and Investigation in Terms of Structuralism
Özet: In this study, our aim is to examine Nedîm's ghazal with the redif “misin kâfir” with the classical commentary method, then to examine it with the Structuralism method, which emerged in the 20th century and showed itself in all areas of life, and to reveal the hidden aspects of the ghazal with the Structuralism method. The school of structuralism determines the semantic relations between these structures after grating the smallest building blocks that make up the text and aims to apply them to the whole. With this medhod, the school of structuralism not only examines the text, but also enables the stuedied text to be more understandable. The method, which progresses from part to whole, helps to determine the structural, semantic, artistic, grammatical and aesthetic value of the ghazal. Before being examined by the researcher, a structural scaffold of the ghazal was drawn up in accordance with structuralism and the subjects to be examined were determined. This structural scaffold is important so that the text to be analyzed does not go beyond structuralism. The subjects of examination are related to the content of the ghazal rather that the external factors concerning the ghazal. Form, rhyme, languages and foreign words used in the ghazal, phrase types and compositions, sentence structures, letter types, personal pronouns and moods, semantic plan that make up the content, allusions and words formed the scaffolding in the study of the ghazal. The findings were interpreted by the commentator through tables and graphs.

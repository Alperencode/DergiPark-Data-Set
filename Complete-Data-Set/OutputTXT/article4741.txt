Makale Başlığı: EXPLORING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' PEER FEEDBACK BEHAVIORS USING PROCESS MINING
Özet: Peer feedback can benefit students in many ways. However, these benefits are minimal when the feedback is implemented as a one-way activity. These benefits can be multiplied if dialogue and collaboration among students are maintained before, during and after feedback. At this point, the active participation of the student giving the feedback is important. However, students' feedback-giving behaviour has not received much attention in the literature and has never been examined in dialogue-centred collaborative practices. In this study, attending this gap, the feedback behaviours of students in an online peer feedback activity were explored. This activity platform was carried out on the Synergy platform, which was designed within the framework of collaborative peer feedback theory, and data emerging from students’ interactions with this platform were examined by applying process mining. The pre-processing of the obtained big data were carried out on the basis of collaborative feedback theory. According to the results of the research, while the behaviours of the students in the high-performance group were compatible with the collaborative peer feedback theory, there were significant deviations from the theory in the behaviours of the middle-performing students. Findings indicate the importance of dialogue and collective planning between students prior to feedback. In addition, this study contributed to the debate on the lack of theory in the field of learning analytics by showing the benefits of grounding learning analytics in theory. Important recommendations were shared at the end of the study.

Makale Başlığı: How Well Do First Grade Students, Learning to Read and Write by Distance Education During the Pandemic Period, Write?
Özet: The aim of this study was to examine the handwriting legibility and writing errors of first grade primary school students who were learning early literacy through distance education during the pandemic period, according to various variables. The research was designed according to the survey method, and the study group consisted of 211 students studying in the first grade of primary school. The “Multidimensional Legibility Scale”, “Writing Errors Form”, “Dictation Text” and “Copying Text” were used as data collection tools in the research. For the analysis of the research data, the legibility of the first grade primary school students’ handwriting was analysed according to the “Multidimensional Legibility” scale. According to the results of the research, female students wrote more legibly than male students. Students made more writing errors in the dictation writing task than in the copying writing task. Students at state schools made more errors in their writing than students at private schools. Considering that the distance education process will also be a part of education life in later periods, research studies on the adequacy of the distance education process for fostering basic skills can be included in order to advance this process more beneficially, especially in primary school. The effect of distance education on handwriting legibility and writing errors at other grade levels can be investigated. Within the framework of the results obtained, different activities can be designed for writing skills in distance education.

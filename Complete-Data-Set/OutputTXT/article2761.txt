Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Different Reinforcement Ratios on Wear Behaviors in EN AW 5754 (AlMg3)/SiCp Composite Materials Produced with the Squeeze Casting Method
Özet: In this study, SiCp particles were reinforced at volumetric ratios of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% into the EN AW 5756 (AlMg3) metal matrix composite by using the squeeze casting method. The squeezing process was carried out for 10 seconds under a pressure of 80 MPa. The changes in the wear behaviors and friction coefficients of the EN AW 5754/SiCp composite samples were examined under1.0 N force, 5000 cycles and with a 0.04 m/s sliding speed. As a result of the experiments, it was found that the friction coefficient value increased from the non-reinforced alloy to the 10% SiCp-reinforced composite, while it then decreased in the 15% and 20% SiCp-reinforced composites. Moreover, the amount of wear in the composite material increased as the ratio of the reinforcement increased, and the highest wear occurred in the 10% SiCp-reinforced composite. This wear rate decreased in the 15% reinforced composite and then increased in the 20% reinforced composite. The deformation wear statuses of the composite materials that were used in the experiments were examined by conducting SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and EDS (Energy-Dispersive Spectrometry) analyses. In these examinations, it was observed that the 5% and 10% SiCp reinforcements did not show a homogeneous distribution in the matrix, but the 15% and 20% SiCp reinforcements were homogeneously distributed in the matrix material.

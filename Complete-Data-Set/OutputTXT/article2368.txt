Makale Başlığı: Overview of Probiotics Available in Pharmacies in Turkey
Özet: Objective: In this study, we aimed to provide a general assessment of the probiotic preparations actively sold in pharmacies in Turkey in December 2021 to health professionals and interested parties. Materials and Methods: We examined the probiotic preparations that were actively sold in pharmacies in Turkey in December 2021 by using the Rx Mediapharma® 2021 Interactive Drug Information Resource Program. Results: There were 249 preparations in the program. Most of them were capsules (n: 103). 39% of preparations contained one type of microorganism (n=97) and the rest more than one type. Genres of Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are the main content (84%) in the probiotic preparations. 97% of preparations were approved as Food Supplements by the Ministry of Agriculture, and 99% of the probiotics are sold without a prescription. 59% of them were imported. Conclusion: Probiotics are evaluated into categories as food/supplement that can claim or not claim to be beneficial to health, and probiotic drugs. The probiotics we examined are evaluated under the title of 'Nutritional Products' and are not separated according to the grouping in the consensus. Grouping and inspection by the Ministry of Health will make the use of probiotics safer.

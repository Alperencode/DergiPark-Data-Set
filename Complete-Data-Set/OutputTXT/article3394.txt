Makale Başlığı: Ideal convergence of a sequence of Chebyshev radii of sets
Özet: In this paper, we investigate the diameters, Chebyshev radii, Chebyshev self-radii and inner radii of a sequence of sets in the normed spaces. We prove that if a sequence of sets is I -Hausdorff convergent to a set, the sequence of Chebyshev radii of that sequence is I-convergent. Similar relations are showed for the sequence of diameters, Chebyshev self-radii and inner radii of that sequence.

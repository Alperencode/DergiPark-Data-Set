Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF ALOE-VERA EXTRACT ON THE CORROSION INHIBITION OF MEDIUM CARBON STEEL IN SEAWATER
Özet: Corrosion is said to be a function of the material and the environment it is exposed to. If that is the case, it follows therefore that corrosion inhibitor efficiency could also be a function of the material and the environment. This work focuses on the effect of aloe vera extract on 0.39%C steel in seawater. Aloe vera extracts of 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% concentrations gotten from 2kg of aloe vera plant were added to the corrosive media. They were exposed for a period of 1008th hours. The gravimetric and the potentiometer method was used for the analysis. The results from the gravimetric study shows that there was an increase in the inhibitor efficiency as the concentration of the extracts increased, but decreased with prolonged exposure time. Samples were retrieved from the environment at an interval of 168th hours. The extract was found to be more effective in seawater at 4% concentration with 85% inhibitor efficiency at 168th hour. The potentiometer results also affirmed that the sample with 4% aloe vera addition had the highest efficiency with about 97%. Though there was shift at both the anodic and cathodic slope, the inhibitor was observed to act more as an anodic inhibitor. The result therefore shows that aloe vera can act as an inhibitor to 0.39%C steel in seawater.

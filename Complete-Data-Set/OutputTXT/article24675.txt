Makale Başlığı: Numerical Investigation of the Effect of Twisted Tape in a Tube Using Water-TiO2 Nanofluid on Heat Transfer Enhancement
Özet: Inthis study, effects of inserting twisted tape into a horizontal tube and addingTiO2 nanoparticle to water on heat transfer enhancement performanceand pressure drop penalty are investigated with using CFD program. Analyses arecarried out with Reynolds number of in range from 7860 to 15860, and constantheat flux of 50kW/m2K is applied to wall of the tube. To simulate turbulentnanofluid flow k-ω standard turbulent model is applied for all cases. TiO2particles with diameter of 10 nm dispersed in water with volume fraction of0.2% - 2.0% are used as the working fluid. To create swirl flow and enhanceheat transfer, the twisted tape (constant twist ratio is y/W=3.0) is used inthis study. The results show that adding nanoparticle to water causes to getmore convective heat transfer coefficient as from 6% (for 0.2% vol. fract.) to11% (for 2.0% vol. fract.) in a smooth tube. Furthermore, both addingnanoparticle to water and inserting the twisted tape to the smooth tube causesto 1.44 times greater convective heat transfer coefficient than case of smoothtube and water. In addition to heat transfer performance, pressure drop penaltyis investigated in this study. Increasing nanoparticles in the water increasepressure drop penalty slightly, but using twisted tape in the smooth tubeincreases pressure drop penalty as about 6.5 times more.

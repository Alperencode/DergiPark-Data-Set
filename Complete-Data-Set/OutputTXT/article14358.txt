Qualitative research method was used in the study and the data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. The research pattern is case analysis, in other words, case study. In the research, in 2016, face-to-face interviews were conducted with the general manager of a food company affiliated to the group. According to the findings, Group X, which was in a weak situation in the ready-made food sector in 2008, took advantage of the weak features of its very strong rival and aimed to increase its market share by seeing the production gap in the market. While the food company affiliated to the group had a very small scale structure, it increased its technical and human capital in line with the strategies implemented, and increased its turnover by 420% in the first year and by 1200% in the second year. This is an issue worth examining as a successful growth story in terms of its realization process and results.

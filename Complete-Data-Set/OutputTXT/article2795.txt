Makale Başlığı: Comparative Quantum Chemical Analysis of Midaflur, a Fluorinated Aminoimidazoline
Özet: Inspired by the striking achievements of fluorine-containing heterocyclic compounds in pharmaceutical chemistry, in this study quantum chemical calculations were carried out on the midaflur compound, which has skeletal-muscle relaxant and central nervous system (CNS) depressant properties. First of all, the total energy (ΔETotal), enthalpy (ΔH), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) values for both tautomeric structures of midaflur were calculated and it was determined which form was more stable and the rest of the study was continued on this structure. For the stable amino form, the HF method and B3LYP/B3PW91 DFT functionals with different basis sets were used in order to examine the geometric parameters. The results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental values given in the literature. Furthermore, FT-IR analysis, Mulliken population analysis, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, and electrostatic surface properties were studied in detail. In another part of the study, the logPow (logarithm of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient) value, which is the numerical expression of the lipophilicity of a drug for entry into the CNS, was estimated for midaflur. For this purpose, the calculations were repeated for the water and n-octanol phases using the universal solvation model based on density (SMD) for all the methodologies used in this study, and the free energies of solvation were predicted. It was concluded that the predictive power of the computational methods increased in the order of HF < B3PW91 < B3LYP.

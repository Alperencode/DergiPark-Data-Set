Makale Başlığı: An Interactive Web Application for Kruskal Wallis H Test with R Shiny
Özet: Kruskal Wallis-H analysis of variance is a nonparametric method used to test the significance of the difference between three or more groups of medians in groups with no normal distribution. Kruskal Wallis H variance analysis, which is a nonparametric counterpart of the one-way analysis of variance, can be used in studies with at least 3 groups of ordinal data. The Kruskal Wallis H test is an extended form of the Mann-Whitney U method from two nonparametric group hypothesis tests. When the difference between the groups is determined after the Kruskal Wallis H variance analysis test, it is necessary to determine where this difference originates. It is very important to decide which of the multiple comparison methods and correction methods used to determine the difference. The purpose of this work is to develop a web-based application that uses the Kruskal Wallis H variance analysis test, which is used in the statistical analysis of studies consisting of three or more groups with nonparametric distribution, using the Shinny package in R software and shows an application of this software on simulation-derived data. The developed interactive web application can be accessed freely at http://biostatapps.inonu.edu.tr/kruskalwallis

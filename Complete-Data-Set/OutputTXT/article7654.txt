Makale Başlığı: Effects of Nutritional Habits on the Presence of Aflatoxin M1 in the Breast Milk
Özet: Investigating the Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1)presence in the breast milk of the nursing mothers in Erzurum province, depending on their nutritional habits. Study was conducted on the mothers (s=90) who have 0-12 months infants and reside in the province of Erzurum, in accordance with  ethical  considerations.  While  collecting  the  data,  a  questionnaire  was  conducted  to determine the period of breast feeding, Body Mass Index (BMI) and nutritional habits and the  presence  of AFM1was  determined  by  ELISA  method.  No  correlation  has  been  found between Body Mass Index and mothers’ nutritional habits with the AFM1concentration  in breast milk (p>0.05) and AFM1concentration varied between 0.0049 –0.01503 ppm (μg/kg) and determined as 0.006182±0.001748 ppm (μg/kg) on average. A negative correlation has been found with the AFM1concentration  in breast milk for mothers who frequently consume fresh  fruits  and  vegetables(r=-0.235)  (p<0.05).  While the  presence  of AFM1in breast milk does not pose a significant risk, mothers' frequent consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables during the breastfeeding period may increase  the breast milk quality which has fundamental importance on the infant's development and health.

Makale Başlığı: Adaptation of the Light Triad Scale to Turkish: A Validity and Reliability Study
Özet: This study aims to adapt the light triad scale of participants to Turkish. The research carried out for this purpose includes the validity and reliability process in the scale adaptation stage. In this context, an application was made to 139 participants who received postgraduate education in different branches in the field of physical education and sports sciences. The scale developed by Kaufman, Yaden, Hyde, and Tsukayama (2019) consists of 12 items. It consists of three sub-factors: belief in humanity, humanism, and Kantianism. The data collected with the language validity scale were processed into the SPSS-25 package program. Item-total correlation analysis was performed to test the internal validity of the items on the scale. In order to test the confirmation of the previously defined structure of the scale, confirmatory factor analysis was performed using the AMOS-25 package program. Cronbach Alpha and Gutmann coefficients were calculated in testing the reliability analysis of the scale. In the study, it was concluded that previously defined structure was confirmed and the items were distinctive, and their internal validity was ensured within the Turkish adaptation of the three-factor, 12-item light triad scale. It was determined that the reliability coefficients of the sub-factors and general of the scale are at an acceptable level. İt was concluded that the 3-factor, 12-item structure of the light triad scale, which was adapted into Turkish, was valid and reliable. The structure of the scale adapted within the scope of the research can be retested in larger samples and in each branch.

Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of the Failure of the Hegemonic Stability Theory in Terms of International Security  (Revelation of 725 Security Council Resolutions Belonging to Cold War Period)
Özet: This study aims to evaluate the success of the hegemonic stability theory within the framework of the Cold War era Security Council resolutions. In this direction, 725 resolutions of the Security Council between 1946 and 1991 have been examined and converted into numerical values in terms of content. It is seen that the decisions focused on a limited number of problems in the said period. The results show that the being of a single hegemonic power is not the main factor in providing stability. In addition, when looked at the post-Cold War period, it is possible to assert that the Security Council’s burden has increased. It is seen that the problems increase and diversify in the unipolar world, and international terrorism comes to the fore as the main actor. Hegemonic stability theory has not been successful in terms of international security. For international security, it is necessary to seek stability in a pluralistic structure, not in a single hegemonic power, because it does not seem possible to achieve success by ignoring national interests and the ethnicity and culture on which these national interests are built. Although the bipolar order offers a relatively stable security environment, the high threat perception prevents countries from revealing their potential for development.

Makale Başlığı: Capitalism Alone
Özet: Branko Milanovic is an economist who has focused on income distribution and inequality throughout his academic life. The first of his solo works on these themes is his 2010 work The Haves and Have Nots, which has not yet been translated into Turkish. Then, he published the book Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization, which was translated into Turkish in 2018, which was widely discussed in 2016. He continued this series with the book Capitalism, Alone, which was published in 2019 and translated into Turkish in 2021. In this article, in which we will analyze the work of Capitalism Alone, which arouses a lot of interest in the English-speaking world, we will try to emphasize the contradictions in the work while giving place to Milanovic's rightful findings.

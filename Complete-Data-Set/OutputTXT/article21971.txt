Makale Başlığı: NAVAL EXPEDITIONS OF CHIEF ADMIRAL KUCUK HUSEYIN PASHA (1792-1803)
Özet: In the Ottoman Empire, it was generally accepted that the title of chief admiral, the highest authority of the naval forces, should be given to people with naval experience. The reason for this was the thought that those who trained in the profession were more worthy of this position than those who came from outside. However, in practice, people who gained experience in different career steps were also conferred as capitan pasha and they provided successful services like the others. One of them was Küçük Hüseyin Pasha (1792-1803), who served as the chief admiral for nearly twelve years during the period of Selim III (1789-1807). Likewise Huseyin Pasha was promoted from başçukadarlık to capitan pasha with the title of vezaret and was considered the founder of modern Ottoman maritime with the reforms he made in the navy.Accordingly, this article's subject is the chief admiral period of Küçük Hüseyin Pasha, in particular the naval expeditions of the Pasha comprise the focus of the study. The purpose of this is to understand what kind of profile was displayed by Küçük Hüseyin Pasha during his naval expeditions. Therefore, the study consists of two parts. The first part contains the expedition of Hüseyin Pasha on the pirates in the Mediterranean, which was his first experience as capitan pasha. The second part covers the Egypt expedition in which the alliances were turned upside down. The choice of these two expeditions is due to the fact that Hüseyin Pasha's other naval expeditions showed routine navigation characteristics.

Makale Başlığı: Using Multimedia Learning Objects in Special Needs Classroom
Özet: The research project highlights the use and creation of multimedia learning objects to improve the learning of special needs students. The researcher investigated how the audiovisual context had progressed into a new approach to learning that sharpens the analytical reasoning and rational social skills of special needs students. This research proposed a two-group pre-test – post-test qualitative research to measure the impact of multimedia learning objects in improving the learning abilities of students with special needs in schools. The experiment aimed to see that a multimedia education paradigm may benefit two groups of students with different learning impairments. It was aimed toward students with Autism or Down Syndrome under the age of 15. Many of these students are taught in ordinary special needs classrooms without special intervention tools. The findings suggest that multimedia technology in learning can assist students with learning disabilities. The well-thought-out system benefited autistic students, demonstrating the educational potential of a multimedia system. A plan targeted to one particular disability group may be more effective than a comprehensive system that tries to fulfill the needs of many different disability groups.

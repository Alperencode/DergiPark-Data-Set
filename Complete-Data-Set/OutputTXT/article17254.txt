Makale Başlığı: The Spiritual Preparation Against Earthquake in The Framework of Prophetic Sources
Özet: The concept of “disaster and emergency management” gains a further meaning when placed beside the Prophetic warning: “There is no wisdom like precaution!”. Yet it is important to search for the answer of the question what could be the spiritual precaution in the context of “stance and glance of a believer” against fatal cataclysm like earthquake. The second part of the hadith: “Tie your camel and trust (in Allah)” i.e. “reliance” does not contradict with physical precaution, rather prepares people spiritually and inwardly in the face of the terrifying aspect of earthquake. In this research, through citations from the book Kashf al-Salsalah an Wasf al-Zalzalah written on seism, recording around 113 temblors occurred between (94-905 AH/713-1500 CE) giving reference to nearly 20 sources by al-Suyuti (d. 911/1505) one of the prominent muhaddiths and archivist scholars of Islamic history; some prophetic hadiths and words of companions/followers are transmitted, different acts of worship like prayer, fasting, charity, repentance, tasbih, takbir, salutation etc. that must be performed during and after the quake are mentioned.

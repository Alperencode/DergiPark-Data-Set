Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Friction and Wear Performances of Pure Poly-ether-ether-ketone Polymer and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Poly-ether-ether-ketone Polymer Composite for Bushing and Bearing Applications
Özet: Machine elements such as bushings, rollers and bearings made of plastic materials are used in some parts of the machines in different areas of the industry. Sometimes different loads affect these machine elements depending on the usage conditions and sometimes they work at different speeds. Depending on the affecting conditions, the working life of the material is determined. In this study, the tribological performances of pure poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) polymer and 30% by weight carbon fiber (CE) reinforced poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK-30CE) composite were investigated. Tribological experiments were carried out using pin-on-disk device at room temperature and dry sliding conditions. Two different loads, both 30N and 100N, and four different speeds (1, 2, 3 and 4 m/s) were used in the experiments. As a result of the experiments, the friction coefficient, pin temperature and specific wear rate of the pure PEEK polymer and 30% carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composite were determined. In addition, the microstructures of the wear surfaces were examined using an optical microscope. As a result of the experiments, depending on the sliding speed, the friction coefficient of both pure PEEK and carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composite decreased while the wear rate increased. It has been determined that the carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composite has an average of 50% higher wear resistance compared to the pure PEEK polymer.

Makale Başlığı: Our Endometrial Biopsy Results Received in Our Clinic in the Last 1 Year
Özet: To investigate and compare the relationship between indication and histopathological results in patients with endometrial sampling in our clinic. 143 cases with endometrial sampling who applied to our Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of Turhal State Hospital between December 2019 and December 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The data were obtained from the archives of our hospital's gynecology and obstetrics clinic and medical pathology clinic. SPSS 20 program was used for statistical analysis. The mean age of the patients was 48.96±11.84 and the mean hemoglobin (Hb) was 12.08±1.74 gr/ml. Endometrial sampling indications were menometrorrhagia 63 (44.1%), endometrial wall thickness increases 40 (28%), postmenopausal bleeding 23 (16.1%), tamoxifen uses 10 (7%), and control 7 (4.9%) patients. Endometrial biopsy results, on the other hand; endometrial polyp 52 (36.4%), chronic endometritis 34 (23.8%), secretory endometrium 30 (21%), endometrial hyperplasia 18 (12.6%), atrophic endometrium 6 (4.2%) and endometrium type adenocarcinoma 3 (2.1%) patients. When age and endometrial cancer were compared, it was found that the incidence of endometrial cancer increased as the age of the patient increased (p=0.001). In addition, while endometrial cancer was observed in the postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial wall thickness increase groups (1.4% and 0.7%), it was not seen in the other groups. While the most common indication for endometrial sampling was menometrorrhagia, the groups at risk for endometrial cancer were cases with postmenopausal bleeding and increased endometrial wall thickness. In addition, it was observed that the incidence of endometrial cancer increased as the patient's age increased. Therefore, severe endometrial evaluation and sampling is required in elderly patients with postmenopausal bleeding and increased endometrial wall thickness.

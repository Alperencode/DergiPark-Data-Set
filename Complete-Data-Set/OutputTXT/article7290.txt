Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT) WITH VERTEPORFIN IN EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (ARMD) AND UNDERSTAND ALL FEATURES OF VERTEPORFIN FOR OBJECTIVE ADVISING TO UKRAINIAN PATIENTS
Özet: In this study a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of PDT compared with current practice was undertaken. Searches in Macular degeneration Network, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Medline, Embase-Elsevier, the Cochrane Library and the Internet, updated to January 2007, revealed the Treatment of ARMD with Photodynamic Therapy (TAP) and the Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy (VIP) fully published, and other few ongoing randomized controlled trials. The overall incidence of study eye adverse events was not significantly different between verteporfin and placebo. Verteporfin-treated patients did not experience development of more subretinal hemorrhage, fibrosis, or atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium than did placebo-treated patients. No difference in VA between verteporfin-treated patients and controls was noted when the area of classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was more than 0% but less than 50% of the area of the entire lesion (termed minimally classic CNV lesions). However, minimally classic CNV lesions receiving verteporfin therapy were less likely to show progression of classic CNV beyond the area of the lesion at baseline, to have fluorescein leakage from classic CNV and to have a lesion size more than six disc areas compared to those receiving placebo. Verteporfin in combination with PDT should only be used by retinal specialists experienced in the management of ARMD and in diagnosis of classic CNV using fluorescein angiography (FA). Verteporfin in combination with photodynamic therapy may be used to treat patients with predominantly classic subfoveal CNV secondary to ARMD.

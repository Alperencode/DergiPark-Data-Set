Makale Başlığı: Main Factors in the Emergence of the One Belt One Road Project: the People's Republic of China Perspective
Özet: The One Belt One Road (OBOR) is a crucial project to direct world trade, and more than sixty-five countries have been involved in the initiative. BKBY is a huge transportation project that will affect a large part of the world's population. The "Silk Road Economic Belt", which is the landside of the project, constitutes an infrastructure network consisting of highways, railways, and oil pipelines stretching across the Eurasian continent. Maritime Silk Road project will greatly improve the transport link between East Asia and Europe and the Mediterranean, between South Asia and East Africa, and between the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. OBOR will affect not only land and sea transportation but also all sectors related to transportation. In this study, the internal and external motivation sources of China, which has the world's second-largest economy and is the executive of the project, will be examined. The study is aimed at those working in the transportation sector to learn about China's approach to the project and why it gives importance to this international project. Although studies related to this project were reached within the literature research carried out, a study that specifically addressed China's approach in internal and external context could not be reached. In the study, a comprehensive literature review was made and the main motivation sources for China's handling of the project were examined and explained in detail.

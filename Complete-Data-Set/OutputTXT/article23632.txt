Makale Başlığı: ROMA WOMEN IN THE CONTEXT OF GENDER
Özet: In this study, Roma women have been tried to be evaluated in the context of education, health, employment, poverty, social exclusion, and public sphere discussions in a gendered perspective. As it is known, Roma appears as the most disadvantaged group of societies in almost all parts of the world. In addition, Roma women are in double oppression because of both being Roman and being a woman. The negative living conditions of the Roma community are experienced much more deeply by Roma women. Roman women, who are trying to make themselves exist in a state of poverty and deprivation and trapped between cultural patterns, are in a more disadvantaged position compared to men. In addition to some Roma women who live in a spatially restricted state, the situation of other women who work in the informal sector and only thus achieve spatial mobility cannot cause a change and transformation in the lives of these women. This study aims to bring to the literature the double victimization of Romani women because of being both a woman and being a Romani from a gendered perspective. This study was created by scanning and analyzing the sources related to Roma, and it was seen that the place of Roma women in this literature is little/limited. For this reason, the literature was examined in-depth and the deficiencies related to the subject were tried to be revealed.

Makale Başlığı: Transformation From Place to Non-Place: The Case of Küpçüler
Özet: This study aims to reveal how the urban transformation process in the Küpçüler which is the district of Sakarya province was experienced by the Romani community living there. It looks into how Romanies that settled in Ahmet Yesevi Street in Küpçüler neighborhood experienced the alineation in terms of urban renewal and the mechanisms that lay behind. The study was conducted to evaluate the process of urban renewal through Marc Augé's conceptualization of “place” and “non-place” by focusing on the daily lives of Romanies. To do this, the study attempts to apply the approach of ethnography. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation were selected to gain deep insight. Moreover, archival research was carried out in Erenler Municipality which Küpçüler is administered, in order to utilize photographs as research data with respect to the history of the Street. Field notes related with the researcher's experience were also integrated into data analysis. It was found out that Romanies were strongly attached to the Street before the urban transformation and the way they developed the sense of belonging can be explained by the concept of “place”. On the other hand, after the renewal, they lack the sense of belonging due to the fact that the Street was transformed into a certain kind of waiting room as such a temporary space, an off-limits area, a “non-place”.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluating Transportation Network of University Campus by Using Space Syntax and GIS: Çankırı Karatekin University Uluyazı Campus Case Study
Özet: Universities are accessible living spaces where everyone is together. Nowadays, it has become important to design livable campuses because of university campuses are far from the city center.  Evaluating university open spaces, where daily activities are carried out and provide social interaction, will provide functional spatial organization in design. This study is aimed to reveal the relationship between physical accessibility and the land slope of Çankırı Karatekin University Uluyazı Campus transportation network, which is far from the city center.  The space syntax method was used to determine accessible spaces in the transportation system, and GIS were used to measure land slope. Firstly, integrated axes were analyzed with the space syntax method. Secondly, land slope groups were analyzed with GIS and classified according to their percentage. When all data were matched, it was found that axes with high integration value and low slope percentage overlapped on campus. The usability level and features of these areas with geographic spatial integration were examined and suggestions were made for improvement. The study results showed that the strengths and weaknesses of the university transportation network could be determined and campus designs can be improved through applied methodologies.

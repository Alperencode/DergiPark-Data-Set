Makale Başlığı: Protective Efficacy of Rosmarinic Acid on Acute Pancreatitis in Rats
Özet: AbstractAim: Acute pancreatitis is a serious disease, with an incidence of 5 - 35 in 100,000 individual. New studies are constantly planned for the treatment of pancreatitis. Many studies have shown that Rosmarinic acid has antioxidant properties. In this study, we examined the protective effect of Rosmarinic acid on acute pancreatitis.Material and Methods: A total of 28 animals were used during the experiment, and 4 groups were formed with 7 animals in each group. Group 1 is the control group.  The rats in Group 2 were administered 75 μg/kg Cerulein every hour intraperitoneally at one hour intervals, a total of four times.  Group 3 experimental animals were given 50 mg/kg Rosmarinic acid by per oral gavage. The rats in group 4 were given 50 mg/kg Rosmarinic acid per oral gavage after 75 μg/kg Cerulein was injected intraperitoneally every hour for a total of four times. Afterwards, all animals were sacrificed by exsanguination, blood samples and pancreatic tissue were taken for examination.Results: Examination of pancreatic tissues revealed necrosis, edema and inflammation in the acute pancreatitis group. Both histopathological and serum values of the rosmarinic acid group were close to the control group. The use of Rosmarinic acid after acute pancreatitis had a positive effect on the pacreatic tissues and blood values, but still did not cause complete recovery.Conclusion: In the case of acute pancreatitis, it was concluded that rosmarinic acid has a partial curative effect, but still does not provide a full recovery.

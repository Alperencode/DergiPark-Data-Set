Makale Başlığı: A Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Assessment Model for Feasibility Studies of Transportation Projects
Özet: Transportation investments are examined from many aspects, including technical, economic and financial, during the evaluation phase. Feasibility studies prepared for this purpose; It enables to identify the objectives of the investment, to see the problems that can be seen at all stages of the projects and the benefits to be gained in case the investment is realized. Evaluation of feasibility studies should be based on scientific principles above all. In this study, a three-stage model has been developed to evaluate feasibility studies. Criteria and alternatives were determined in stage 1. In stage 2, Best-Worst Method (BWM) for determining the level of significance of the criteria were used. In stage 3, a multi-criteria model created with fuzzy-based Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is proposed for the feasibility studies assessment. Current projects have been identified as alternatives to indicate the efficiency of the recommended process. After five projects were determined as alternatives, Alternative 2 was found as the best alternative. With the study, it was concluded that economy, technology and transportation are more effective criteria in the evaluation of feasibility studies.

For the reason of the writer had no other works at this type, this work of him falls behind. Besides, since the theatre is known as a stage of art, the works that were mad efor the theatre’s literary extent lacks of when compared with the other literary types. The examination of the factor of narrator in the works that the theatre is examined as literature has been ignored mostly since the last years.

By this way, we aim at contributing both to the studies about the author by leaning to Peyami Safa’s theater authorship aspect and to the works that theater is examined as a type of literature in the context of narrator factor and the narration techniques.

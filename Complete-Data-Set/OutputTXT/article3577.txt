Makale Başlığı: Qualitative and quantitative phytoconstituent determination, DPPH free radical lowering effect and In-vitro hypoglycemic activity study by alpha amylase enzyme assay along with membrane diffusion technique
Özet: Diabetes mellitus, a physiological disorder is characterized by low secretion of insulin due to the attack in insulin producing beta cell (Type I) or the body cell become insulin resistance (Type II). This study was designed to evaluate the DPPH lowering effect, in-vitro alpha amylase and glucose diffusion inhibition of the selected medicinal plants. Five different plant sample Amomum subulatum, Choerospondias axillaris, Musa sp, Myrica esculenta and Nephrolepis cordifolia were taken for the study. From the result it was revealed that the methanol extracts of Myrica esculenta stem bark and small branches showed potent DPPH free radical scavenging activity with the IC50 value of 4.23 µg/ml and 3.14 µg/ml respectively which is almost comparable to standard Ascorbic acid taken. Meanwhile, alpha-amylase inhibitory study showed that Myrica esculenta stem bark showed potent subsidiary effect on methanol extracts with IC50 value of 0.96 mg/ml which is comparable to standard volgibose taken. Lastly, membrane diffusion study with glucose and plant sample showed that Amomum subulatum seed and Choerospondias axillaris fruit have potent glucose diffusion inhibition with highest GDRI %. From the result, it could be correlated that the free radical scavenging activity and glucose lowering effect of these plant extracts is due to the presence of phytoconstituents like phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides saponins etc. as well as several other uncompetitive modes of inhibition.

Makale Başlığı: Urban Governance in Turkish Global Competitive Cities: A Study on Right to the City Perspective
Özet: Today, the city's values, representation, and reinforcing through the participatory process are turned into an eye by the principle of “governance”. The right to city one of the indicators is represented with the lens of it. On the other hand, the global city concept is strongly connected with fundamental shifts from traditional government structures to a modern governance mode. This study has focused on the theoretical context of urban governance, linkage with urban governance, right to the city and new urban policy, and its application according to the perspective of new urban politics. Application has been viewed from Turkish global competitive city perspectives by highlighting different indexes. The study found that Turkish cities should improve their public participation practices to strengthen their position for global competition. People-based policies should be strengthened and regulated to better fight in the arena of new urban politics; and bottom-up policies can play an effective role in ensuring right to the city.

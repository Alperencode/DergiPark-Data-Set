Makale Başlığı: Towards to Gastro(ethno)musicology- I
Özet: As it is known, food and beverage play a reinforcing and symbolic role in the daily and special rituals of each cul- ture within its own means. However, while foods are subjected to various applications until they reach the stage of being eaten, it is possible to say that music and dance accompany this process in the practices of the community/society. In addition to the indicators of the said unity reflected in the pages of history, it is possible to trace the ir traces in living traditions and to reach their contents and layers with the fieldwork and theoretical approaches, which are the research methodology of ethnomusicology. I will try to explain why I recommend the concept of gastroethnomusicology, which I propose as a combination of gastronomy and ethnomusicology, what it can include, and what the gastroethnomusicologist does if it is used, what the data it presents to social life can be, how it can make a difference, in a series of articles Towards to Gastro(ethno)musicology. At the same time, in my first article, which will begin by explaining a part of the long story about how I was directed towards such a proposition, I will try to find answers to the question of what are the discourses about the relationship between music (sound) and dance, along with a brief look at how the relationship between food and culture is handled in the field of social sciences.

Özet: Anatolia has not only been home to many civilizations, but also has so many different cultures. Thebelongings of our ancestors, who belong to the equestrian culture, found in the Pazirik kurgans in Siberia, aregion where Turks live, and the objects of skill, art and delicacy in every detail of these goods are consideredto be the oldest examples of this ancient richness. The unique features of the art of knitting have been determined according to the climate characteristics of each region, where the Turkish life is dominant, the feelings of the people, their lifestyles, the events and phenomena experienced in the region. Anatolia, which contains the richest examples of Turkish knitting culture, has rich knitting examples produced by the people. The art of hand knitting, which offers a wide range of subjects, styles and techniques from these knitting types, plays an important role in keeping the Turkish culture alive. Handicrafts, one of the most important elements of Turkish culture, are important in transmitting tradition, custom, and daily life culture to future generations and continuing to develop. Hand-knitted socks, which have an important place in the art of knitting, are the products that reflect the feelings, thoughts and skills of individuals who carry the culture, traditions and customs of the society, made by hand and with simple tools, especially using natural raw materials, based on the knowledge and skills of individuals. In this study, it has been determined that unique colors and motifs provide communication in order to meet the needs of individuals, to provide income and to continue the traditional structure in Anatolia, and it has been determined that hand-knitted socks have deteriorated in terms of materials and motifs and their usage characteristics have decreased. However, it is also important for future generations of the art of knitting that our socks, which constitute an important element of our culture, are introduced, kept alive, and directly identified and recorded in the living areas where they are knitted.

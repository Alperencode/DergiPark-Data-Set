Makale Başlığı: The Role of Adobe Materials in Housing Production for Internal Refugees in Northern Syria
Özet: Many people are in ınternally displaced people status in many parts of the world due to various reasons. The traditional adobe house architectural style has begun to be revived in northern Syria by many ınternally displaced people and those seeking shelter. Adobe material was reused in housing production, both through individual efforts and institutions and organizations. Various problems are experienced in the unplanned or planned camp areas that meet the shelter needs of ınternally displaced people to a great extent. The fact that the people at the design and implementation stage do not have sufficient knowledge about traditional adobe architecture, ignoring location, climate, and topographic features, and lack of public services and infrastructure have shown that the projects are not fully successful. The study, it is aimed to develop a house community model that meets the sheltering needs of internal refugees and produces solutions for the problems. In this context, the return to traditional adobe houses in northern Syria was handled and the continuity of the use of adobe materials was evaluated. It has great importance that the adobe house communities planned for ınternally displaced people are designed in line with the needs of the people who will live and that they are accessible and sustainable.

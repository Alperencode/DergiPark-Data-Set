Makale Başlığı: Usability of RPA in Electronic Records Management Systems
Özet: With the digitalizing business processes, new needs have emerged, and new concepts have been added to our lives. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) are two of the concepts that join our lives in this process. RPA which developed to meet the need for a digital workforce refers to a special software that simulates human interaction with information systems to perform business processes. ERMS are systems that enable institutions to carry out their records management processes over the electronic environment. In the study, it was aimed to determine the necessity of using RSO tools in ERMS, in which processes they can be used, the contribution of the using RSO tools to the processes and the institution. The descriptive and field (field) research methods were used. In order to create the conceptual framework and define the relevant terms, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, the usability of RSO in ERMS was discussed, and an application study was carried out on a selected ERMS in order to determine the situation on the subject. It is argued that the use of RSO tools in ERMS will contribute to the more effective management of ERMS by providing many benefits such as ensuring business continuity in the institution, enabling the personnel to be directed to value-added jobs, saving time and effort. At the end of the study, the difficulties that can be experienced during the implementation and the benefits to be obtained with the use of RSO in ERMS are revealed, ethical and legal obligations related to the subject are emphasized, evaluations and suggestions are presented.

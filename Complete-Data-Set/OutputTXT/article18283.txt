Makale Başlığı: PSYCHOSOCIAL RISKS IN THE GIG ECONOMY “A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS”
Özet: The gig economy concept is an economy that adopts a labor market consisting of freelance and short-term jobs as a mechanism that does not go to work and has no employer. Psychosocial risks/psychosocial hazards were defined by the International Labor Organization in 1984 as “interactions that have the potential to affect health, job performance, and job satisfaction through perceptions and experiences between the working environment, job content, organizational conditions, and employee capacities, needs, culture, and non-work issues” defined as. Psychosocial risks are one of the less-studied topics in the gig economy, but it is an issue that needs a comprehensive evaluation in terms of employee health and safety in the gig economy. This study was designed as qualitative research to analyze psychosocial risks in gig economy workers and consists of in-depth interviews with 20 people and a detailed analysis of these interviews.

Makale Başlığı: On the Method of Interpreting Scientific Knowledge
Özet: After defining objective scientific knowledge as information extracted from repeatable experiments or observations, which could not be refuted by another experiment or observation, responses given to specially selected topics: “water cycle” and “large scale structure of the universe” by Muslims were studied. The former one is a typical example of objective scientific knowledge reacted wrongly among Muslim societies. For the latter one, there could be positive and negative responses. The former one is related in starting; and latter one is linked with continuation of biological life on the Earth.  Such two subjects, one is popularly known and the other only astrophysicists know, were chosen intentionally in this study to emphasize how powerful the method of interpretation, which may work whether the subject is popular or not and valid for very different kinds of knowledge. The method of the study: after defining objective scientific knowledge, it has been attained that science is interested in only the questions starting “how?” but not “why?” according to a popularly known reference and various examples. After that, information coming from “why?” is defined as subjective knowledge and/or just the interpretation of the objective knowledge. Subjectivity of knowledge does not reduce its value; on the contrary, it opens a road for validating Islamic interpretations. How these two examples of objective scientific knowledge are interpreted according to Islam is shown by sample answers from Qur’an and Risale-I Nur.

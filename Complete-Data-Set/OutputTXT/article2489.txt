Makale Başlığı: An Apostille In Turkish Poetry: Recep Küpçü and a Thematic Analysis of His Poems
Özet: Recep Küpçü, one of the representatives of Turkish literature in Bulgaria, is a very important name, although he is not well known. The poet’s two books; Ötesi Var and Ötesi Düş Değil, were published four years apart. It is difficult to say that Küpçü’s poems are very voluminous, with a few poems not included in these books. However, the existing poems can be considered sufficient to extract the poet’s poetics. This study was carried out to analyse and classify the themes in his poems. As it is known, in a poem, theme and structure are related to each other. Theme coexists with the structure, and therefore thematic analyses are important. Moreover, it is even more important to make this analysis for the poems of an unknown and ignored poet like Mr. Küpçü. The aim of this study is to prove what kind of a meaning universe Mr. Küpçü has built in his poems and to expose the components of his art. In the research conducted, it was seen that the poet used both individual and social themes. While individual themes include notions such as love, nature, missing, hope, pessimism and friendship, social themes include concepts such as independence, regime oppression and sense of homeland. The poet adopts a very romantic style in his poems in which he prioritizes his artistic concerns. In these poems, he aggrandizes nature and love. However, he creates a very realistic social atmosphere in his social poems and writes the pressures of the dominant ideology, the censorship and the unfortunate luck of a whole people.

Makale Başlığı: Polyphenols in Traditional Sour Cherry Liqueurs - Beverages with Health Benefits
Özet: The polyphenoliccompounds of two traditionally obtained sour cherry liqueurs were evaluated.Liqueurs were prepared of ripe fruits, with addition of sucrose and food gradeethanol. The maceration process was performed with exposure on direct sunlight for the liqueur LA, and in dark at room temperaturefor the second one (LB), in period of 40 days. After aging of 6 months in darkfruits were separated from the liquid. The obtained liqueurs were analyzed onHPLC-DAD system, and the individual components were identified with LC-ESI-MSsystem. In both sour cherry liqueurs the presence of 36phenolic compounds was identified. However, the phenolic profiles of bothliqueurs differed significantly due to preparation conditions, and they werealso different from that of sour cherries used as raw material. It wasestimated that in the moment of analysis the total phenolics recovery was only15.72% for the liqueur prepared with exposure to sunlight during maceration,and 20.65% for the one where maceration was carried in dark.

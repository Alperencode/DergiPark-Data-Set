Makale Başlığı: The Power of Linear Methods in Determining the Dominant Fiscal Regime: A Research on Turkiye
Özet: The  Fiscal  Theory  of  the  Price  Level  suggests  that  in  a  non-Ricardian  regime,  an  inflation  targeting  monetary  policy  will  no  longer  be  able  to  control  the  price  level,  and  that  optimum  policy  should  always  include  a  combination  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  the  dominant  fiscal  policy  regime  in  Turkiye  using  the  ARDL  Bounds  Testing  Approach  and  to  compare  the  results  with  actual  observations.  The  review  period  covers  1996–2019  period  for  which the  quarterly  data  set  is  used.  Based  on  the  assumption  that  the  actual  behavior  of  the  government’s  fiscal  policy can be observed more accurately with the structural balance, the sub-components of primary balance (structural and cyclical balance) are also included in the analysis. During the review period, there were important breaks in the Turkish economy that could lead to changes in monetary and fiscal policies. To observe possible policy changes, rather than dividing the sample into different periods, dummy variables were used to reflect the  difference  between  periods.  The  results  of  the  analysis  show  that  the  structural  balance  more  accurately  reflects the actual behavior of the government’s fiscal policy. Another finding is that the linear ARDL approach is insufficient to capture the changes in the fiscal policy, especially in the periods when the fiscal space narrows.

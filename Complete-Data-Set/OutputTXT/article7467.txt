Makale Başlığı: Which Cold Application is More Effective for Tennis Elbow? Cooling Gel vs Cold Pack
Özet: Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate which cold application is more effective to regulate skin temperature in patients with tennis elbow. Design: Randomized clinical study. Participants: Fifty-four patients with tennis elbow were randomly divided into 2 groups as cooling gel group (n=27) and cold pack group (n=27). Interventions: Cooling gel and cold pack applications were applied on painful lateral epicondyle region for 15 minutes. Main outcome measures: Patients were assessed before and after the application. Assessments included the severity of pain during wrist extension, evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and thermal imaging of lateral epicondyle region evaluated by Infrared Thermography (FLIR5 Thermal Camera). Results: There were no significant differences between baseline assessments of pain severity and thermographic measurements in both groups (p>0.05). Significant differences were found between baseline and post-application measurements at pain and thermographic measurements in both groups (p<0.05). In comparison of cooling gel and cold pack groups, no significant differences were found in means of pain (p=0.095) and thermal imaging results (p=0.333). Conclusion: Both cooling gel and cold pack application are found effective in decreasing skin temperature in patients with tennis elbow and their use should be considered in treatment program.

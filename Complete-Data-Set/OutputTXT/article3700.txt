In the curriculum, the legal basis of the curricula are stated, and the general objectives determined for the students graduated from secondary school and other objectives specified under the title of "communication in mother tongue" in the " Qualifications Framework for Turkey" are explained. It has been expressed in the curriculum that the curriculum is prepared on the basis of the "thematic approach" in order to achieve the special objectives of the Turkish course. In this study, whether the texts in the "5th Grade Turkish Coursebook" published by the Ministry of National Education were conformed for the "theme" they belonged was investigated according to the views of the teachers. To achieve this, answers were sought for the questions of “What is the theme of the texts in the 5th grade Turkish coursebook according to the teachers? Is the text conformed with the theme in the coursebook?” The phenomenological design was used in the study. It was concluded as result of the study that three out of eight randomly selected texts from each theme in the relevant coursebook were not included under the correct theme in the coursebook, and five texts were under the accurate theme.

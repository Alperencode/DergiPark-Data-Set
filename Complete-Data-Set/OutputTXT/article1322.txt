Especially after the 2008 global financial crisis, environmental sensitivity has gained an international dimension. In a similar vein, the Ergene River Basin Environmental Management Master Plan and 1/100,000-scaled the Thrace Sub-Region Ergene Basin Environmental Plan came into force in 2009 upon the pollution in Tekirdağ, Turkey and its surrounding received governmental attention. 1/25,000 Scale Tekirdağ Provincial Environmental Plan and 1/5000 Scale Master Development Plans which were prepared and elaborated in consideration of the Thrace Sub-Region Ergene Basin Environmental Plan and 1/100000-scaled Thrace Sub-Region Ergene Basin Environmental Plan affect the nature and structure of the industry in Tekirdağ and the district-based development of Tekirdağ's districts.

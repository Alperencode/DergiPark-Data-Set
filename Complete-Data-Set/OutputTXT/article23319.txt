Makale Başlığı: A Study of Slovak University Students' Experiences of a Fast Food Brand in the Context of Perceived Value, Service Quality and Customer Trust and Loyalty
Özet: People's perceptions of products play an important role in the process of purchasing that product or service. Some of the most important of these perceptions are the quality of the product/service, perceived value and brand experience. Therefore, the consumer's experience with the product, the brand and the perceived value directly affect the perception of the product and therefore the consumer's trust and loyalty to that brand. In this study it is aimed to examine the brand experience, perceived value, service quality and customer trust and loyalty of university students in Slovakia about the products of a fast food restaurant. The survey method was chosen to collect data in this study. The sampling method was chosen as the implementation of the survey application in all main populations creates time and cost constraints. Reliability and correlation analysis of the scales in the questionnaire obtained in the study were performed and interpreted.

Makale Başlığı: The Soap Factory Building: An Example of Industrial Heritage in Ayvalık
Özet: This study concerns a soap factory built in the early years of the twentieth century in Ayvalık Soap factories which are described within the scope of immovable industrial assets of the region, are substantial in terms of the commercial life of Ayvalık, just like the olive oil factories. Soap factories having a crucial role in the industry-based spatial history of Ayvalık, are reviewed in two main groups according to their structure. The first group includes soap factories which were built as individual single buildings. The second group includes soap factories, each of which was built adjacent to an olive oil factory looking like its twin. Many of the soap factories are today either abandoned or being used as cafes, hotels, stores etc. as a result of repurposing. The soap factory forming the subject of this article is located in the 150 Evler District, on the historical industrial manufacturing axis of Ayvalık. Therefore the factory is in an area of Ayvalık which is considered to be hectic in terms of production and trading in its time. Respectively, field research, archival research and a literature review were performed in this study. As a result of the data obtained and finds the soap factory was evaluated in the context of historicity within the framework of architecture and art history disciplines and was analyzed in terms of mass and structure aspects

Makale Başlığı: Transformation of Science Museums into Science Centers as a Reflection of Active Learning in Museum Education on Architecture
Özet: In addition to preserving the important works they contain, museums have the function of informing their visitors about their collections through exhibitions. With these features, the differences in the conservation-oriented or educational-oriented approaches of the museums, which are cultural-educational environments, draw attention. In museums where protection is at the forefront, visitors are positioned as a passive observer as the works are kept as far away from the visitor as possible. The question of the research is how museums, which are the other group, prioritizing the educational mission, are affected by the studies on learning methods. For this reason, active learning, constructivist and experiential learning methods, which are a current approach, have been researched and the relationship between the museum setup and the visitor has been examined. Then, science museums with a dominant educational mission were selected to be examined with this perspective Science Museums have been examined in terms of exhibition methods and architectural constructs. In these museums, it has been observed that multi-sensory experience is given importance while providing the opportunity for active participation to the visitor. It has been understood that there is a strong bond between the visitor and the museum, both through these experiences and the new programs and functions added to the museums. In the architectural setups of such museums, the importance of the exhibition's ability to offer new experiences each time, its spatial flexibility, the potential for changeability, and the architectural technologies that support the experience have been understood.

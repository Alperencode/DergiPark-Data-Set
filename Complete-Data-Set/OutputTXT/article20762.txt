Makale Başlığı: Quality of Life in Patients with Shoulder Pain and the Effect of Physical Therapy on Quality of Life
Özet: Objective:  We aimed to investigate to what extent the quality of life of people is affected by shoulder pain originating from the shoulder joint and the contribution of physical therapy to the quality of life in our study.Methods: In our study, a total of 30 patients who applied to our outpatient clinic with the complaint of shoulder pain were evaluated. A physical therapy program consisting of 10 sessions of hot pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and ultrasound (US) was applied to the patients for 2 weeks. During the treatment, the patients were included in an exercise program and used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Evaluation was performed three times in total, before physical therapy, at the end of the treatment, and 3 months after the treatment. In controls, joint range of motion (ROM) was evaluated with the goniometer, pain was evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at rest, movement, and night, functional status was evaluated with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ), and quality of life was evaluated with Short Form-36 (SF 36).Results: A statistically significant improvement was detected in the physical function, physical role limitation and pain parameters of ROM, VAS, SPADI, SDQ and SF-36 at the end of the treatment and at the 3rd month controls compared to the pre-treatment. When the end of the treatment and the 3rd month values were compared, the improvement continued, albeit weaker.Conclusion: A significant improvement was observed in the VAS score, SF-36, SPADI, SDQ, ROM, and shoulder-specific tests in movement, rest and sleep in patients with shoulder pain at the end of the treatment and at the 3rd month controls. Physical therapy combined with exercise is considered as an efficient, cost-effective and safe method in patients with shoulder pain.

Makale Başlığı: Intercultural Language Teaching and Learning: Teachers’ Perspectives and Practices
Özet: Thanks to technological advances, migration, and globalization, English has become the language of internationalization. Therefore, many schools prioritized learning English to ensure and sustain international communication. However, in order to communicate well with individuals all around the world, bestowing English language learners with intercultural competence is also required in the teaching and learning of English. In Türkiye, one of the countries that host many immigrants, the experiences of foreign language teachers regarding intercultural issues might provide many insights into intercultural language learning and teaching. Therefore, this study aimed to expose EFL state schoolteachers’ perceptions and practices regarding intercultural language teaching and having foreign students in their classrooms. The methods that teachers adopted to promote intercultural competence in their classes were also explored. The semi-structured interviews were carried out with 30 English language teachers in middle and high schools in Türkiye. For data analysis, the computer program MAXQDA was benefited to categorize the codes and reveal the common themes. The findings revealed certain teacher practices that might contribute to students’ intercultural competence development and challenges experienced during that process. It can be concluded that teachers are in need of professional guidance and resources to further develop their learners’ intercultural competence.

Makale Başlığı: Identity in Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation: Sectarian Identities in Post-Conflict Syria
Özet: Syria is one of the significant examples in the literature of conflict studies. Although there are many reasons for the events in Syria, sectarian identities, material gains related to these identities and a cycle of violence may remain. When the violence in Syria ends or turns into a different form, the emphasis on identity and sectarian identities will continue to find a place in political and social life in the post-conflict processes as well as before and during the conflict. For this reason, it is necessary to consider identities and identity transformations in processes such as post-conflict resolution and reconciliation, and to prevent identities from becoming an element of conflict by instrumentalizing them. This is necessary for genuine peace to come in the country and to avoid a cycle of violence. One of the most critical issues in conflict resolution and reconciliation literature is the necessity of realizing identity transformations together with concrete solutions. If these processes are not carried out in appropriate ways, it is common that cycle of violence recurs in certain periods. In this study, sectarian identities in Syria, the place of identity in post-conflict resolution and reconciliation processes, identity transformations and possible social reconciliation approaches in Syria will be discussed.

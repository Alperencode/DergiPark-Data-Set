Makale Başlığı: SEROPREVALENCE OF HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HCV, and Anti-HIV IN PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN AN AMATEM CLINIC IN EASTERN TURKIYE: A SIX-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION
Özet: AimSubstance abuse and concomitant infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. Yet, the number of epidemiological studies regarding infectious diseases in people with substance abuse are limited in our country. In this study, the aim was to investigate the frequency of illegal alcohol and substance use in an Alcohol and Drug Research, Treatment and Training Centres (AMATEM) clinic in Turkey as well as the HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV parameters between the years of 2016-2021. Material and MethodHBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV tests were conducted using the ELISA technique in 6881 alcohol and substance use disorder (ASUD). Urine samples from ASUD’s were analyzed for alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine metabolites. The results were evaluated retrospectively. ResultsAll of the 6881 ASUD’s were male with a mean age of 32.18±9.66 years. Of the 6881 ASUD’s included in the study, 4107 (59.7%) were opioid addicts; 1479 (21.5%) were mixed drug addicts; 897 (13%) were alcohol addicts; and the rest were addicts with other types of substance use. The mean age of the alcohol users was 45.33±13.03 and the mean age of opioid users was 29.90±7.13. The percentage of opioid addiction in 2016 was 71.2% which dropped to 28.7% in 2021. Meanwhile, the percentage of alcohol addiction was 13.6% in 2016 and increased to 21.4% in 2021; and the percentage of mixed drug use was 8.7% in 2016 and increased to 36.8% in 2021. HBsAg-positivity in opioid users (56.7%) was higher compared to cannabis users (2.6%) and mixed drug users (22.3%). Anti-HCV positivity of opioid users (69.4%) was found to be higher compared to alcohol (9.4%), cannabis (2%), and mixed drug (16.2%) users, and this finding was statistically significant (p=0.0001). Anti-HBs positivity of opioid users (63.1%) was found to be higher compared to alcohol (9.9%), cannabis (3%), and mixed drug (21%) users, and this finding was statistically significant (p=0.0001). Anti-HIV was determined negative in all ASUD’s. The highest rates of HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HBs positivity were found in the 26-30 years of age. ConclusionThese findings indicate a high prevalence of intravenous substance abuse in the 26-30 years age group in our region as well as the high HBV and HCV rates in this patient group.

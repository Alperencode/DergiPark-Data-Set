Makale Başlığı: Fuzzy Logic Based Decision Support Systems Designed for Estimating Spread of Bioterrorist War Agents
Özet: According to agreements signed between countries, the production, development, and storage of bioterrorist warfare materials are restricted. However, due to the advantages of bioterrorist warfare agents, they are likely to be used by terrorist groups against countries. In the face of this risk, countries need to have certain precautions and plans. These plans include bioterrorist warfare agents and early detection of the diseases they cause. In this study, a fuzzy logic-based decision support system was designed for the diagnosis and prediction of the spread of biological warfare agents. In the designed system, disease-specific symptoms were selected and used as input variables in the system. The risk of being infected by symptoms was obtained to be %. Mamdani and Sugeno fuzzy inference systems were used in the study. Different membership functions and defuzzification methods have been used to obtain results. When the data of 500 randomly generated patients was processed according to different models, infection risk estimation outputs ranging from 0% to 100% were obtained.As a result, it was concluded that successful outputs were obtained when the designed fuzzy decision support system was used in the field of bioterrorism and that fuzzy logic-based decision support systems can be used in the fields of bioterrorism and health.

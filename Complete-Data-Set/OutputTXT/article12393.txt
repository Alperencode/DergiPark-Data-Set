Makale Başlığı: A GAME THEORY SIMULATION ON THE CREDIT SYSTEM OF BANKS
Özet: Game theory is defined as a mathematical approach that argues that the earnings of an individual or group in a competitive environment depend on the decisions of other individuals and groups participating in this competitive environment. When evaluated from this point of view, game theory emerges as a strategic decision-making tool, which is also expressed as the mathematics of competition. With the increasing competition in today's conditions, game theory, also known as game theory, has started to come to the fore. Especially with the emergence of asymmetric information in the markets recently, the importance of game theory has been understood even more. When evaluated from this point of view, game theory, especially in the banking sector, where asymmetric information is widespread, has started to have a great importance in lending and giving, since banks do not have full information about the investment of the customer receiving the loan and the future of this investment. In this direction, in this study, general strategic approaches towards loans given by banks have been developed and examined within the framework of game theory. As a result, it has been understood that the most correct strategy is to apply credit to both parties and to repay the loans they have received.

Makale Başlığı: EFFECTIVENESS OF INTRAPLEURAL FIBRINOLYTIC THERAPY
Özet: Objectives: Fluids filling the complicated pleural space may disrupt the normal function of the lung and require medical  or surgical intervention. Streptokinase or Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) acts by breaking down fibrin and some other proteins, and with intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) performed at the appropriate time, this process can be interrupted, the development of fibrous crust on the lung can be prevented, and the patient can be saved from undergoing more invasive procedures. Method: In this study, 280 cases who underwent IPFT with tube/catheter thoracostomy between 2003 and 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. Fibrinolytic agent dissolved in 100 cc saline was administered through the intrapleural space via tube or catheter thoracostomy. Thoracostomy tube or catheter was clamped for 1-4 hours to ensure optimum effect. Then, the clamp was opened, and the patient was followed up with close drainage. As an IPFT agent in 100 cc of saline solution, 250000 IU of streptokinase or daily doses of 5-10mg Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) was applied. Results: A total of 280 patients (195 (69.6%) male and 85 (30.6%) female) with a mean age of 51.5 (5-86) years underwent IPFT. Streptokinase was applied through the pleural space to 85 (30.3%) and Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) to 195 (69.7%) cases. After this treatment, complete response was obtained in 252 and partial response in 11 patients. As complications, intrapleural bleeding was observed in 12 and aseptic pouch in 13 cases. The success of the treatment was determined as 90 percent. Conclusion: Instead of more invasive surgical procedures in the treatment of non-draining complicated pleural effusion, IPFT is a safe, effective, and highly successful procedure with a lower side effect profile.

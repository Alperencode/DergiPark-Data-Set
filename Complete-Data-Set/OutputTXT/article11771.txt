Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of the Surrealist Art Movement's Contribution to Fictional Spaces and the Concept of the Metaverse in the Context of the Norm
Özet: Surrealism is an art movement interpreted by Surrealist artists with the advent of consciousness studies in the 19th century. Sigmund Freud's research on consciousness in the 19th century inspired surreal artists. Surreal works of artists such as Rene Magritte, Salvador Dali, Giorgio de Chirico can be considered as the first steps of future Metaverse spaces. In the 19th century, the search for the perfect form of the modern age shaped spaces as well as the human body. The pioneers of the surrealistic movement inverted established perceptions by addressing the canonical body and spaces in their works. With the development of 3D technology and metaverse, the design of non-normative spaces and bodies has become more possible. The study evaluated the effect of thoughts created by virtual reality along with surreal movement on fictional spaces and bodies within the norm. As a result of the study, it is predicted that unusual fiction will be more common in virtual reality and the perception of norms will change. It is assumed that in the mystical universe of virtual reality, spaces and bodies without organs will emerge and trigger social, sexual, and cultural revolutions.

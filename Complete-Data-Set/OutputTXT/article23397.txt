Makale Başlığı: Pesticide Applications with Agricultural Unmanned Air Vehicles
Özet: In order to increase the productivity in plant production, the development of the plants under the most suitable conditions should be ensured. The struggle against diseases, pests and weeds has an important place in providing suitable conditions. For the effective application of chemical control, which is one of the most common plant protection methods, the dose, amount and application time of the right chemical, as well as the application tools and the opportunities provided by these tools, also affect the result. Inappropriately selected tools and machines can cause product loss as well as environmental damage.In the agricultural sector, where a significant development has been achieved over time with the advancing technologies, smart agriculture applications have gained speed in the "Agriculture 4.0" (Digital Agriculture) period. Among these applications, the "Agricultural Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (agricultural UAVs)" (Drones) stands out. Among the purposes of use of agricultural UAVs, it is possible to mention many applications such as disease and pest detection, water stress detection, irrigation and pesticide applications, weed detection in the field, fertilizer and seed scattering applications, the topography of the land, yield and quality calculations.In this study, usage of agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles and the positive and negative aspects of their pesticide applications were investigated.

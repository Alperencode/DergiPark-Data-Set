Makale Başlığı: محاكمات 15 تموز في عامها الرابع
Özet: This article discusses the fourth year of July 15 coup’s trials and the role of the Turkish judicial institution, that acted quickly and issued arrest warrants against the coup plotters from the first hours of the coup out of awareness of the danger of Gülen’s terrorist group’s penetration within the state’s institutions. The coup related trials are still, justly and effectively, taking place and are close to an end. These trials, which include tens of thousands of people following a coup attempt that has shaken the basic state institutions, are a burden. However, carrying them out effectively and fairly in a period of external and internal threats should be recorded as a success for the Turkish judiciary

Makale Başlığı: Beekeeping problems and solution suggestions in forest villages (Trabzon Regional Directorate of Forestry example)
Özet: In this study, the beekeeping and bee products production process in 523 enterprises supported or not supported with ORKOY loans in forest villages in Trabzon, Rize, Gümüşhane, and Bayburt provinces under the Trabzon Regional Directorate of Forestry were examined. The problems they encountered were determined by the face-to-face survey method. Beekeepers’ gender, age, education, residence, livelihoods, social security status, monthly and annual incomes as well as fixed and mobile status were examined. During the production process, equipment deficiencies, queen bee problems, bee diseases, wintering losses, bee accommodation problems, damage from wild animals and pesticides, marketing problems and training demands were determined and solutions were proposed for the problems of beekeepers. In addition, with the data obtained, ORKOY scientific beekeeping loans can be regulated.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Pneumatic Conveying Characteristics of Canola Seeds
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the pneumatic conveying characteristics of canola seeds (Brasicca napus Oleifera sp). The physical properties, pressure drop, air velocity, power consumption characteristics of Turan variety canola seeds were investigated. Three different canola moisture (6.36%, 16.54% and 25.94%), three different pipe diameters (43.1, 54.5 and 70.3 mm), three different material feed flow rates (3.89, 5.47 and 7.49 t/h) and five different air velocities (5 compressor cycles of 850, 1150, 1450, 1750 and 2250 min-1) were used and the effects of these factors on the pneumatic conveying characteristics of the canola seeds were examined. The pneumatic conveying of canola seeds was carried out at the positive pressure pneumatic conveyor. The pressure drop and power consumption have increased with the increase of air velocity. The lowest pressure drop and power consumption values were obtained in conveying with pipe diameter of 70.3 mm, canola seed moisture of 16.54%, compressor speed of 1150 rpm and conveying capacity of 3.89 t/h. The lowest power consumption was achieved with the conveying of the canola seed at 6.36% moisture, 7.49 t/h material feed flow rate and 1150 rpm compressor speed. In trials, the pressure drop decreased when the pipe diameter was increased.

Makale Başlığı: Conscience Summoning Heidegger’s Philosophy
Özet: In our study, we tried to explain how conscience, which Heidegger treats ontologically, is a field of possibility for Dasein. Heidegger, differing from the thinkers before him, tried to deal with it with an ontological perspective instead of an ethical-based analysis of conscience. According to him, Dasein, thrown into the world in thrownness, closes its authentic possibilities while taking shelter in everyone-self due to the anxiety and uncertainty it feels. Conscience is the only key to Dasein's return to the possibilities of being closed. By summoning Dasein into its all-self, conscience invites Dasein forward to its guilt/indebtedness. The call made comes from the uncanny of Dasein, fed by authentic silence, and is about itself. Guilt/indebtedness should be understood as the lack and incompleteness of Dasein. Dasein, who listens to the call, gives a chance to its own choices to open the possibilities of being that it has closed by taking shelter in the self-everyone. When conscience calls Dasein forward, it invites it into the phenomenon of the situation, enabling it to prioritize the possibilities that are possible. Thanks to Dasein's closure-opening-determination, everyone can return to their own possibilities by revealing the modes of being that they have closed. In our study, we examined four objections to Heidegger's thought of conscience, which he saw as feasible from the perspective of ontic conscience.

Makale Başlığı: THE LIFE OF GERMAN FRANZ FREDERİK SCHMİDT-DUMONT’S AND HİS ACTIVITIES IN TURKEY (1882-1952)
Özet: The study was mainly carried out by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs archives by taking advantage of Franz Frederik Schmidt-Dumont’s -who is the topic of this article- family archive. In the First World War’s eve, Schmidt-Dumont came to Turkey first-time in the years 1913-18 and was involved in the activities. Through German Ambassador Rudolf Nadolny who assigned in Turkey after the First World War, Dumont worked as chief editor for Türkische Post propagandistic newspaper of his country in Turkey and also represented German official news agency Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro in Turkey. Through Franz von Papen which will be the Ankara ambassador of Germany and with the approval of the Joseph Goebbels who was the minister of propaganda, Schmidt-Dumont has been a media attaché in German embassy. He has been also an important factor in German propaganda in Turkey and the Middle East. The Germans claim that his duties were about just for media and culture; however, he often tried to collect some important news and intelligence information about politics.

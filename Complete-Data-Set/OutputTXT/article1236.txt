Makale Başlığı: The effect of legal knowledge on professional life of forest engineering
Özet: As in any other professional discipline, forest engineering vocational education along with technical and applied sciences, social sciences and theoretical knowledge are also needed. One of the courses in which this knowledge is gained is the law courses. Law courses in the engineering discipline can be difficult and boring to understand at first. Even, lack of information can cause some judicial or administrative problems. For this reason, in this study, the effects of both the law courses in forest engineering education and their contents on professional life were tried to be determined by conducting a survey with forest engineers working in state forest enterprises. Zonguldak Regional Directorate of Forestry was chosen as the study area. With the study, which legal knowledge the forest engineers working in public institutions need while performing their profession; where this information is needed in working life; the problems experienced in the absence of the legal knowledge were evaluated via the forest engineers participating the survey, and some suggestions were made to avoid these problems. A comment made within the questionnaire returns summarizes the purpose of the study; “No matter how good you are in engineering, practice and administration, that does not relieve you of legal liability”.

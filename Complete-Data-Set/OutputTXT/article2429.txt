Makale Başlığı: Analysis of global COVID-19 vaccine policies with public value mapping approach
Özet: The public value theory argues that a social benefit should occur as a result of the policies, actions and operations of public administrations. However, the production of social benefit is possible by bringing together various and different actors, factors and interests in a certain harmony. For this reason, it is important to determine whether a value is formed as a result of all policies, actions and operations of public administrations. The “public value failure model” and the “public value mapping approach” included in the model were also created for this purpose. As a policy analysis method, the public value mapping approach allows to determine whether public value is formed within the framework of certain criteria. The biggest problem of the global community in the current period is the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and international organizations are implementing various policies to combat the COVID-19 and its negative consequences. Vaccine studies are the most important part of these policies. In this study, global vaccine policies were tried to be analysed using the public value mapping approach. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that there is injustice and inequality on a global scale in terms of access to and vaccination, and therefore, public value cannot be created in the current situation.

Makale Başlığı: Recycling of Al6061 Chip by Powder Metallurgy
Özet: In recent years the development of industry has played a significant role in the increase of environmental pollution. In order to protect the environment, the recycling of metallic wastes is getting more and more attention day by day. For this reason, solid-state methods, which provide the recycling of aluminum waste, especially in the form of chips with low energy and minimum emission, have started to be preferred. In this study, solid-state recycling was aimed by sintering Al6061 chips in a vacuum environment under 10-4 mbar, 30 MPa pressure and at different temperatures (560, 580 and 600C) for 15 minutes by powder metallurgy. In order to examine the effect of sintering temperature on material properties, the densities of the produced samples were measured according to the Archimedes principle, and they were subjected to wear, hardness and bending tests. When the test results were evaluated, the highest density was obtained in the sintered sample at 600°C with a relative density of 97,8%. The increase in density values also directly affected mechanical properties. The highest hardness value was measured in the sample sintered at 600°C with 58.9 HV. Wear performance increased with increasing hardness ratio. As a result of the bending test, the highest bending strength was measured at 348 MPa in the sample sintered at 600°C. Consequently, solid-state recovery of Al6061 chips was achieved by the hot press method, and it was demonstrated that it is possible to produce high-strength parts as well as material shaping.

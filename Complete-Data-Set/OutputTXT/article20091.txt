In the study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between the reasons of hedonic consumption and the demographic characteristics of consumers on Black Friday in Turkey within the scope of consumer buying behavior. In the research part of the study, the survey consisting of two parts was applied using the convenience sampling method. The questionnaire was shared with consumers over the internet and 458 internet users responded to the survey. t-test, frequency test, reliability analysis and ANOVA tests were used in the analysis of the research data. According to the analysis findings, 93% of the people who participated in the research had heard of the concept of Black Friday before and 50% benefited from the discounts on Efsane Günler. As a result of the statistical analysis, it was determined that hedonic consumption for "adventure", "role acquisition", "gaining ideas" and "relaxation" differs according to gender, and hedonic consumption for the purpose of “relaxation”  differs according to marital status. In addition, although there are differences according to age groups and education levels, there was no effect of income status on hedonic consumption.

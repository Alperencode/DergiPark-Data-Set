Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Quality and Reliability of YouTube Videos on Dry Needling Procedure
Özet: Objectives: With the popularization of the Internet, social media platforms are used frequently as an information source. Patients can watch YouTube videos and gather information on dry needling especially before the procedure. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the reliability and quality of videos on dry needling. Materials and Methods: A search was conducted on YouTube using the keyword “dry needling”. Features of videos, such as the number of views and duration of the videos, were noted. The reliability and quality of videos were assessed with the DISCERN and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Results: A total of 150 videos were screened and 50 videos were excluded: 30 were duplicates, 10 were off-topic, 5 were in a language other than English, and 5 had no audio. Most of the videos were uploaded by non-physician health personnel (42%) and physicians (27%). The most common video content was demonstration (53%) of dry needling. The mean scores of the JAMA and DISCERN tools were 1.9 and 35.3, respectively. Thirty-four percent of videos were very poor, 31% were poor, 18% were fair, 11% were good, and only 6% were excellent. Conclusion: YouTube is a platform where medical information is freely shared and widespread. In this study, we found that most of the YouTube videos on dry needling were of low quality. Future efforts by healthcare professionals and academic institutions are necessary to improve the reliability and quality of medical information on dry needling.

Makale Başlığı: The Image of Izmir in Recent Turkish Cinema
Özet: Cinema and urbanization have progressed together in the historical process; the development, change and transformation of major world cities can be watched through films. Visual memory of urban space was kept in films and urban images shaping social memory were recorded in the films. Nevertheless, cinematographic representations contributed to the creation and consolidation of urban image and identity. When we look at the city in Turkish cinema, it is seen that Istanbul has been leading the films since the history of cinema. However, although Istanbul is at the forefront as the center, other cities and non-urban spaces have also been visible in movies from time to time. Izmir, which is among the top five major cities in Turkey, has frequently entered the frame of the film industry since the Yesilçam period. Izmir has been visible in many popular and well-known films during the period of high national film production; especially in the last decade, the city has been involved in films with exceeding in numbers and different images than in the past. Although Izmir has appeared in cinema with superficial, touristic and clichéd city images in various past films, this approach has changed over time; It is assumed that Izmir has created a space for more alternative and realistic narratives in recent Turkish cinema. From here, the question of how Izmir city is represented in recent Turkish cinema, whether there is a change in urban images, urban spaces and narratives about the city from the past to the present is discussed in this study.

Makale Başlığı: EMPLOYEE WELL-BEİNG SCALE: A STUDY OF ADAPTATİON TO TURKISH CULTURE
Özet: The aim of this study is to adapt the Employee Well-Being Scale developed by Pradhan and Hati (2019) to Turkish culture and to investigate its psychometric properties. There are two different sample groups in the study; The first sample group consisted of 608 healthcare professionals and these data were used in exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The second sample group consists of 298 health workers and the collected data was used in the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) technique. In this context, the total sample of the research is 906 health workers. For the language equivalence of the scale, opinions were received from 18 experts with at least undergraduate education in English. After the translation of the original scale into Turkish, the data collection process was started. SPSS 22 and SPSS AMOS programs were used in the analysis of the obtained data. For the construct validity of the scale, first of all, EFA was performed and the scale structure was factored as 25 items and 4 dimensions. This structure was subjected to first and second level CFA techniques to obtain proof of construct validity. The reliability of the scale was analyzed with the Cronbach Alpha coefficient over internal consistency. According to the findings obtained from the validity and reliability studies; The Turkish version of the Employee Well-Being Scale is a scale that can be used in related studies, providing adequate psychometric properties and a high degree of validity and reliability.

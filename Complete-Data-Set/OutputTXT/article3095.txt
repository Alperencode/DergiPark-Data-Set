Makale Başlığı: Flower Type Affects the Timing of Embryo Development in Native Primula Vulgaris
Özet: In this study, pin and thrum flowered wild primrose (Primula vulgaris= Syn: Primula acaulis) populations, which are naturally distributed in Black Sea Region in Türkiye, were cultivated and their pollen viability, pollen tube growth and embryo development stages were investigated. As a result of the study, pollen viability in pollen of the pin flower type was 83.10%, while the in vitro germination rate was 69.43%. The viability and in vitro germination rates of pollen of thrum flower type were 84.91% and 67.92%, respectively. As a result of the squash preparation examinations, it was observed that the pollen tubes of both types started to germinate on the stigma on the 1 DAP (Day after pollination). On 4 DAP, it was determined that pollen tubes penetrated to the ovule. Embryo developmental stages examinations showed that, zygote formation occurred on 6 DAP in the pin flower type; while on the 20 DAP, the embryo was in the heart stage and finally on the 40 DAP, it was seen that it formed a mature cotyledonary stage embryo. Endosperm in the thrum type started to develop faster than the pin type and formed on the 6 and 7 DAP. In the thrum flower type, the proembryo formed on 10 DAP, but embryo formation could only be seen on 30 DAP. In the ovary examinations performed on the 40 DAP, some embryos were in the cotyledon stage while some were still in the globular or heart stage. It was also determined that no embryos were found in some ovules.

Makale Başlığı: Health Policy Analysis: Concept, Methods And Techniques
Özet: Health policy can be defined as the decisions, plans and actions taken to achieve certain health goals in a society. The analysis of health policies has an important place both for the development and results of the policies in practice and for revealing the policies for the future. Health policy analysis is in a position to contribute to the health of individuals and society more than ever before. Approaches to policy analysis largely depend on the disciplinary framework used and the purpose of the analysis. Of course, the economic analysis of the particular policy and the analysis of the potential impact on society require a different approach. The aim of this study is to explain the concepts of health policy, health policy analysis and to reveal the methods and techniques of health policy analysis. For this purpose, the document analysis method was used. In the study, health policy analysis, which is quite underdeveloped in the Turkish literature, is handled from all aspects, health policy analysis methods and techniques are presented, and case studies on the subject are presented in a holistic way. Health policy analyzes in the academic field have an important place, and it is thought that this study will fill an important gap in terms of being a guide for researchers since it presents the methods and techniques of health policy analysis in a holistic way.

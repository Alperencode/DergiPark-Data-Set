Makale Başlığı: ON THE STORY OF FATİH KERIMI’S “TILSIZ HATUN”
Özet: In the first quarter of the 18th and 20th centuries, some innovation movements in different geographies had wide repercussions in the field of Idil Ural, and the new searches that emerged especially on the ground of modernization of education gave the opportunity to question the classical education institutions that have been going on for many years. The first objections to the old teaching method in Bukhara madrasahs, where a traditional understanding has prevailed for centuries, will be voiced by great scholars such as Şehabeddin Mercani. This ancient understanding, which had no contribution to the society in the years following Mercani, will be criticized loudly and it will be revealed that the modern understanding should be dominant in education. The group of intellectuals who call themselves “jadidists” will express that it will not be possible for the society to move forward with these old madrasahs, and they will say that literacy should increase and girls should benefit from education and training activities on an equal basis with boys. Fatih Kerimi, who took part in this movement, will focus on the problematic areas in the society in hisworks and newspaper and magazine activities and offer solutions to them. Kerimi, who worries about the problems of the society and constantly thinks about the problems of the people and adopts the principle of finding solutions to the problems, has been busy with continuous education and broadcasting activities for the development of the Tatar nation to which he belongs. In this respect, in his works and publishing activities, he made an effort to identify the problematic areas in the society and find solutions to these areas, just like a sociologist. This study will focus on Fatih Kerimi’s work called “Tilsiz Hatun”, which was published in Orenburg in 1908. The work in question draws attention by separating it from other works of the author in terms of beingwritten in an individual style and containing humorous elements, unlike the intellectual articles that Kerimi wrote in the newspapers and the social issues he dwells on in his stories.

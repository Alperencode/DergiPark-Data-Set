Makale Başlığı: The Issue of Imitation and Example of Jesus Christ in the New Testament and in the Church Fathers before and after Nicaea
Özet: The most important figure of Christianity from the past to the present is undoubtedly Jesus Christ. Because, in the eyes of Christians, he has a personality that should be “imitated or taken as an example” with his divine and human aspects. Jesus did not talk about imitating himself, but Paul, the architect of today's Christianity, was the first to talk about the imitation of Jesus Christ, saying, “Imitate me, as I imitated Christ.” He formed the understanding of imitatio Christi by being influenced by many religions and cultures such as the Old Testament, Judaism, Hellenism and Gnosticism in which he grew up. Paul’s discourses on this subject have been discussed and continue to be discussed by the Church Fathers and later Christians by being associated with his understanding of “incarnation” and “salvation”. There is no study in our country on this subject, which has been written and discussed in the Christian world for hundreds of years. Therefore, the understanding of imitation of Christ; The origin, conceptual framework, New Testament and Church Fathers will be discussed and the importance of the subject in the Christian world will be tried to be revealed.

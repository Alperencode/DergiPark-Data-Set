Makale Başlığı: Prediction of Mathematics Achievement: The Role of Mathematical Metacognition and Problem Posing Self-Efficacy
Özet: Metacognition is the ability of students to have knowledge about their own thinking processes and cognition and to organize this structure. Since metacognition is a method of discovering or choosing a specific mental process in the problem solving process, it has important effects on mathematical problem posing and achievement. In the study, mathematical metacognition awareness and mathematical problems posing self-efficacy of students were determined, and the relationship between them and their mathematics achievement was examined. The research, which was designed in the correlational survey model, was carried out with 462 secondary school students. The data of the study were gathered through the "Problem Posing Self-Efficacy Scale" and the "Mathematical Metacognition Awareness Scale". Pearson Product Moments Correlation Coefficient and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis were used to analyze the data. As a result of the research, a moderately significant relationship was found between students' mathematical metacognitive awareness and their mathematical problem posing self-efficacy and mathematics achievement. In addition, it was determined that mathematical metacognitive awareness and problem posing self-efficacy of students predicted their achievement at the level of 35%. The results of this study point to the need to explore the importance of metacognition and problem posing as an important factor on students' achievement.

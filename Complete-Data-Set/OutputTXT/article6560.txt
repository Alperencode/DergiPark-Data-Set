It was found that pulling to the side was applied and the mean pain level was 2.17±0.71.As a result of the study, it was determined that the level of pain in children was low in the postoperative period and that nurses commonly applied nursing interventions through non-pharmacological methods in pain management, taking into account the age characteristics of the child.

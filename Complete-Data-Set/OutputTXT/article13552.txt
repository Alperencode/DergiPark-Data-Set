Makale Başlığı: Cancer and Social Isolation in the Shadow of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Özet: The new type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which emerged at the end of 2019 and spread all over the world in a short time, affected not only physical health but also mental health. There are some risky groups where the disease can progress faster than other people and cause more severe consequences. One of these risky groups is cancer patients with suppressed immunity. In this process, isolation measures are vital for cancer patients to protect themselves from coronavirus. Although the isolation measures implemented rapidly in the fight against the coronavirus seriously prevent the spread of the virus, the mental problems it creates can negatively affect cancer patients for a long time. The purpose of this review is to examine the social isolation of cancer patients and their relatives/caregivers during the pandemic, its effects on mental health and healthy coping ways.

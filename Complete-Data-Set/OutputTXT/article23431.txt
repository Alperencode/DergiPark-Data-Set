Makale Başlığı: Küresel bir Harekette Çevirinin Önemi: İslami Feminizm Örneği.
Özet: The internet as we know it today did not exist 20 years ago. In order to be able to create a desired interaction, one had to rely on the print media. For example, feminist authors had little or no influence on the translations of their works and could not comment on them. This raises the question of how the feminist attitude or view of a feminist author was reflected in the target texts? What role does translation play in such an interaction? Based on these questions, this work addresses the relevance of translation in a global movement using the example of Islamic feminism by examining the works and their translations by two feminist authors. The results will determine the role that translation played in the spread of a global movement like feminism in pre-internet times.

Makale Başlığı: The relationship between ulcerative colitis activity and vitamin D, mean platelet volume and platelet  distribution width
Özet: Aim: In our study, we aimed to show the relationship between ulcerative colitis activity and vitamin D, platelet distribution width, and mean platelet volume. Material and Method: Our study was conducted at the Internal Medicine Clinic. We planned to cross-sectionally investigate the severity of ulcerative colitis activity, vitamin D level, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width and other laboratory parameters of patients admitted to the hospital. The Truelove and Witts’ severity index was used to determine ulcerative colitis activity. In accordance with the guidelines, serum 25-OH vitamin D levels of >30 ng/ml were considered as sufficient vitamin D, 20-30 ng/ml as vitamin D insufficiency, <20 ng/ml as vitamin D deficiency, and <10 ng/ml as severe vitamin D deficiency. Results: The study included 77 ulcerative colitis patients. Of the patients with severe ulcerative colitis activity, 10% had vitamin D deficiency and 90% had severe vitamin D deficiency (p<0.001). The patients with mild ulcerative colitis activity had the highest mean platelet volume (9.5±0.44), while the patients with severe ulcerative colitis activity had the lowest mean mean platelet volume (7.1±1.52) (p<0.001). Likewise, the patients with mild ulcerative colitis activity had the highest mean platelet distribution width (17.9±1.04), while the patients with severe ulcerative colitis activity had the lowest mean platelet distribution width (14.8±2.04) (p<0.001). Conclusion: This study with a high level of evidence supports that 25-OH vitamin D has an anti-inflammatory effect in inflammatory diseases and that 25-OH vitamin D levels decrease as the disease activity increases. Moreover, the negative correlation between ulcerative colitis activity and mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width is demonstrated.

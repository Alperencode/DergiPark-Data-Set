Makale Başlığı: A Survey About the Determination of Essential Parameters of Surface Treatment Application Decisions
Özet: The masonry materials used on the facades of historical buildings deteriorate rapidly due to environmental and natural factors. Consolidant and water-repellent protective chemical materials are used to prevent the deterioration of the stones and to slow down the degree of deterioration. This study discusses the method of deciding on the consolidant and water-repellent chemical materials in the conservation studies of three critical historical buildings with different characteristics in Istanbul. In this context, a survey study was prepared. Various experts who played an active role in the three historical buildings' management, planning, decision-making, implementation, and supervision participated in the survey. In light of the survey study data, surface treatment applications were made with protective chemical materials in three historical buildings. This study aimed to specify which parameters should be considered when deciding on protective chemical applications, propose the necessary criteria for selecting protective materials, and emphasize the importance of standards.

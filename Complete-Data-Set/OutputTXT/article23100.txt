Makale Başlığı: IS IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS AND COMBAT SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF CRITICAL MANAGEMENT?
Özet: When we examine the description of the past of humanity, we can say that the concept of violence has appeared in every period of the ages, from the paleotic age to the present, in the period of about two million years. When we look at the sociological and psychological roots of  the act of violence, we can say that it is sometimes a cause and sometimes a result in the chain of causality. Due to the breadth of the context of violence, it is very difficult to define it and put it on a conceptual basis. Along with this contextual breadth, as violence becomes widespread and internalized within and between societies, the act of violence becomes more familiar and tends to be normalized. At this point, the concept of symbolic violence comes into play. In this study, the reflections of the symbolic form of violence in organizations will be examined in a critical perspective. The aim of this study is to reveal that symbolic violence is a type of violence that permeates the organizational structure and the management practices of managers, to make it visible and to prevent exposure to violence by raising awareness in people by making a critical analysis.

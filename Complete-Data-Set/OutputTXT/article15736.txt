Makale Başlığı: Determination of Agricultural and Oil Quality Characteristics of Some Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz.) Genotypes in Isparta Ecological Conditions
Özet: Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is an oilseed crop with high oil content and rich in omega fatty acids, which can be cultivated at low cost in marginal agricultural lands fed by only natural precipitation in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, 16 camelina genotypes were used. The genotypes were planted on 25 September 2018 in randomized blocks experimental design with 3 replications and harvested on 10 June 2019. The average plant height of the genotypes was 83.1 (Vniimk 17) to 102.7 cm (Ames 26680), the average number of branches per plant 14.5 (Ames 26665) and 22.2 (Ames 26680), the average number of capsules per plant 589.7 (Ames 26665) and 1344.7 (K-50), 1000 seed weight 0.63 g (Ames 22964) to 0.87 g (Ames 26676), harvest index 5.9% (Ames 26673) to 12.6% (Arslanbey), seed yield 103.1 kg/da (Vniimk 17) to 227.8 kg/ (K-49), oil yield 30.1 kg/da (Vniimk 17) to  66.5 kg/da (Ames 22964) and the oil ratio ranged from 24.6% (Ames 266676) to 30.6 (Ames 22964). In crude oils obtained from the seeds of camelina genotypes consisted of oleic acid 14.37-20.08%, linoleic acid 17.30-24.46%, linolenic acid 37.04-49.98%, and erucic acid 0.21-4.92%. In terms of erucic acid, which is accepted as the most important quality criteria in camelina oil, the presence of erucic acid was lower than 2% in 11 of the genotypes.

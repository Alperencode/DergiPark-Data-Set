Makale Başlığı: Sebr and Taksîm Method in Naḥw Science
Özet: Linguists first mentioned the options that are likely to be united under the same framework in some syntax issues and the possibilities that the same subject directly reminds then they reached the conclusion by eliminating the possibilities that did not reach the goal. They explained the reasons for eliminating the options they excluded from the scope, sometimes in detail and sometimes in outline. Linguists have applied this method, which they call sebr and taksîm, to many subjects. However, their use in some matters has become more prominent. Using this method primarily in the determination of word types, they gathered the words in Arabic under the titles of nouns, verbs and letters and they concluded that no other option was possible in terms of word type. Again they applied this method in the determination of the âmil, which is considered as one of the basic elements of the interaction of words in the sentence, and in the matters of i'râb, which is the result of the interaction in the sentence. In this study, first of all, the sebr and taksîm method will be mentioned, then the usage areas of the method will be detailed with examples.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Digital and Traditional Book Publishing According to Countries
Özet: There are three breaking stages that affect the workflow and technology of book publishing: 1. The stage of writing and duplicating books by hand. 2. Stage of mass production of printing technology 3. Stage of production and distribution based on digital technology (e-book). In today's information society, the business model based on printing, which has displaced the production of books written and reproduced by hand in a long historical process, is changed by digital publishing (e-publishing), which decreased the costs of book production (paper, printing, etc.) and distribution, which determines the competitive conditions of the book industry. 	In this study, the production and distribution technology which determines the workflow of the book publishing is evaluated in its historical context. Later, the economic outlook of the book industry which has transformed book publishing into an industry with its economic, technical and social dimensions has been examined in the context of industrialized countries. This paper which aims to reveal the economic and technological view of the historical and structural variables of the book industry, is based on "literature review" and "descriptive study". North America and European Union countries (Germany, France, England, Italy, Spain), Japan and Turkey were chosen as the sample of the study. Japan was included in the sample because it is a great economic power, and Turkey was included in the study in order to see the place of book publishing in the general view of the mentioned countries.

Makale Başlığı: Use of Grounded Theory in Social Sciences:  A Sample of Syrians under Temporary Protection and Child Marriages
Özet: One of the most important consequences of the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011 and has lasted for ten years, has been the forced migration of millions of Syrian citizens living mainly in rural areas to neighboring countries. Turkey ranks first among the countries receiving immigration, with nearly four million Syrian refugees it hosts. Such comprehensive social mobility necessarily brings political, social, and economic problems among the host population and the communities under temporary protection. One of these issues that emerges as a social problem and requires a political solution is child marriages. This article aims to observe the systematic efficiency of the grounded theory in social sciences through a case study of child marriages among the Syrians under temporary protection in Turkey. Within the scope of grounded theory, the concepts of "child-men" and "child-women" have been introduced as new concepts to the literature. Based on the concepts extracted as the result of the field research, the article argues that the capacity of the existing humanitarian organizations and local governments should be further developed. Turkey's policymakers should adopt a proactive and pragmatic approach concerning the conditions that give rise to the phenomenon of child marriages, the factors that facilitate or impede it, and the outcomes it yields.

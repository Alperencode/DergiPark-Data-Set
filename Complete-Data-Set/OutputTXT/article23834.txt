Makale Başlığı: The Neolithic in the South Caucasian Mil Steppe: A Diverse Mosaic
Özet: This article provides a synthetic overview on recent research into the Neolithic settlement history in the Mil Steppe of southern Azerbaijan. Short-lived and closely spaced, these settlement sites represent short-term and shifting occupations during a narrow time range, from 5800 to 5300 BCE. A highly diverse material culture attests to variable cultural affiliations of the populations, indicating some influx of ceramic craft traditions from regions to the south, in particular the Iranian highlands. In comparison with neighboring regions, the place of the Mil Steppe Neolithic within the wider context of Neolithic South Caucasia is evaluated as a distinctive regional variety.

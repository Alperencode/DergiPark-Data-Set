Makale Başlığı: Interpretation of the Qur'an from a Meaningful Learning Perspective
Özet: Summary   In today's informing approach, rather than memorizing and transferring information, it is essential to conceptualize the information to make it meaningful (learning by understanding), to extract principles from the information and to solve problems with the learned information. Learning becomes meaningful when the individual discovers the relationship between concepts in learning and makes comments on them. When the knowledge in question is not ordinary knowledge, but the knowledge of understanding the Qur'an, I think this issue is of great importance.       In this study, we tried to understand whether it would be possible to understand the Qur'an from the perspective of "meaningful learning", which is a type of learning. Our study consists of an introduction, four chapters and a conclusion. In the introduction, we mentioned that today's Muslims have insufficient knowledge and understanding of the Qur'an. In the first part, we focused on the nature of the concept of “knowledge”. In the second part, we focused on the importance of the meaning of the Qur'an. In the third part, we focused on the theory of "meaningful learning". In the fourth chapter, we presented examples of the meaningful learning interpretation of the Qur'an. Kay Konseptse: Meaningful learning, knowledge, meaning, tafsir, hermeneutics, prudence, opinion, interpretation

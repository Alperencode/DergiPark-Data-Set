Makale Başlığı: A review on diclofenac degradation, transformation products and their fate in the environment
Özet: Diclofenac has been one of the widely consumed pharmaceuticals for human and veterinary purposes. The research studies are devoted to investigating its removal from wastewater since its adverse effect on the environment and the organisms have been revealed. Despite its microgram level concentrations in the wastewater or water bodies, it could disrupt the endocrine system, which leads to problems in the metabolism of the higher-level organisms and, thereby, the ecosystem. Therefore, urgent measures should be taken to control diclofenac starting from its consumption and extending to the efficient diclofenac treatment, determination of discharge standards, or the high-level protection of aquatic life. Another problem with diclofenac is the degradation end-products that form through photolysis, or biological reactions remain in the wastewater treatment plants' effluent. These transformation products create further threats for the organisms. This review paper aims to emphasize the adverse effects of diclofenac on the environment, the primary diclofenac sources, its endocrine disrupting effects on the animals, metabolism in the human body, treatment approaches, type of biological and chemical degradation metabolites, or transformation products.

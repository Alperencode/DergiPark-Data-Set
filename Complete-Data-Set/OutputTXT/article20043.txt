Makale Başlığı: The Becoming Muslim of Salmân al-Fârisî in the Context of Sîra-Hadith Relationship
Özet: Sîra, which deals with the life of the Prophet, has the most common points with hadith among the Islamic sciences. In fact, some scholars have accepted the science of history that included also sîra, as a sub-branch of hadith. The presence of a rich sîra material in hadith works and the transference of the narrations of the historian narrators such as al-Zuhri and Ibn Ishâq in these works strengthened the bond between the two sciences.Although sîra and hadith have many common points in terms of method and content, there are also aspects where they differ from each other. For example, in sîra, it is not given the isnad as much importance as in hadith. Likewise, determining the date and place of events in hadith is not one of the main objectives. Because both sciences have different aims and methods. Therefore, should be paid attention to these in studies addressing these two areas.In this article, as an example of sîra-hadith connection, The informations related to becoming müslim of Salmân al-Fârisî in al-Kutub al-Tis‘ah has been evaluated by comparing it with the sources of the first period sîra. In particular, it is noteworthy that Ibn Ishâq, who is both a historian and a muhaddith, directs the narrations in both fields.

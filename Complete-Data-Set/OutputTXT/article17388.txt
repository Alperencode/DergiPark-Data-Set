Özet: Wound, depending on the deterioration of the anatomical and physical integrity of living tissue; It can be defined as the situation in which all or some of the existing physiological activities of the tissue disappear. Today, many different treatment protocols are frequently used in current wound treatments in order to accelerate wound healing and shorten the process. Medical products that emerged depending on the developing technology and developments in the field of medicine also affected the course of treatment. In this study, it was aimed to histopathologically examine the effects of ointments containing C. asiatica extract, zinc oxide and alaptidum on wound healing in cut wounds in Winstar albino rats. For this purpose, 36 winstar albino rats were randomly divided into groups of twelve and then six groups among themselves. The created study groups were grouped as 5th and 10th days. After shaving and disinfection under general anesthesia, 2 cut wounds were created in the right and left areas of the back, including all layers, and ointments were applied to these wounds’ morning and evening. At the end of the 5th and 10th days, the samples taken from the sacrified rats were sent to the laboratory for histopathological examination. At the end of the study, it was observed that epithelial regeneration was completed earlier and fibrovascular connective tissue proliferation matured earlier in the groups in which ointments containing alaptidum and zinc oxide were applied.

Makale Başlığı: Body image disturbance in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: correlation with deformity perception, trunk aesthetic, and quality of life
Özet: Purpose: In adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis, a disturbance in body image is the one of main complaint. Hence, concerns related-body image perceptions may be related to the deformity perception, trunk aesthetics and daily functioning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the body image disturbance and its association among deformity perception, trunk aesthetic, and quality of life in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).Methods: A total of 105 patients with AIS were included in the study. Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire-Scoliosis (BIDQ-S) for body image disturbance, Walter Reed Visual Assessment Scale (WRVAS) and Trunk Appearance Perception Scale (TAPS) for perception of patient’s deformity, Trunk Aesthetic Clinical Evaluation (TRACE) for trunk aesthetic and Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) for quality of life were used. Pearson Correlation test were used to compare the data obtained in the study.Results: The mean age of patients was 14.05±2.29 years, and the mean Cobb angles were 25.1±9.2° (ranged from 10° to 52°) for primary curve. The BIDQ-S demonstrated very good correlated to the SRS-22 total (r=-0.672, p<0.001) and pain domain (r=-0.631, p<0.001), the WRVAS (r=0.713, p<0.001), TAPS (r=0.672, p<0.001) and TRACE (r=0.614, p<0.001). There was a good correlation between BIDQ-S and other SRS-22 activity, image, and mental domains (r=-0.520; r=-0.518; r=-0.572, p<0.001). No correlation was found between BIDQ-S and the SRS-22 satisfaction domain (r=-0.102; p=0.296).Conclusion: Body image disturbances strongly related with the patients’ perception of deformity, trunk aesthetic, and quality of life.

Management of genetic resources; includes conservation, enrichment, characterization, evaluation and documentation. 354 local female and male fig cultivars/genotypes collected from the fig growing regions of the country through survey and selection studies within the body of the Fig Research Institute Directorate in Aydın Province, Turkey, have been taken under protection in the fig field gene bank. Hatay Olive Research Institute Directorate is the second degree responsible institution for the conservation of fig genetic resources. In this study, fig field gene bank and studies of “Fig (Ficus carica L.) Genetic Resources Conservation and Characterization” project work and world fig field gene banks studies are included.

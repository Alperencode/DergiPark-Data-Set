Makale Başlığı: THE SHIFT FROM INTERNATIONAL TO GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY:  ACTORS, FRAMEWORKS, AND CHALLENGES
Özet: During the last two decades, particularly with the acceleration of globalization, there has been a proliferation of new actors in the field of global health. This resulted in a shift from international health governance (IHG) model, which recognizes nation state as the core actor, to global health governance (GHG) model, which incorporates civil society organizations and businesses. This article will explore this shift from IHG to GHG from multiple angles. It will first shed light on the historical origins of this phenomenon and then analyze the role of each actor that constitute these models. This will be followed by an assessment of the tension between vertical and horizontal approaches to global health policy. The article will finally underline the main challenges that are ahead of global health governance. These challenges are neglected tropical diseases (NTD), social determinants of health (SDH), public private partnerships (PPP), and intellectual property rights (IPR).

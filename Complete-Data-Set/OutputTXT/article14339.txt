Makale Başlığı: Britain’s Caliphate Policy in the Light of Archival Documents (1875-1925)
Özet: In this article, Britain's half-century (1875-1925) caliphate policy has been examined based on the Public Record Office (PRO). Britain sought ways to take advantage of the Ottoman caliph's influence over the Muslims of the world towards the end of the nineteenth century. İt changed his policy, worrying about the influence of the Ottoman caliph on the Muslims after it colonized İndia. From the beginning of the twentieth century, Britain has made the efforts to wear down the Ottoman caliph an important part of its foreign policy.Britain, who wanted the Caliphate to be taken from the Ottomans and given to the Arabs, had definitely decided that the Ottoman caliphate should remain in history before the Lausanne Conference. Turkey's abolished the caliphate and breaking ties with the Muslim world was of great importance in terms of England. At that time, in terms of the interests of Britain, Turkey that will be set up smaller than in the past were be useful against Russia.

Makale Başlığı: Effects of Mucilage on Safety Navigation in the Turkish Straits
Özet: Mucilage, which has surrounded the Marmara Sea and the Turkish Straits in particular for the last few months, is a gel-like and slippery mass of microorganisms that are mostly clumped together and cover large areas, consisting of proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids released out of the body by single-celled organisms under stressful environmental conditions. Although the Turkish Straits sea area is the waterway connecting the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, it is essential to transition for marine species. The mucilage effect on the filtration of the ship systems is caused by the seawater used by the ship's cooling systems during the passage through the straits. Due to the protection of local and global sea areas, a high level of attention is needed, especially on significant waterways located on the transit route of ships moving to many ports of the world serving global transportation such as the Turkish Straits. The study is trying to describe Mucilage's effects on ships during sailing at the Turkish Straits.

Makale Başlığı: New Content Marketing Device in Cultural Diplomacy: Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR)
Özet: Discussing Turkey's cultural diplomacy devices around some popular culture content determines the tendencies of researchers and communication professionals. Cultural diplomacy relations, shaped as a field of ideological struggle and competition for reputation, also become the catalyst forces of a history of representation in which nations are staged as brand value in an age where fluid cultures converge. Although the idea of marketability of culture attracts the production movements of the cultural industries concept and critical theory, it is seen that the market created by cultural diplomacy has a unique industrial value. This study aims to discuss alternative trends for Turkey's cultural diplomacy activities that are reduced to some devices and are likely to enter a vicious circle, and to build the initial interest required to integrate these trends into an integrated marketing tool for controlled image actions. Because all the moves of the culture industries require trans-media narrative synergy as part of an integrated marketing strategy. In this context, Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which is discussed as a cultural diplomacy device, is important because it is a new type of stimulative/triggering narrative style that causes relief due to the tingling sensation in the listener/watcher. In this study, new possibilities for nation branding will be discussed by making a theoretical reading on the communication power of ASMR in the cultural diplomacy dimension.

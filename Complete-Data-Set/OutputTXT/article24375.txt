Makale Başlığı: Cost Analysis of Different Mixture Rates and Sowing Methods of Anatolian Clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.) and Italian Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)
Özet: The study was carried out between 2015 and 2016 in accordance with the split plots in randomized blocks research design with 3 replications, which aimed to determine the optimal mixture rate for the production design. The results of the research were made into agricultural implementation and cost analysis was performed. Relative profit margin was used in determining the most favorable mixture rate that will be included in the production design. According to the application results, the production threshold was exceeded in all mixtures. The highest gross production value (95.90 USD da-1) and production cost (59.05 USD da-1) was obtained from the sole Anatolian Clover among the forage crop mixtures. Whereas; the lowest gross production value (71.32 USD da-1) and production cost (58.60 USD) was detected in the sole Italian ryegrass application. In addition to this, it was found that the highest relative profit margin (1.62) had been achieved in sole Anatolian clover. 50% Anatolian clover + 50% Italian ryegrass (K2) (1.40), 25% Anatolian clover + 75% Italian ryegrass (K3) (1.38) were followed to sole Anatolian clover, in terms of mixture rates.  Perdenpedicular row sowing (E3) had the highest relative profit margin (1.45) in this study according to the sowing methods. As a consequently, perpendicular rows (E3) and sole Anatolian clover (T), 25A.C + 75 I.R (K3) were the most suitable sowing method and mixture ratios under Anatolian conditions, respectively.

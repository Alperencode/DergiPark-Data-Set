Makale Başlığı: A RESEARCH ON CLASSROOM PERCEPTION AND SATISFACTION OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS: THE CASE OF BEDRI RAHMI EYUBOGLU ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN TRABZON
Özet: This study was based on the assumption that physical factors affecting spatial perception havenot been considered in the design of current classrooms where students are educated and have not beendesigned to contribute positively to the development and performance of students, so the goal of the studyis to determine the physical characteristics in the spatial perception of the classroom of children aged 7-10and their satisfaction with these physical characteristics. The study was set up in two stages, with an on-sitedetection study of the current situation in the classrooms of an elementary school located in the provinceof Trabzon in the first stage, while in the second stage, a planned face-to-face interview was conducted with205 randomly selected students and the obtained data were analyzed in the SPSS software. As a result of theanalysis, it was confirmed that students’ favorite places in their schools are their classrooms, and a classroomis an important pl+ace for students in their perceptions. When students’ narratives of their classrooms andnarratives of the classrooms of their dreams were evaluated together, it was determined that the furniture inthe classrooms was the most rememberable item for the students. The impact of classroom space in students’perception has become particularly evident with the physical properties (color, configuration, form, size,etc.) of the architectural building materials (wall, door, floor color, etc.) and the furniture in the space. Thesematerials have been heavily contained in the children’s narrative and expression about their classrooms.

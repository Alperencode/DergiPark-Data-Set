Makale Başlığı: A Single Center Experience of Refugees in a Developing Country
Özet: AbstractObjectives:  Due to the civil wars and bad living conditions in neighboring countries, the number of refugees has been increasing. In this study, it was aimed to examine the demographic data of the refugees who admitted to our hospital, and the reasons for their admissions.Material and Methods:  All refugee records that admitted to outpatient and inpatient clinics between 2015-2019 were evaluated from the hospital automation system. Over the years, parameters such as total number of patients, and repeated admissions, age, gender, and nationality of the patients were recorded. The reasons for the hospitalization in the Infectious Diseases Clinic and whether there were any vaccine-preventable diseases were investigated.Results: In a 5-year period, a total of 92558 patients admitted to the hospital for 261095 times. Recurrent admission rate ranged from 59% (2017) to 84% (2019). More than half of the patients were between the ages of 20-39 and, 48% were male. The percentage of Syrian refugees was always above 60%. While the number of patients followed in inpatient clinics was 1.407 in 2015, it was 7.109 in 2019. By 2019, there was a four-fold increase in internal outpatient and 2.5-fold increase in surgical outpatient clinic admissions. The number of births has been determined as 479, 881, 850, 2651 and 3091, respectively over the years. Pneumonia and gastroenteritis were the most common reasons for hospitalization in adult and pediatric infectious diseases clinics; of the patients, 25 were diagnosed with acute viral hepatitis, 21 were vaccine-preventable diseases, 11 were diagnosed with mucocutaneous leishmaniosis, and four patients with malaria.Conclusion: The number of refugees referred to our hospital has been increasing. The number of births, hospitalizations and operations increases in proportion to the admission numbers. The improvement of the living conditions of the refugees and the necessary immunization remain important for preventive medicine.

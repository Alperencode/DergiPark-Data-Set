Özet: Peer bullying is a common form of behavior among adolescents. In peer bullying, adolescents attack their peers physically, socially, psychologically, etc. areas of violence.  In this respect, bullying is an important behavioral problem among adolescents, which includes continuity, power imbalance, and deliberateness. Various studies show the prevalence of peer bullying in Turkey at different levels. The main purpose of this research is to examine the literature publications and reveal the prevalence of peer bullying in Turkey with the meta-analysis method. For this purpose, the meta-analysis method was used in this study. Five evaluation criteria were determined for the publications selected during the meta-analysis process. The research was carried out by selecting 3 theses and 2 articles that met the specified criteria from 75 publications published between 2015 and 2021. The total sample of the study consists of 8221 adolescents. The findings show that an adolescent in Turkey is exposed to peer bullying at least twice during the academic year and is bullied twice. In addition, it has been determined that some structural inconsistencies are arising from ethical committee permissions, evaluation methods of scales, and data processing processes in studies on peer bullying conducted in Turkey. Due to these inconsistencies, many publications could not be included in the meta-analysis process. These issues are detailed in the article and discussed following the literature.

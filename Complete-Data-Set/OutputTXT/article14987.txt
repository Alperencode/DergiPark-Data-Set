Özet: Sheikh Muhammad Diya-al-din Norshini (Hadhrat) is a scholar and teacher of the last era of Ottoman Empire. Diya-al-din was born in 1856 in town of Hizan of Bedlis and was known by the nickname “Hadhrat”. Diya-al-din received his first education with his father, Sheikh Abdurrahman-i Tahi (d. 1886), then continued his education with famous scholars such as Sheikh Fethullah-i Verkanisi (d. 1899) and received his caliphate from also Sheikh Fethullah-i Verkanisi. In 1889, Sheikh Fethullah appointed him as the irshad. Hezret started his work as a religious guidance in Bedlis and nearby settlements and later he also supervise the Dervish Lodge of Norshin. Ziyaeddin has an important place in the Khalidi Naqshbandi sect and he also gave the authorization of religious and science to many people.  Sheikh Muhammad Diya-al-din Norshini fought against the Russian troops in the First World War as a member of voluntary units and lost his arm. Also, his brothers Muhammad Said and Muhammad Ashraf were martyred in the war. Sheikh Muhammad Ziyaeddin died in 1924 and his grave is in Norshin. According to the information that we have, his work consisting of his letters was published by the name Mektubat. Until now, this poem had not been included in the literature and there was no awareness of the existence of Hathrat's poetry. In this work, we will focus on one of his poems that has not been published yet and we will evaluate this poem from the point of view of authorship and content and present the transcribed text along with the manuscript. By this research, literary and mystical side of Ziyaeddin will become clearer in the context of Khalidity’s tradition.

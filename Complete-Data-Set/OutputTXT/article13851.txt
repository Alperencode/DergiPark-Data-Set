Makale Başlığı: LAW APPLICABLE TO FORM OF WILLS WITH FOREIGN  ELEMENT
Özet: Wills can have a foreign element due to reasons arising from the place where the will is made, the place of the disposable estate or the person who made the will. Conflict of laws rules regarding the law applicable to form of wills with foreign element are laid down in the Turkish Code on Private International Law and International Civil Procedure no. 5718 (the PIL Code) article 20/4 and The Con-vention of 5 October 1961 on the Conflicts of Laws Relating to the Form of Testa-mentary Dispositions. According to article 1/2 of the PIL Code, the conflict of laws rules in the Convention should be applied primarily in determining the law to be applied to the form of wills with foreign elements. In terms of determining the law to be applied to the form of wills article 20/4 of the PIL Code will only be app-licable in cases where Turkey has made reservations to the Convention and in cases where the decedent died before the Convention entered into force.

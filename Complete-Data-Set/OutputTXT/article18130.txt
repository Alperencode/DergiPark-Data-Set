Makale Başlığı: Libraries in the Information Age: A Theoretical Examination
Özet: While information age, which is surrounded by information and communication technologies, transformed many things such as industrial, commercial, social and economic structures, libraries, which have an important place among educational, cultural and social organizations, have started to shape their policies and services within this framework. The purpose of this study is to make a theoretical inquiry about how libraries and librarians have transformed themselves in line with these developments and changes, what problems they face and what needs to be done. The study is a compilation study based on related literature reviews. Within the scope of the study, information society and related concepts, the topics of information literacy and digital libraries and problems of digital libraries are examined. As a result of the study, it was understood that the structures of post-industrial societies shaped by globalization and technology have moved the role of information and also the way they interact with information to a much stronger level, and have transformed libraries significantly. Problems such as adaptation, digital gap, information pollution, lack of information and technology literacy in the transformation processes should be addressed within the framework of the coordination of all relevant stakeholders (professional staff, public and private institutions, voluntary organizations, etc.) with the support of governments.

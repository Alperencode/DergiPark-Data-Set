Makale Başlığı: An Important Resource for the History of Military Technical Branches: Journal for Science Branches
Özet: The history of military publications in Turkey dates back to the newspaper Ceride-i Askeriye (Military Newspaper) started to be published in 1864. From that date until abolition of Ottoman Empire, various periodical official military newspapers and journals were published especially for land and marine forces.  In the Republican period, we observe that a certain section of those newspapers and journals were still published. In addition, Turkish Armed Forces started to publish journals special to military classes in order to both improve professional knowledge of existing officers and provide new officers with technical information on their military units since 1925. One should note that in addition to the journals of three main units (sunûf-ı selase) of the army, namely infantry, artillery and cavalry, a journal special to the units of communication, engineering and railways, named as Science Branches (Fen Kıtaâti) at that time was also published in this period. In this study, we shall provide detailed information on the journal, started to be published with the title of “Fen Kıtaâti Mecmuası” (Journal for Science Branches) and published until 1948 with few modifications to its title.

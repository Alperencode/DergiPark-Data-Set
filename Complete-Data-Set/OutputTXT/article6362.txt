Makale Başlığı: A proposal for the reading of the Lycian inscription TL 106
Özet: It is proposed that the inscription be segmented at a different point to the usual, namely, immediately before ñneti. The content of the second curse is then that the perpetrator shall be defiled commensurately with the defilement of the tomb, i.e., a singular case of a talion not attested elsewhere in Lycian inscriptions, nor in Greek inscriptions from Lycia. A request to bury "my" wife and "my" children follows as an additional, third part to the inscription as originally planned, then a further addition of two persons. The verb ñneti is also attested in a non-funereal inscription, probably a treaty, and replaces here the usual verbs for "to bury". Placing the verb at the beginning of the sentence is also unusual, and this may have led the epigrapher to add it, without a word divider, onto the end of the second line.

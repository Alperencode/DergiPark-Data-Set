Makale Başlığı: Peak shaving and technical loss minimization in distribution grids: a  time-of-use-based pricing approach for distribution service tariffs
Özet: Deployment of time-of-use  ToU -based retail energy tariffs  i.e. tariff for energy consumption- not the tariff  for distribution service  is a common practice to incentivize consumers to use more energy at off-peak times. Distribution  service tariffs  DSTs  are usually time-independent, which results in insensitivity of load to the distribution service cost.  However, DST can also be time-dependent, which is studied in this paper. This study presents a methodology to address  the effect of ToU pricing  i.e. time-dependent  of DSTs on peak shaving and technical loss minimization in power  distribution grids. Here, the main focus is to assess the level of consumers' responses to ToU-based DSTs. Addressing  such a problem necessitates detailed modeling of the distribution grid  including low-voltage grid  on the one hand  and accurate modeling of the elasticity of consumers to ToU-based DSTs on the other hand. The other significant  factor is the share of DST-originated cost within the total bill of the consumers. Considering these factors, the proposed  approach is implemented on the pilot networks in the region of service associated with different distribution companies in  Turkey. Response of consumers to ToU-based DSTs are addressed quantitatively in terms of peak shaving and technical  loss minimization in the pilot regions. In addition, financial aspects of ToU-based DSTs are outlined from distribution  companies and consumers standpoints.

Makale Başlığı: A New Implementing Approach for Tracking Algorithm on Photovoltaic Systems
Özet: This paper introduces a modelling technique to overcome the lack of solar cell modules in most of the circuit simulation that deals with the microcontrollers. The new implementation is based on Proteus which is one of the most popular platforms. To emulation close to reality, it aims to simulate the MSX-60 panel based on mathematical equations within the possibility of varying the temperature and the incidence irradiation. Besides testing the validity of the proposed system via comparing the IV and the PV characteristic with the one provided by the datasheet, the paper proposed a technique for executing a tracking voltage algorithm implements by a PIC18F4580 microcontroller on the proposed system that consists of a variable input source PV system feeds a load with the pre-existence of a power electronic device as an intermediate. Buck converter is using here to get access to the best performance in case of disorder simultaneously with chasing the desirable output voltage. The detailed discrete PI algorithm implementing process and the mapping technique with the other associated accessories presented here are rarely found elsewhere. Simulation results proved the validity of the proposed modelling by confirming the relation between both the irradiation and temperature with voltage. In the closed-loop control system of the buck converter, the proposed system all showed a perfect response regarding the voltage tracking and chasing the desired voltage irrespective of varying the ambient temperature and the irradiation.

Makale Başlığı: Knowledge and Attitudes Of University Students About Breast Cancer And Breast Self Examination
Özet: Aim: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women. Therefore, breast self- examination (BSE) is important for breast cancer awareness and for women to recognize the natural state of their own breasts. In this study, it is aimed to determine the knowledge and attitudes of university students about BSE.Material and Method:First of all, a BSE form was created by scanning the literature, which measures the breast cancer awareness and self-examination knowledge of the participants. Afterwards, students over the age of 20 who are studying at the Faculty of Health Sciences were asked to fill out the BSE information form and the data were analyzed.Results:150 students who met the conditions suitable for the study were included. All of the students are female and all of them are single. It was determined that there were 101 (67.3%) students who had previously received BSE education. Despite this, it was determined that there were 28 (18.7%) students who regularly performed BSE every month. When the answers given by those who have received BSE training are examined; A significant relationship was found between having BSE training and knowing when BSE should be done correctly and self- confidence in performing BSE (p<0.001).Conclusion:It is very important to provide BSE education to women in the risky age group for them to do it correctly and effectively. In addition, breast cancer awareness should be increased for BSE practices in women's lives.

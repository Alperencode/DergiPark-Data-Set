Makale Başlığı: Is there any effect of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination on electrocardiographic parameters in patients without apparent cardiovascular disease?
Özet: Objective: Electrocardiographic alterations were investigated following the second dosage of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Methods: A total of 260 individuals after two doses of COVID-19 vaccine with Pfizer-BioNTech were included in the study. The electrocardiographic parameters recorded at baseline and approximately one week later after two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were compared for all patients. Results: PR interval was increased and QTc maximum interval was decreased significantly after second dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Baseline and post-second dose vaccination states regarding P wave dispersion and QT dispersion/Tp-e interval which have been recognized to imply inhomogeneous atrial conduction and heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization were similar between groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there should be no concern related to asymptomatic involvement of the myocardium subsequent the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

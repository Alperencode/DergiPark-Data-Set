Makale Başlığı: A New Approach to Turkish Land Management: The Case of Amasya District
Özet: The need to effectively manage scarce land resources by sustainable development goals has led to a gradual expansion in the content and scope of the traditional cadastre understanding. In this context, today from the cadastre; It is expected to record and secure the individual/public rights and restrictions in the vertical as well as the horizontal dimension of the land in a continuous, accessible, and comprehensive manner, as well as provide a basis for planning activities in a broad sense and support the taxation activities of the public. On the other hand, this expansion in the content and scope of the cadastre has caused the traditional 2 Dimension (2D) cadastre understanding to be insufficient to meet the new requirements. This situation has brought the concept of 3 Dimension (3D) cadastre to the agenda by developing technology. With the completion of cadastral works in Turkey in the recent period, various projects have been started to be implemented by General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (TKGM) to create the future vision of cadastre in parallel with the developments in the world. One of the projects in question is the "3D City Models and the Integration of Cadastre Bases Pilot Project", which was implemented in Amasya in 2020. The study aimed to touch on the general framework and basic principles of the project above.

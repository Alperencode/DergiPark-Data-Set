Makale Başlığı: Research on the Determination of Some Tomato Cultivars Reactions to Oidium neolycopersici and the Disease Control
Özet: This study was carried out in greenhouses of the Plant Protection Department at Ege University Faculty of Agriculture in 2008-2010. Six economically important tomato cultivars (Gökçe F1, Kardelen F1, Bandita F1, Falcon, SC 2121 and Shasta F1) were tested for their resistance against powdery mildew caused by Oidium neolycopersici. Biological, chemical and alternative materials such as Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Triadimenol, Bacillus subtilis QST strain 713, sulphur (wettable powder), watered ozone were tested on a susceptible tomato cultivar to control the pathogen. Results indicated that; all tested tomato varieties were sensitive to powdery mildew caused by O. neolycopersici. Among the tested materials, Bacillus subtilis QST strain 713 had the best efficacy in controlling the pathogen. Triadimenol and sulphur had average, whereas H2O2 and ozone had low control over the pathogen.

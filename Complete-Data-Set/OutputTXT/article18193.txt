Makale Başlığı: Determination of Radiation Exposure of Students During Their Internships Using OSL Dosimeter
Özet: To keep the radiation exposure under control is the golden rule for radiation protection. Radiation dose monitoring is performed for radiation workers however no dose follow-up has for students. So in this study it was aimed to determine the level of radiation exposure of students who trained in medical imaging techniques program. Methods: This work is assessed the radiation exposure of 132 students during their internships in the department of radiology, nuclear medicine and oncology with the aid of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters between the years of 2017-2019. Results: For the students in the roles of trainers, maximum accumulated equivalent doses were found to be 2.07 and 2.14 mSv for body Hp(10) and skin Hp(0.07), respectively. The minimum accumulated equivalent dose was 0.00 mSv for 112 students both body and skin. The mean Hp(10) and Hp(0,07) for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th periods were calculated as 0.38±0.23mSv and 0.35±0.20mSv, 0.42±0.27mSv and 0.34±0.23mSv, 0.37±0.18mSv and 0.30±0.12mSv, 0.63±0.22mSv and 0.34±0.04mSv, respectively. Conclusions: It was determined that all absorbed doses found under the radiation safety regulations. However, it was seen that some students whose absorbed dose were found a little bit high acted more courageous with the self-confidence.

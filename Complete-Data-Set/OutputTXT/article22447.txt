Makale Başlığı: EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN STATE FORMATION IN AFRICA: AN EVALUATION OF PRE-COLONIAL AND POST-COLONIAL ERA
Özet: It is generally accepted that colonialism lies at the root of many social and political problems in today’s Africa. One of the biggest obstacles to the sustainable solution to these problems is the incomplete institutionalization of weak or failed states in Africa. This article aims to put forward an explanation based on policies implemented during the colonial period regarding “the failure of state formation” problems in Africa. The study gives examples of states with effective administration in Africa before the colonial era and touches upon their vital role in international relations to properly evaluate the differences between pre-colonial and post-colonial periods. However, the eradication of these African states and the enslavement of African nations after the colonial occupation marked the beginning of a new era and paved the way for the state formation problems in Africa, which are still present. Despite this adverse impact of colonialism, Africans had managed to gain their independence through the right to self-determination with the international community’s support and took a significant step towards statehood. Even though many African nations received their independence from colonial powers, it is hard to say that they healthily completed their statehood process. The problems experienced by the African states in question are also evaluated in accordance with the criteria set out in the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Last but not least, this article will try to explain how the dependency relationships of African nations, particularly with the former colonial powers, made their state formation process difficult.

Makale Başlığı: A Study on Relationships Between Different Udder Measurements and Milk Yield Characteristics in Awassi Sheep
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the phenotypic corelations between different udder sizes and marketable milk yield in Awassi sheep. The animal material of the study consisted of primiparous vs multiparous sheep. Marketable milk yield and udder sizes were determined after weaning in sheep. The correlations between the examined features were calculated with the SPSS package program. At the end of the study, positive and significant (P<0.05 and P<0.01) correlations were calculated between teat length, teat circumference and udder width over the teat, and marketable milk yield. It has been evaluated that these correlations can be used in the selection of the breeding stocks.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Genetic Diversity in Banana and Bell Pepper Lines Using Molecular Markers
Özet: Successful hybrid cultivar breeding is depend on the high genetic diversity of the plant sources, as well as the homozygous and genetically distant lines requiring hybridization. The aim of this study is to determine the genetic distance between the inbred lines of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in order to increase efficacy of the breeding program. In this study, the genetic distances between the inbred lines of 44 bell peppers and 35 banana peppers were investigated using the SRAP (Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism) markers. Based on pattern scores, dendrograms were produced by the UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method of mathematical averages method). Out of the 71 primer combinations tested, 50 combinations revealed polymorphisms among the banana pepper lines, and a total of 123 polymorphic bands were obtained. In the bell pepper lines, 24 SRAP primer combinations were tested and 15 combinations had 25 polymorphic bands. Based on the UPGMA cluster analysis, the pepper lines divided into groups as bell peppers and banana peppers. While the genetic similarity among the banana pepper lines varied between 0.62 and 0.98, the genetic similarity among the bell pepper lines varied between 0.54 and 1.00. As a result, it can be stated that the SRAP markers can be used successfully for determining the genetic distances of the pepper inbred lines thus will help the breeding programme.

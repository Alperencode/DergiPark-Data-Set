Makale Başlığı: Experimental Investigation of the Effect of Nitromethane Addition to Gasoline Fuel on A Single-Cylinder Spark-Ignition Engine Performance and Emissions
Özet: In this study, the effect of nitromethane addition to gasoline fuel on engine perfor-mance and emissions in a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine was experimentally inves-tigated. By adding 5% and 10% nitromethane to gasoline, experiments were carried out at full load at six different cycles. Engine load, fuel consumption, exhaust gas tempera-ture, and emissions were measured during the experiments. According to the measured experimental data, engine power, torque, specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas tem-perature, average effective pressure, thermal efficiency, CO, CO2, HC, and NOx values were compared with each other. According to these results, nitromethane's addition im-proved engine power, torque, specific fuel consumption, and thermal efficiency. It is un-derstood that the addition of nitromethane to gasoline improves combustion efficiency and increases thermal efficiency. With the addition of nitromethane, an increase in CO2 emission, which is a product of complete combustion, and a decrease in CO emission occurred. This supports the increase in combustion efficiency. HC emissions have de-creased. There has been an increase in NOx emissionsIn addition, since the addition of more than 10% nitromethane causes engine instability, it has created difficulties in using it without modification in the engine.

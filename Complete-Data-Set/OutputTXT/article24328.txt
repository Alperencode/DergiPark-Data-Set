Makale Başlığı: Internet Journalism and Work: A Study on the Axis of Labor Process
Özet: This study aims to examine working and news production practises in internet journalism with labor process theory. The assumption of this study is that discussions about technology and transformation in the internet journalism literature is far from providing a holistic understanding of transformation. However, examining the transformation with the labor process theory will contribute to elimination of this deficiency. In this study new technologies, news production on the internet and working conditions are examined as components of journalists’ labor process and how the important effect of technology in this process has transformed the labor process as a whole is discussed. Thus, contrary to the main stream in the literature, it will be questioned whether the internet is an absolute liberating space for journalists. In this context, in-depth interviews were conducted on journalism practices with ten journalists working on internet media and non-systematic observations were made in seven offices. The findings were classified on the conceptual framework of the debate. In the first part of the article, the transformation that new communication technologies create on journalism will be discussed, and in the second part, the main problem areas of journalists will be determined in the context of labor process. In the third chapter, the labor processes in internet journalism will be tried to be revealed with the findings from the field

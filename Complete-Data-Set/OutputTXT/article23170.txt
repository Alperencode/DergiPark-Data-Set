Makale Başlığı: Traditional Tattoos among the Baraks of Gaziantep, Identity Construction, and Gender Relations
Özet: This article examines, in the context of identity construction and gender relations, the fading practice of tattooing among the Gaziantep Baraks of Anatolia. From a historical perspective and specifically in the context of power dynamics, the study explores the embodiment of cultural patterns as the body becomes a ‘space of performance’ through tattooing. It argues that the body is not unreservedly and passively subject to power structures —rather, it is a constituent element in identity construction. The article is based on field research conducted through participant observation and in-depth interviews in March 2014 in the villages located in Barak plain, Gaziantep Province. The research reveals that the tattoo became fashionable among the Baraks shortly after it was commercialized. The findings also indicate that this practice may have been strategically abandoned in the process of connecting and adapting to the national/supraethnic identity

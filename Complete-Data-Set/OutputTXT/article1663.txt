Makale Başlığı: Determination of time dependent antibacterial activities of curcumin, carvacrol and styrax liquidus on Salmonella Enteritidis
Özet: Salmonella Enteritidis is amongst the most common causes of foodborne salmonellosis. Multi-drug resistant Salmonella strains has been associated with treatment failures. Plant-derived phytochemicals may be an alternative to antibiotics in combating these bacteria. The purpose of this study is to investigate the antibacterial activity of curcumin, carvacrol and styrax liquidus on S. Enteritidis and S. Enteritidis PT4. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of these substances were detected at 1.5, 3, 7.5 and 24 h by broth microdilution method to evaluate their time-dependent antibacterial activities. The findings of the present study showed that MIC values of carvacrol, curcumin and styrax liquids for both S. Enteritidis and S. Enteritidis PT4 were 125.0 μg/mL, 132.5 μg/mL, 31.3 mg/mL for 24 h, respectively. Also, a time-dependent change was observed in the MIC values of curcumin. Carvacrol, curcumin and styrax liquidus can be used to provide antimicrobial effect on S. Enteritidis and S. Enteritidis PT4 in food applications, taking into account the MIC values and contact times.

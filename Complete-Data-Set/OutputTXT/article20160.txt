Makale Başlığı: Gastric Bleeding Case Associated with Hypocalcemia in A Dog
Özet: The presented case report material was composed of a 4-year-old Golden Retriever dog brought to Afyon Kocatepe University Animal Hospital with complaints of weakness, anorexia, severe contraction and incoordination 1.5 months after giving birth. Due to biochemical analysis performed within the scope of anamnesis and clinical symptoms, serum calcium level was measured as 5.81 mg/dL and the patient was diagnosed with hypocalcemia (eclampsia). After the appropriate treatment procedure, all vital findings returned to normal, moderate hematemesis was observed 4 hours after the treatment. It was thought that the effect of hypocalcemia on the coagulation mechanism may cause gastric bleeding. In the biochemical measurement repeated 24 hours after the treatment, serum calcium level was determined as 7.70 mg/dL. In the subsequent follow-ups, no evidence of hematamesis was found and no recurrence was observed. The risk of bleeding disorders in dogs with hypocalcemia is significant and should be considered.

Makale Başlığı: Current Situation of Dairy Cattle Activity in Yozgat Province and Future Expectations of Producers
Özet: This research, it is aimed to determine the current situation of dairy cattle activities in Yozgat province and the expectations of the producers from the future. For this purpose, the data of the research were obtained by surveying with 160 dairy farms enterprises that were determined according to the stratified sampling method and engaged in dairy cattle breeding in the province of Yozgat. According to the findings obtained from the research, it was determined that while the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises obtained an average of 11-15 kg milk yield per animal, 61.3% of large enterprises obtained milk yield between 16-25 kg. When the places where the enterprises sell their milk according to their size are examined, the majority of the small enterprises sell their milk, while the medium-sized enterprises give their milk to the milk collectors, and the majority of the large enterprises sell their milk to the factories. When the children of the business owners are examined, it is determined that 55.9% of the small enterprises do not want their children to continue animal husbandry, but 62.3% of the medium-sized enterprises and 71.0% of the large-scale enterprises want their children to continue animal production. In the dairy cattle farms in Yozgat, the problems of supplying roughage and not being able to market the produced milk comes to the fore. For this reason, there is a need for investment in milk processing facilities and training on marketing in Yozgat province. Farmers with higher milk production potential in the region avoid production due to concerns about not being able to market the milk or selling it at a low price. It is clear that the establishment of milk processing and marketing facilities in the province by both investors and producer associations will increase milk production.

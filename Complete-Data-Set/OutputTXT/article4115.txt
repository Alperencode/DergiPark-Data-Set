Makale Başlığı: Muhammed Asif Muhsinî and His Method of Criticism of Bihâru'l-Envâr
Özet: Hadith sources have an important place in the formation of Shiite thought. There are many scholars who have a critical approach to these sources. However, the majority of these criticisms were made by non-Shiite scholars. On the other hand, there are Shiite scholars who criticize some of the Shiite hadith sources. One of them is Muhammad Asif al-Muhsinî, a contemporary Shiite scholar of Afghan origin. Muhsinî, who has both a religious and a political identity, wrote the work Meşraatu bihâru'l-envâr based on his criticism of Bihâru'l-envâr belonging to Allâme el-Meclisî (d. 1110/1698-9), which is considered one of the important hadith sources of Shia. Muhsinî included his criticism method in his works Meşraa, and Buhûs fî ilmi’r-ricâl. It can be said that the author criticizes many hadith sources widely used in Shia with his methodology. This study aims to introduce the author, who is not sufficiently known in our country, and to reveal the method of criticism over the aforementioned work. In addition, the other works of the author were also examined and the parts of the works related to the subject were partially mentioned. It has been seen that the author’s most important criticisms are directed ricâl and Hadith sources. On the other hand, it was concluded that his criticisms were also criticized by contemporary hadith scholars.

Makale Başlığı: MISCONCEPTION INTERVENTIONS AND PUPILS’ CONCEPTUAL CHANGE IN SELECTED CONCEPTS IN BASIC SCIENCE IN ABEOKUTA
Özet: This study determined the effect of misconceptions intervention on students’ conceptual change in the concepts of density and floatation in basic science. The moderating effects of gender and school types on students conceptual change in the selected concepts were also determined. The misconception interventions in this study are hands-on activities that allow students who engage in them to observe evidence that contradict their misconceptions in density and floatation. Students in the upper basic three were the population of the study. A two-tier multiple-choice test was used to measure the conceptual change. The result revealed that exposing upper basic three students to the misconception intervention is significantly effective in facilitating conceptual change in the selected concept in basic science.

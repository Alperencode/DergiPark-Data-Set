Makale Başlığı: Âşık Bayram Denizoğlu and His Last Folk Tale Âşık Şemirhan and Âşık İbrahim
Özet: Folk tales, which have undertaken many functions on the Turkish nation for centries, have survived as an important cultural element for a long time, but have recently lost their vitality. Today, while the tradition of telling a story depending on the tradition of minstrelsy continues in the Kars region, where the tradition of minstrelsy is still alive, albeit partially, this vitality is not seen in many regions. It is based on the idea that folk tales and their representatives, which we consider as belonging to the society and as an important element of the society, should be han-dled with care, and in this article, the place of Âşık Bayram Denizoğlu, one of the living minstrels, in the tradition of storytelling has been tried to be revealed. The story of Âşık Şemirhan and Âşık İbrahim compiled by us was brought to Turkish culture for the first time. Study: It consists of "Introduction, Life and Art of Âşık Bayram Denizoğlu, Place of Âşık Bayram Denizoğlu in the Folk Storytelling Tradition, Conclusion and Attachments". In our study, the importance of Âşık Bayram Denizoğlu has been mentioned in terms of keeping this tradition alive at a time when we think that the tradition of telling and creating stories has weakened. Then, traces of the formation process of a folk tale that has not been emphasized much will be given, and the use of traditional codes by the minstrel will be revealed. Even though our minstrel, who has thirty stories that he has created, uses traditional codes, the existence of these stories that he has recently created with his own knowledge and imagination will show that the folk poet strongly represents the folktale tradition

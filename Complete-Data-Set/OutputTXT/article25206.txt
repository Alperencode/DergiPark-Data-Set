Makale Başlığı: A Novel  Integrated Approach of Energy Consumption Scheduling in Smart Grid Environment With the Penetration of Renewable Energy
Özet: In the future era, Smart grid provides  phenomenal solutions for the consumers, in order for them  to use the energy in more easy and efficient method. In this work, a new demand side management scheme is proposed for users with renewable sources and storage facilities. Here an optimal scheduling for home appliances is determined using stochastic dynamic programming for consumers with smart meters. Simulation results demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach with the mathematical model. Results are worked out in Generic Algebraic Modeling system (GAMS) with Gurobi optimizer as a solver  which exhibits significant reduction of the electricity bills for the users with the usage of renewable energy  and battery storage.

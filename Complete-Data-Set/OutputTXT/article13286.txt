Makale Başlığı: Cross-cultural comparison of word associations in Kyrgyz and Russian
Özet: The concept of association, which can be explained as a situation where an emotion, thought or image in the mind brings to mind another, has a history of more than 2000 years. Since words have the function of meeting all feelings, thoughts or images, they have considered as the fundamental components of the concept of association, but the words have not arranged in alphabetical order in the mind as in dictionaries. In the sequence in the mind, the effect of each word’s own semantic ties, individual and social experiences, and world views (weltansicht) have seen. Therefore, the association networks of words have a dynamic structure that differs from individual to individual, culture to culture and period to period. In this study, the similarities and differences between the associations of some words in the Kirgizsko-Russkiy Assotsiativnıy Slovar' “Kyrgyz-Russian Association Dictionary” prepared by L. N. Titova in 1975 have been analyzed sociolinguistically.

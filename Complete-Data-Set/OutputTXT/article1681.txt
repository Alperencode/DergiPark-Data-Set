Makale Başlığı: Drone Attacks and the Principle of Proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict
Özet: Technology has developed significantly in the past few decades; obligations on belligerent parties, however, have not changed. One of these obligations is to respect the principle of proportionality while conducting attacks against lawful targets. For this reason, whilst military advantage can be gained through drone attacks, those attacks must not result in excessive harm inflicted upon civilian lives and properties. Also, belligerent parties should take all feasible precautions in order to minimize collateral damage and always take Human Rights Law into consideration even if the particular drone attack is lawful according to the Law of Armed Conflict.

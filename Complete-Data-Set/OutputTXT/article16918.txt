Makale Başlığı: A Real-Time Invoice Based Smart Meter Design with Mobile Application
Özet: The energy consumption issue has become one of the significant problems that are given great attention byThe governments, especially in the case of energy generation being less than required. It also has importance because of the rapid growth in the population and development and the dependence of millions of people on electric energy in their daily lives. In order to ensure the continuity of energy, it is necessary to regulate electricity consumption by providing the necessary real-time data to consumers. Currently, real-time data on energy consumption and information on the appropriate consumption time are not fully available for consumers. In addition, data is read manually at the end of each month to provide monthly invoices, a workforce is needed to complete this work, and errors occur due to human intervention. The proposed real-time invoice-based smart meter system is a measuring device to automatically read the data and provide the consumer with information on the energy consumed per hour, day, and month. The device helps the consumer choose the most suitable time for energy consumption and predicts the time when the amount of energy consumed exceeds the desired power.

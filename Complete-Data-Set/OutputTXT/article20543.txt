Makale Başlığı: A STUDY ABOUT DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT SKILLS SCALE IN THE PROCESS OF ONLINE COURSE IN PRIMARY SCHOOL
Özet: The aim of this study is to develop a "Scale of Online Classroom Management Skills for Primary School Teachers". Within this scope, five different models were established for the factor structure of the scale of "Classroom Management Skills in Synchronized Lesson in Primary School" and each model was tested with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to find the best model. The data of the study were collected from 352 teachers working in primary schools in Aksu, Kepez, Konyaaltı, Muratpaşa and Serik Antalya province in the fall semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. The item pool of the scale consists of 59 items. In order to evaluate the items, the opinions of 6 experts and 4 teachers from the fields of Classroom Management, Assessment and Evaluation and Classroom Education were taken. As a result of the feedback from the experts, some items were corrected and some were excluded from the scale. The item pool, which consisted of 59 items at the beginning, decreased to 38 items after these processes. CFA was used to provide statistical evidence for the validity of the scale. Cronbach Alpha value was calculated to test the reliability of the scale. As a result, the model of the Bi-factor structure showed a higher level of agreement compared to the other four models.

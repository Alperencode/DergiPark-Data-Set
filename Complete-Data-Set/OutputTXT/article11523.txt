Makale Başlığı: A study on behavior and welfare characteristics of Holstein cattle in manure and sand beddings
Özet: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of manure and sand bedding use on some animal welfare and behavioral characteristics in Holstein cattle. A total of 110 Holstein dairy cattle were used as animal material in the study. Cows in the barn were formed in groups of bed types (manure and sand bedding) and placed in equal numbers in two compartments with a stall length of 125x250 cm and a walking area in each group. In the research, carpal and tarsal lesions of the joints, blood serum glucose, total protein, and triglyceride statistically no-significant differences between the groups in terms of the standing time, lying/resting time, the number of steps and standing/lying frequency behavior characteristics, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, cholesterol levels in terms of the differences between the groups found to be statistically significant (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001). Lying/resting time was determined as 689 minutes in the sand bedding group and 638 minutes in the manure bedding group. As a result, the use of manure or sand bedding in Holstein cows of carpal and tarsal lesions in the pubic region of the impurity states that did not have a significant impact on the welfare of the cows. However, the use of a bed of sand, the positive impact of manure on the basis of response to stress results better in the group of the bed is examined and it is concluded that in terms of types of characters both can be used in Holstein dairy cattle breeding.

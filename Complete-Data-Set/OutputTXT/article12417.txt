Makale Başlığı: A Qualitative Study on Mothers whose Babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit/ Yenidoğan Yoğun Bakım Ünitesinde Bebeği Olan Anneler Üzerine Nitel Bir Araştırma
Özet: We aimed to explore the feelings and thoughts of eastern Anatolian mothers whose newborns are hospitalized in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This research employed a descriptive hermeneutical phenomenology paradigm and used semi-structured interviews with ten mothers, in one public and one private hospital located in the city of Van (Eastern Anatolia/Turkey) in March 2016. We found the main categories as “relational resilience sources”, “destructive relational sources” and “the effects of both relational sources” according to the feelings and thoughts of mothers. While mothers have mostly had unpleasant feelings about their baby’s hospitalization newborn unit, pleasant feelings also have been revealed such as a sense of gratitude or optimism. Mothers in eastern culture can trigger element of “faith” and “environmental support” among “resources of resilience” when they face this kind of challenging issue.

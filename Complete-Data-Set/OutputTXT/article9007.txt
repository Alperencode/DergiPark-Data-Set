Makale Başlığı: Does Timing of Treatment Have an Effect on Survival in Ovarian Carcinoma?
Özet: Background and Purpose: Optimal cytoreduction (CRS) is the main treatment modality in epithelial ovarian cancer (OC). Inoperable OC at the time of diagnosis may become eligible for CRS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). We aimed to investigate the effect of the time between NACT-CRS and CRS-adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in OC patients.Materials and Methods: Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of sixty-nine patients with OC who underwent CRS after NACT between December 2009 and May 2020 were analyzed retrospectively.Results: The median age was 61.1, and the median overall survival (OS) was 75.8 months. The median time from the end of NACT to CRS was 6.53 weeks, and the median time from CRS to initiation of adjuvant therapy was 4.8 weeks. The mean OS was 123.4 months in patients with a NACT-CRS interval of 6.53 weeks or less, and it was 61.6 months in patients above this period (p>0.05). The OS was 75.7 months in patients with an interval between CRS and adjuvant therapy of 4.8 weeks or less and 55.1 months compared to those with 4.8 weeks or more (p>0.05). Conclusion: It was shown numerically, although not statistically significant, that a long time between NACT and CRS and CRS-adjuvant therapy had a negative effect on OS.

Makale Başlığı: The Evaluatıon of Importance of New Immunohistochemıcal Markers For The Dıagnosis and Dıfferentıal Dıagnosis of Mesenchymal Tumors
Özet: Objectives: The diagnosis of the mesenchymal neoplasms, due to their rarity and variations of their morphology, is challenging for even the most experienced pathologists. The aim of the study is to reevaluate the cases with previous diagnosis of sarcoma using newly found immunohistochemical markers and 2013 WHO classsification.  Material and Methods: 183 cases who were diagnosed to have soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities between 2000-2015 were reevaluated using 2013 WHO classification. The histopathologic specimens were analyzed with the new immunohistochemical markers (TLE1, MUC4, MDM2, CDK4, TFE3, STAT6, INI1). The morphologic features and the ultimate diagnosis were compared with the previous histopathologic evaluation.  Results: The diagnosis was changed in 38 cases in this series after the application of the new immunohistochemical markers. The most remarkable alteration was detected in the groups of leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma. Conclusion: Soft tissue sarcomas exhibit difficulties during diagnosis even for experienced pathologists. This challenging process should be supported with the appropriate application of the immunohistochemical markers in order to decrease the rate of misdiagnosis. The careful examination with the newly developing immunohistochemical markers is required.

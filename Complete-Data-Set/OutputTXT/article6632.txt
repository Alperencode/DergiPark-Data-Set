Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Gastronomy Museums in the Sustainability of Local Food Products: The Case of Kars Zavot Eco-Museum
Özet: In this study, a study was conducted on Kars Zavot Eco-Museum by using semi-structured interview method in order to investigate the sustainability effect of gastronomy museums on local food products. Within the scope of the study, a total of 14 participants, including local administrators, academicians and museum founders living in Kars, were interviewed by phone for 30-45 minutes. Accordingly, while gastronomy museums contribute to the sustainability of local food products in general, the targeted effect in this field cannot be achieved due to the lack of promotion in the examples established in Turkey, the fact that the museums are not interesting, and there are obstacles such as lack of budget. It is thought that gastronomy museums will benefit the region in terms of economy, branding, awareness, sustainability and socio-cultural areas with applications such as showing the production of products, government support, and the use of social media. As a result of the study, it shows that Zavot Ecomuseum has an attractive role in the region, creates touristic activity and benefits the branding of the region. The results indicate that with the opening of the museum, forgotten products are started to be produced again, and the existing products are produced more, are known, their sales are increased and local food products are beneficial to be sustainable

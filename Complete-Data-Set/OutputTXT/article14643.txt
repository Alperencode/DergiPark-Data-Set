Makale Başlığı: Influence of 24-Epibrassinolide on Physiological Characteristics of Tomato Seedlings Infested with Root-knot Nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White, 1919) Chitwood, 1949 (Tylenchida: Meloidogynidae)
Özet: The aim of this research is to determine the physiological responses of tomato seedlings treated with 24-epibrassinolide (EBL), given via different methods such as immersion, irrigation, and foliar spray, followed by inoculation of root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White 1919) Chitwood, 1949 (Tylenchida: Meloidogynidae). Physiological measurements (chlorophyll, flavonols, nitrogen balance index, and anthocyanins) were carried out non-destructively with a portable chlorophyll meter at the end of the 56th days post inoculation. Results showed that chlorophyll contents of the tomato leaves were affected by both the EBL applications and the methods. Chlorophyll contents were better protected with the irrigation method. Flavonols and nitrogen balance index were inversely related with the application method. Leaf anthocyanin index was affected just by the EBL applications. Depending on the physiological aspect under observation, the method (immersion against irrigation, for instance) might present a challenging status in terms of providing protection against root-knot nematode when tomato plants are treated with EBL.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Anti-Inflammatory Impact of Vitamin D on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Endometriosis
Özet: Objective: Although numerous studies demonstrate the link between vitamin D and its anti-inflammatory effects, the correlations could not be fully explained. Platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are investigated as biomarkers for diagnosis and follow-up in various obstetrics and gynecological studies. We aimed to evaluate the correlation between the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D and inflammatory parameters NLR and PLR in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis.Materials and Methods: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, complete blood count (CBC) parameters, NLR, PLR, Vitamin B12, and  thyroid  stimulating  hormone  (TSH)  levels  of  140  patients  who  applied  to  the  Department  of  Obstetrics  and  Gynecology  between  2010-2019 were evaluated. In our study, the levels of 25(OH)D, TSH, vitamin B12 and CBC measurements were analyzed simultaneously. SPSS 22.0 Windows version software was utilized in the data analysis, and p<0.05 was accepted as statistical significance level.Results: There were significant differences in NLR (p=0.026) and lymphocytes count between PCOS and endometriosis groups (p=0.010). When we examined PCOS and endometriosis patients as a patient group; according to 25(OH)D vitamin levels, we found that NLR was significantly higher in the group with 25(OH)D vitamin levels below 20 ng/ml (p=0.017), vit B12 levels were significantly lower (p=0.034). Bivariate correlation analysis showed that vitamin D was negatively correlated with NLR (r=-0.196, p=0.050) in the patients with PCOS but not with endometriosis.Conclusion: This retrospective study assessed the association between vitamin D levels and the new inflammation biomarkers in patients with  PCOS  and  endometriosis.  The  CBC  and  neutrophil/lymphocyte  ratios  are  accessible  and  easily  measurable  biomarkers,  therefore,  evaluating the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D together with NLR is valuable for both PCOS and endometriosis.

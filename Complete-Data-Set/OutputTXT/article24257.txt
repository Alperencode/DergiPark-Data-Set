Makale Başlığı: Osteoid Osteoma of the Pisiform: A Case Report
Özet: Osteoid osteoma is an uncommon benign bone-forming tumor of the musculoskeletal system but it is the most common primary bone tumor of the carpal region. However, only seven cases of its pisiform involvement have been described. We present a 19 year-old male patient with osteoid osteoma of the pisiform which initially could not be detected in any diagnostic study. The patient was treated with excision and curettage. In 1 year of follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic without recurrence. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0101This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

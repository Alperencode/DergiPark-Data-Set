Makale Başlığı: The Purchase, Construction and Delivery Process of the 1st Inonu and 2nd Inonu Submarines in the Shadow of a Power Struggle over the Turkish Navy
Özet: Founded over the ruins from the continuous wars since the Tripoli War, the newly established Republic of Turkey faced the necessity of setting up a navy, however modest, to cope with geopolitical threats inherited from the Ottoman Empire. The establishment of a new sea power required an urgent need for a naval armaments program, as well as a large-scale renovation and modernization of outdated warships that had long been idling in ports and lacked operational capability. In determining the content of this program, the rivalry between naval and land forces had manifested itself during the Ottoman Empire and recurred in the Republican Era. However, the army, which emerged victorious from the War of Independence, became the sole authority in the modernization of the armed forces and determined the naval program in accordance with their own needs. Thus, defended by the General Chief of Staff, Fevzi Pasha (Çakmak), the green light was given to a limited naval program, which consisted of coastal defense-oriented submarines and small ships, and was considered an extension of the army at sea. Ultimately, the 1st and 2nd İnonu submarines, which were built by the Feijenoord Shipyard in the Netherlands, were commissioned by the Turkish Navy through a German front company. Although this initiative was a remarkable breakthrough that comprised of the core of Turkish submarine force, it was the product of a land forces-oriented perspective in the big picture. In this study, the procurement, construction and delivery processes of the 1st and 2nd İnonu submarines are discussed in the context of the power struggle in the Navy.

Makale Başlığı: An examination of opinions of teacher candidates on a course enriched through gamification
Özet: Gamification in education is the use of game-based mechanisms, game aesthetics and game thinking to ensure student motivation and engagement, superior learning, and a behavioral change. This study was conducted to investigate the nature of the students’ opinions on gamification and on activities that were carried out to create a rich instructional environment through gamification with Scratch. This study was conducted as a qualitative case study. The sample consisted of 37 students (12 females and 25 males) who took the course during the spring semester. Data were collected from the students by using observation and interview forms. Findings of a content analysis showed that gamification significantly influenced the students’ motivation, participation and achievement. It created an enjoyable educational environment, and consequently, enriched academic achievement. Gamification can be used to transform educational contexts, especially the subjects that are problematic, difficult, and boring for students and avoided by students for due responsibility.

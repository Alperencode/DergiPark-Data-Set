Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Hypodontia Prevalence among 8-15 Years Old Children in Elazig Province, From the Eyes of Parents: A Qualitative Research
Özet: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the congenital tooth deficiencies in permanent teeth (except for the third molars) among 8-15 years old children in Elazig. For this purpose, the panoramic radiographs of 969 children (473 girls, 496 boys) who went to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry of Dentistry Faculty were retrospectively examined. The data obtained from the study were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Chi-square test and p <0.05 was considered significant. In the study, the prevalence of hypodontia was found to be 5% (4% in males and 5.9% in females), and there was no statistically significant difference by gender. The teeth with the most common missing were identified as the mandibular second premolar (53.2%), the maxillary lateral (18.7%), and the maxillary second premolar (16.8%), respectively. As a detailed and careful radiographic examination is very important for the diagnosis of congenitally missing teeth, the function and aesthetics of patients with hypodontia have been suggested to be regained with a multidisciplinary approach.

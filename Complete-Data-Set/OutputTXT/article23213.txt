Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Non-woven Cover and Seedling Techniques on Plant Growth and Bulb Yield of Onion
Özet: This study aims to determine the effect of different cultivation techniques on onion plant growth and bulb yield in harsh continental climates and the short vegetation period. Three onion varieties with different dry skin colors were used as plant material. The techniques tried were: direct seed sowing, covering with non-woven fabric after sowing of seeds, planting seedlings, and covering with non-woven fabric after planting seedlings. The study was carried out in open field conditions in the Kayseri province where located in the central Anatolia region for two years. As a result of the study, it was determined that the interaction effects of the cultivar x cultivation technique had a statistically significant effect on all measured parameters. Although germination and emergence were observed in all varieties in both cultivation techniques, which started with direct seed sowing, plant development remained weak. The bulb formation was observed in only one variety in cultivation with seed sowing. In both techniques with seedlings, all varieties formed bulbs. Seedling planting + use of cover material had a positive effect on both yield and quality criteria for the bulbs. When all the results are evaluated together, it is understood that although the degree of effectiveness varies depending on the cultivars, seedling planting is a very effective technique for onions production in these climate conditions.

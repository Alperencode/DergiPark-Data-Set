Makale Başlığı: Using Walnut Shell Based Activated Carbon for the Efficient Removal of Phosphate from Aqueous Solutions
Özet: In this study, walnut shell, which is abundant in Turkey and low-cost biomass waste, has been used for activated carbon production and phosphate removal from aqueous solutions with the produced activated carbon was investigated. ZnCl2 was used to prepare adsorbent by chemical activation method. Produced activated carbons were characterized by moisture content, ash content, iodine number, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The specific surface area was calculated as 415.433 m2/g from the isotherms using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. The effects of pH, adsorbent amount, agitation speed and temperature were investigated. Different adsorption isotherm models were applied. It was found that the Langmuir isotherm provided the best fit for the experimental data. In the pseudo- second order kinetic model, the values found theoretically (qe,cal) were very similar to those determined by experiments (qe,exp). The results showed that the adsorption of phosphate on the WSAC fits the pseudo- second order kinetic model. According to the thermodynamics analysis, phosphate adsorption on WSAC was endothermic under the studied conditions.

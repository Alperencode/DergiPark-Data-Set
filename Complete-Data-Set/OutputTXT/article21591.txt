Makale Başlığı: AGENCY IN ONLINE FOREIGN LANGUAGE LEARNING AMIDST THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK
Özet: The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak has forced a sudden transition from face-to-face learningto online learning in higher education. This circumstance challenges university students to be more selfdirectedin learning with relatively minimum assistance from their lecturers or peers. Therefore, it is becomingincreasingly important to conduct a study on the issue of learner agency which remains little explored. Thepresent study aimed at investigating the agency of first-year university students in online learning of Arabicas a foreign language. In particular, this study examines their intention, motivation, self-regulation and selfefficacyin online learning of Arabic delivered synchronously by using Google Meet and asynchronously byusing Edmodo. An exploratory research method was employed in the study with the participation of 76 firstyearuniversity students at an Islamic public university in Jakarta, Indonesia. Results of the study reveal thatfirst-year university students have a relatively high intention, motivation, self-regulation and self-efficacyin Arabic online learning. Looking these findings into more detail, however, the students seem to havelimited information and preparation to achieve their goals, are undermotivated to speak with native Arabicspeakers, have shallow learning commitments, and are less likely to believe their performance. One of thepractical implications that emerge from this study is to introduce first-year university students to a varietyof strategies for learning Arabic in more self-directed ways, and this may be supported by lecturers as to notonly delivering content but also promoting skills during their teaching practices.

Makale Başlığı: Assessment Beliefs and Practices of Language Teachers in Primary Education
Özet: The use of assessment, the process of collecting information on student  achievement and performance, has long been advocated so that learning cycles can  properly be planned; instruction can be adjusted during the course of learning, and  programs can be developed to enhance student learning. Shifting to a more  pedagogical conception, the assessment moves from source of information to an  inseparable part of teaching and learning. Theory and research propose that  especially formative assessment can play a critical role in adjusting teaching for  student learning because assessment for learning (formative assessment) provides  information to be used as feedback to adjust the teaching and learning activities in  which the students and teachers are engaged. This study aims to show primary  school teachers’ beliefs about formative assessment. Besides, the study reveals the  information about English language teachers’ real assessment practices in the  primary education context. Despite course requirements, teachers’ positive beliefs  and attitudes, the results of the study show that language teachers do not apply  formative assessment practices as required in the national curriculum. Instead of  using assessment formatively, they mostly use assessment for summative purposes

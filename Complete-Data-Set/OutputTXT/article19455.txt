Makale Başlığı: The Mediator Role of Person-Organization-Fit in the Relationship between Employees’s Job Crafting and Intention to Leave
Özet: The aim of the present study is to investigate the mediating role of person-organization-fit in the relationships between employee’s job crafting and intention to leave. In this direction, the effect of employee's job crafting behaviors and person-organization-fit on their intention to leave will be tested, as well as, the effect of employee's job crafting behaviors on the person-organiztion fit will be examined.Public and private sector employees working in Şırnak, were included in the research population. 429 data were obtained with the questionnaire method on a voluntary basis. According to the results, while the job crafting positively affects person-organization-fit, it negatively affects the intention to leave. Similarly, person-organization-fit negatively affects intention to leave. In addition, it has been determined that person-organization-fit has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between job crafting and turnover intention. Within the scope of this research, some suggestions can be given to managers to encourage their employees to exhibit job crafting behaviors, which play an important role in increasing person-organization-fit, improving negative results for organizations such as intention to leave, reinforcing positive organizational and personal outcomes and most importantly, which is considered as an important factor in gaining competitive advantage. Another important suggestion given to the managers is to adopt a supportive organizational culture in their organizations. In future studies, it may be suggested to examine the individual and organizational consequences of job crafting, taking into account individual, situational, organizational and motivational factors in order to examine the possible consequences of the concept of job crafting in more depth

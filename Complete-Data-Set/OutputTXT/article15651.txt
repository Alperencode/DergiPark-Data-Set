Makale Başlığı: Peer Bullying in Special Education: A Qualitative Study Based on Teachers' Opinions
Özet: Negative behaviors and attitudes towards individuals with disabilities have been observed since ancient times. It is seen that these negative behaviors and attitudes have decreased as a result of some changes in the understanding of education and the search for rights of the families of individuals with disabilities. Despite all these developments, these students still face bullying behavior. It is thought that knowing all aspects of bullying behaviors experienced by students with special needs will contribute to the prevention of peer bullying. The aim of this study is to examine the opinions of special education teachers about the peer bullying experienced by students with disabilities. 20 special education teachers participated in this research, which was designed according to the qualitative research approach. The data of the research were collected through interview form and questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed through descriptive analysis. As a result of the research, it has been seen that students with special needs frequently encounter bullying behaviors and they are generally in the role of victim in these behaviors. It is recommended to conduct informative studies on awareness, empathy, and behavior change for students who show normal development in combating bullying behaviors, their families and teachers.

It might be the language they speak, and that is not necessarily about their native languages, but about how they speak to each other. It might be a popular musical interest. Or it might be their motivations in life. The crucial thing here is to understand the differences and find the middle way to communicate with each generation.Brands and their communication strategies are significantly important because if a brand cannot be relevant to the new generation, it might cause a decrease in their loyalty rates and customer lifecycles.Therefore, it is important to know what the main differences of their target audiences from the generational aspect are for marketers. Does Generation Z still enjoy using Instagram? Do Millennials find branding activities on Instagram relevant? Why are they using Instagram?This study will be covering the main motivational differences between Generation Z and Millennials in Turkiye and their Instagram usage motives, and discuss it based on the results of a conducted survey.Brands might change in time, and there is nothing to be afraid of. Planning the change and finding the expected behaviour is important, but once related data is available, companies might plan the change in the most accurate way possible.

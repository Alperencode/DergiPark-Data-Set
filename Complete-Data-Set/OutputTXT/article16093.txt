Makale Başlığı: Behavioral, Emotional Problems and Fatigue in Adolescents After COVID-19 Infection: A Cross-Sectional Study
Özet: Objective: This study aimed to investigate behavioral, emotional problems and fatigue in adolescents after COVID-19 infection. Also, we examined relationships between baseline inflammation levels, fatigue, and the current behavioral and emotional problems of adolescents. Material and Methods: A total of 110 adolescents (56 boys, 50.9%, mean age 14.72 years) and their parents were included in the study. Psychiatric assessments of the adolescents were performed 7.31±2.35 months after discharge from hospital. Behavioral and emotional problems was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 6-18 parent-rated questionnaire. Results: We collected baseline inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). The proportions of adolescents that were in the clinical range in at least one behavioral and emotional domain were as follows: 44.5% in the entire sample, 35.7% in boys, and 53.7% in girls. Thought problems were the most common problems in the entire sample (25.5%). The rates of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were 33.6% and 16.4%, respectively. Somatic and attention symptoms were more frequent in females than in males. Inflammatory marker levels did not correlate with behavioral and emotional scores. Fatigue symptoms were determined in 36.4% of all adolescents. We found that somatic and attention problems are more common in fatigued adolescents. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that screening for behavioral, emotional problems, and fatigue in adolescents with COVID-19 infection is necessary. Future studies with a follow-up design are needed to determine whether a relationship exists between behavioral, emotional problems and baseline inflammation levels after COVID-19 infection.

Makale Başlığı: EPISTEMIC PATERNALISM  IN FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC
Özet: Paternalism, briefly, is the idea that in a social group, within a hierarchical system, the behavior or preferences of individuals or groups can be interfered with, without their explicit consent, in order to ensure their well-being or protect them from harm. Another type of paternalism, whose legitimacy has been discussed frequently in the history of political thought, is epistemic paternalism, Epistemic paternalism is interventions in the people’s cognitive spaces aiming to protect or save them from false belief, knowledge or understanding that may be resulted in harm to themselves or society, in order to bring them to true belief, knowledge or understanding. During the coronavirus epidemic, one of the problems that occupied the public authorities the most was the information epidemic, also known as the infodemic. In order to control the flow of misinformation or disinformation, public authorities have effectively used all mass media, especially information technologies. In this article, the practices of public authorities to combat infodemic during the pandemic are placed within the framework of epistemic paternalism and the issue is discussed from a critical perspective. In conclusion, it is argued that such intervention to continue without restricting freedom of expression is possible.

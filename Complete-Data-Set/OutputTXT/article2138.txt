Printing inks are applied in a very thin layer to the surface of the material on which they are printed and can have a thickness of 5 to 125 μm, depending on the type of printing system. The visual specifications of the ink depend on three main factors. These are its color, transparency and brilliance. All ink-related factors directly affect the technical properties and printability parameters of the ink. However, knowing what these technical terms mean is important and necessary for optimum use of ink and verbal and written technical communication between all stakeholders. In this study, Turkish explanations and uses of the words color, brightness, opacity, light fastness, stickiness, viscosity, which are the six basic terms of printing ink, are given by translating from Turkish sources, foreign dictionaries and technical books.

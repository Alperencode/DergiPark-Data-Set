Makale Başlığı: THE SENSE OF EQUALITY IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND ITS HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Özet: Human beings are born free and equal. This proposition becomes a postulate in constitutional democracies. It is not possible to discuss this. However, mentioned postulate has been the result of long struggles. The French Revolution, which is the subject of our study is one of the most important turning points in terms of equality. Because by that time, there was a sense of class-based equality. The non-privileged class was deprived of so many rights. On the other hand, while the privileged classes enjoyed all the advantages of living in society, they did not even pay taxes properly thanks to their exonerations. Almost the entire burden of society was on the non-privileged class. The French Revolution was raised against such an order and it annihilated class-based equality. In place of this, it brought equality before the law. As a result of this impact, understanding the French Revolution is essential to comprehend the sense of equality in our age. However, in order to comprehend the French Revolution, it is necessary to understand the historical experience behind it. For this reason, in our study, the sense of equality of the Revolution period will be discussed together with its historical background. This background will start from the Roman Empire, not the Feudal era. Because the Roman Empire is the source of so many practices in the Feudal era.

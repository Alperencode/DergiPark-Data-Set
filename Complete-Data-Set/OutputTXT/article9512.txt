Makale Başlığı: Design Proposal for a Protective Shelter to be Used in the Archaeological Excavation and Exhibition Phases of Housing Settlement and Mosaics of Myrleia
Özet: Information about the ancient city of Myrleia, which is of great importance for the history of Bithynia and Mudanya, is minimal since the ancient ruins are buried under olive groves and the written sources about its construction in the ancient period are scarce. However, along with the ruins unearthed in 2015 and 2016, information about the ancient period of the city began to emerge. Therefore, it is essential to preserve the unearthed remains and their information and transfer them to the future in-situ, within the architectural and cultural context.Within the scope of the study, a protective shelter design proposal is developed on the residential settlement discovered in Ömerbey District in 2016 and the mosaics discovered in the settlement. The designed shelter aims to protect the remains from various adverse effects, provide the team’s comfort carrying out the study (thermal, security, etc.), and fulfill the functions of providing ideal conditions for the visitors. In addition, the sustainability of the top shelter and its flexibility to expand to include new finds discovered around the excavation area also played a significant role in the shelter design.

Makale Başlığı: Classification of rocks in Manisa-Gürle village region and investigation of their usability as concrete aggregate
Özet: Concrete, one of the most widely used building materials in building construction today; cement, water, aggregate and additives are obtained by ensuring the appropriate ratio optimization. The physical, chemical, mineralogical and especially mechanical properties of concrete are at the desired level in terms of the strength and durability of the constructed structures. In this direction, the choice of aggregates, which are an important part of the concrete mix, is one of the important factors affecting the concrete properties. The use of limestone and dolomitic rocks, which are among the rocks of sedimentary origin, in the selection of aggregates ensures that the adherence of the aggregate with cement is strong. In this study, it was aimed to identify and classify the rocks in the Manisa-Gürle village region and to investigate the suitability of their use as aggregates in concrete. In this context, after determining the physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of aggregate samples, 18 concrete samples were prepared using washed and unwashed aggregates and concrete compressive strength was tested at the end of 7, 14 and 28 days. As a result of the study, it was determined that the rock examined was included in the dolomitic limestone class and that it was appropriate to use dolomitic limestone aggregates in concrete construction. In addition, it has been determined that the use of washed aggregates increases the compressive strength of concrete compared to the use of unwashed aggregates.

Makale Başlığı: Standard precipitation index estimation with deep neural network model
Özet: Drought is a natural disaster that directly affects life and has a wide variety of negative effects. Different drought indices are used to predict drought. One of the most widely used of these indices is the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this study, the 3, 6, 9 and 12-month SPI data of Rize, Konya and Şanlıurfa provinces of Turkey were estimated 1-3 forward time. Deep Neural Networks models consisting of Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Networks (biLSTM) have been developed to perform the prediction study. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Correlation Coefficient, R and Determination Coefficient (R2) parameters were used to evaluate the forecasting performance. When the results obtained are evaluated with the performance parameters and scatter plots, it has been shown that the performance of the deep neural network model with biLSTM is quite good and that high correlation results can be obtained even in 3 forward-time predictions.

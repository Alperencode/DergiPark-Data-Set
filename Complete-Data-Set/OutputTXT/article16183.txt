Özet: The most accepted characteristic of Urfa in terms of religion is that it is the "City of Prophets". The prophet the city is most identified among the prophets is Prophet Abraham. İt is extremely important to reveal the connection of the Urfa region with the family of Prophet Abraham (PBUH), based on scientific data. Such a study will reveal how true the belief among the people and the information contained in the notes of the travelers are.No clear name for this region in the context of Prophet Abraham's family is stated in the Koran. However, there are some details in the Torah and the Bible. If, this information is interpreted by considering archaeological data, historical information and scientific disciplines, the subject becomes clear. Accordingly, Prophet Abraham and his family have a very close relationship between Urfa, Harran, Suruç and 'Aynu'l-' Arus, which was formerly a part of Harran. His father, paternal and maternal uncles lived in this region. Prophet Abraham's birth, thrown into the fire and his first marriage took place here, his migration started from this region. His son Ishaq and his grandson Jacob's bonds with the region have continued through his relatives-in-law.

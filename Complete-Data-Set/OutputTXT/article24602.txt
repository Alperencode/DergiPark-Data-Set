Özet: Disaster is a natural, technological and human-based phenomenon that requires the coordination of many institutions and organisations and causes physical, economic and social losses for human rights, interrupts normal life and human activities. Biological disasters are situations caused by organic origin or biological carriers. These biological carriers can be disease-bearing microorganisms, toxins, and bioactive products. When this situations occur, many deaths can occur, as well as injuries, illness or health problems. Moreover, these biological factors can turn into agricultural production losses, pasture-grazing diseases, social and economic breakdowns or even an environmental disaster depending on the type. The emergence of all kinds of negative effects of pesticides, the abundance of natural enemies that can be exploited in nature and the increase of environmental awareness should be the reasons for focusing on an environmentally friendly, sustainable and cheap control method such as Biological Control. Entomopathogens used in biological control against insects include bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa and nematodes. In terms of biological disasters, insect infestation and epidemic diseases stand out among this group. The most important biological disasters are disasters caused by microorganisms, and COVID-19, which the whole world is trying to deal with today, is a global biological disaster. The epidemic started in Wuhan / China in late 2019 and is now spreading all over the world.

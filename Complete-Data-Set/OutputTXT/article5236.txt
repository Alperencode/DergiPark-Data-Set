Makale Başlığı: Relationship of Concentrations of Some Heavy Metals with Fish Size in Muscle Tissue of Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) from the Tigris River (Turkey)
Özet: The levels of some heavy metals in muscle tissues (As, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Cd) of Carassius gibelio collected from the Tigris River were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS). All the metals in fish muscle were determined. The highest metal concentration in the muscle tissue was found to be Cu and the lowest Co. In regard to heavy metal levels and fish size there were remarkable positive and negative relationships. There was no gender differences in terms of heavy metal accumulation in muscle tissues of Carassius gibelio (p>0.05). The obtained results in this study were lower than the limits for fish which were proposed by WHO, FAO, EPA and TFC.

Makale Başlığı: Structural Features of Sheep Farms in Elazığ Province
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the structural characteristics of sheep farms in Elazığ province. For this purpose, 167 farms were included in the research and visited, evaluated on-site, and a face-to-face survey was conducted with their owners. According the study, 56.3% of the breeders owned their own land, 60.0% owned 10.1-50 decares of land, 86.2% of the barns were detached, 10.8% were adjacent to the house, 88.0% were closed type, 42.5% were on the north-south long axis, 60.0% were brick-briquettes walled, 66.9% were soil ground, 62.9% had adequate ventilation shafts, 84.5% had sufficient windows. In addition, 94.5% of the farms use troughs as sheep irrigation equipment, 55.8% prefer wooden mangers, 76.6% of the farms had two barn doors, 86.2% had 1 m2 or less walking area per sheep. But there was no feed mill/mixer in 88.5% and no shade/porch in 47.2%. As a result, it is expected that the sheep breeding in the province will reach the desired level by considering the identified problems and proposed solutions through this study by both the breeders and the relevant institutions and organizations. It is recommended to increase incentives, support and interest-free loans in order to eliminate structural problems in businesses.

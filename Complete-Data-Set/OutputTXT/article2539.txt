Makale Başlığı: The Turkish Adaptation of the Teaching Style for Successful Intelligence Questionnaire (TSI-Q): Validity and Reliability Study
Özet: The purpose of this research is to adapt the Teaching Style for Successful Intelligence Questionnaire (TSI-Q) developed by Paloş and Maricutoui (2006) to Turkish. The research was carried out on three separate groups consisting of 305 high school teachers. In the linguistic equivalence study, it was obtained that there were strong, positive, and significant correlations between responses of the participants to the English and Turkish forms of the scale. The construct validity of the TSI-Q’s Turkish form was tested by means of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). According to the results of EFA, a four-factor structure explaining 61% of the total variance was parallel to the original form of the scale. The fit indices reported in CFA were ratified in this four-factor structure. The emerging factors were named as memory, analytical thinking, reproductive thinking, and practical thinking as in the original form of the scale. Within the scope of the reliability, Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient of the TSI-Q was detected as .95. The item analysis result revealed that item-total correlations were over the threshold value of .30. All these results suggest that the Turkish form of the TSI-Q provides valid and reliable measurements, and it can be used to measure teaching style based on the successful intelligence of teachers.

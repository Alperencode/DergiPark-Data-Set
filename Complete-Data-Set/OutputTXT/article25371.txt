Makale Başlığı: Transcriptomic Analysis of Yarrowia lipolytica YlNTH1 and YlTPS1 Genes Under Different Carbon Sources
Özet: The biosynthesis of trehalose is catalyzed by synthase enzyme complexand degraded by neutral trehalase enzyme. Yarrowia lipolytica is a dimorphic yeast and used as a modelorganism for understanding the lipid metabolism of higher eukaryotes. YlTPS1 and YlNTH1 genes are responsiblefrom the recycling of trehalose in Y. lipolytica. The aim of this work is to determine theexpression patterns of YlTPS1 and YlNTH1 genesunder different carbon sources by using RNAseq study. Thefiles used in this analysis were obtained from the EMBL-EBI data bank and Study ID is “PRJEB2863”. Thesubstrates used in the work are Alkane, Glucose, Glycerol, Oleic Acid,Tributyrin and Triolein. The run accession numbers of substrates are ERR073010,ERR073011, ERR073009, ERR073008, ERR073012 and ERR073007, respectively."Trimmomatic" tool was used for croping the readings in the nextgeneration sequencing files. Reference genome of Y. lipolytica were obtained from Ensembl genome data base. Thefiles were converted to “ERR0730xx_tophat2.bam” files and used in the"FeatureCounts" tool. We found that the transcript level of YlTPS1 gene was 2 to 4 times higher thanYlNTH1 gene. The rate of trehalose synthesisis greater than the rate of breakdown in Y.lipolytica yeast cells.

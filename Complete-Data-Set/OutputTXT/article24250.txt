Makale Başlığı: Pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery caused by a guide wire following femur intertrochanteric fracture with a hip nail: A case report
Özet: An 85-year-old woman developed severe swelling and pain in the proximal thigh after internal fixation of an intertrochanteric fracture of the femur with a hip nail. In order to identify the causes and determine the effective treatment, angiography was performed. The results of the angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of a branch of deep femoral artery. Endovascular embolization was used to treat the pseudoaneurysm. After reviewing all possible causes, we found a mistake in insertion of a guide wire for hip nail. Using intraoperative fluoroscopic images, we found the mal-positioned guide wire located posterior to trochanter on lateral view of hip. This case study reminds us that pseudoaneurysm can occur in a guide wire during hip nailing. Surgeons can avoid this complication with confirmation of lateral and anteroposterior view of hip. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0071This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: Detection of Active Fires with Sentinel-3 Data and Their Verification through the use of Sentinel-2 Data
Özet: The increase in forest fires worldwide as a result of global warming has recently been felt clearly in our country as well. This increase necessitated the activities to detect, monitor and control such incidents in the earliest way, to be carried out quickly, organized and correctly.  There are different methods for detecting and monitoring forest fires at an early stage. Using satellite remote sensing data is one of these methods and valuable data can be obtained for fire detection through payloads placed on different satellites in low or geosynchronous orbit. In this study, in order to monitor forest fires and determine the area damaged by the fire, the forest fire that resulted in the burning of a huge area in Manavgat district of Antalya province in 2021 was examined using Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-3A data. As a result of the study, it has been seen that satellites provide valuable information in the monitoring of forest fires and it has been pointed out that the design of our next-generation satellites in geosynchronous orbit, in a way that will provide data for fire detection and monitoring will facilitate the follow-up of forest fires that will occur in our country.

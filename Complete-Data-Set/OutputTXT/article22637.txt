Makale Başlığı: THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF QIRAAT DIFFERENCES UPON UNDERSTANDING THE STORY OF AṢḤĀB AL KAHF IN SURAT KAHF
Özet: In making sense of the Qur'an, commentators try to consider different factors involved in understanding and interpreting its verses. Many of these commentators take the differences in qiraat (recitation of the Holy Quran) into account besides other factors in deciphering the message of the Holy Book. Differences observed in qiraat are historically attributed to authentic narrations. No competent commentator would remain indifferent to the qiraats that have been handed down through such narrations. The story of Aṣḥāb al-Kahf (People of the Cave) is mentioned in verses 9-26 of Surat Kahf. Different sources have made different interpretations about where and when this story took place, how many young people sought refuge in this cave, and what they experienced upon waking up from a centuries-long sleep. This Surat has rich content in terms of qiraat differences. The present study focuses on the effect of three different qiraats of upon meaning and its positive contributions to understanding the story of Aṣḥāb al-Kahf.

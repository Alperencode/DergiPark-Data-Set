Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Decisions Civil Court on the Criminal  Judgment in the Context of Comporative Law Turkey  and Azerbaijan Case
Özet: There is no regulation in Turkish law that fully solves the effect of civil judgment on criminal cases. This deficiency was tried to be solved by the doctrine views and the Supreme Court applications. When a court dismisses a claim because of prejudice it means that the plaintiff cannot refile the same claim again in the courts. The courts dismiss same claim and the plaintiff is barred from bringing that claim in a court. So same claim will be prevented subsequent refilling. The reason that same claim has been prevented subsequent refilling is because first judgment is considered an adjudication on the merits. It is accepted in the doctrine that, when an action is related to criminal and civil cases the civil judgment will affect on criminal case. In our opinion, every issue affecting the criminal responsibility of the accused should be investigated ex officio during the criminal procedure.

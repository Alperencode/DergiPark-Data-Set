Makale Başlığı: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use and evaluation of patient characteristics: A single center experience
Özet: Objective: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is often used in individuals with nutritional problems and in need of long-term tube feeding. The aim of this study was to determine the changes in the use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and patient characteristics, and the changes in some biochemical markers before and after the PEG procedure, and whether it is significant or not. Method: The data of 170 patients who underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in our center between August 2014 and August 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Glucose, urea, creatinine, alt, ggt, albumin, calcium, magnesium, crp, wbc, hb, plt, ınr values of 170 patients were compared, and in the analysis of variables SPSS program used. Results: The 170 patients included in the study were 52.3% female and 47.7% male. The median age of the patients was 72 years (minimum: 17 years, maximum: 104 years). Starting from 2014, the number of patients who received PEG was 14, 20, 22, 25, 44, 45 respectively, by years until 2019 (p = 0.03).A statistically significant increase was observed in the frequency of PEG opening by years. PEG indication of the patients was evaluated and cerebrovascular event (CVE) was the most common cause per year, n: 76 (44. 6%).Other PEG indications were malignancies n: 29 (17%),hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy n:17 (10%).The average length of stay in the hospital was 11. 3 days after PEG was opened (Table 1). The values checked before and after PEG There was a statistically significant change in urea, creatinine and magnesium values (p <0.05).There was no statistically significant change in the other values.Conclusion: In this study, we examined the use of PEG, which has changed over the years in our clinic, and patient characteristics. PEG is a safe method in geriatric patients, and it positively affects some biochemical markers in patients.

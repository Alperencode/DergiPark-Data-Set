Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the three values that elementary school teachers prioritize and to examine them in terms of their demographic characteristics. The research has been carried out with elementary school teachers actively working in the city center, Isparta. Data have been collected from 165 classroom teachers with the appropriate sampling method, on a voluntary basis. The data have been obtained through the "Prioritized Values Questionnaire" which has been created by the researcher. All the data collected have been analyzed with the SPSS program. The first three values that elementary school teachers prioritize have been determined as justice, honesty and respect. The first three values have been examined in terms of gender, age, seniority, education level and the type of school graduated. In the analysis having been made, no significant difference has been found in the first three values in terms of gender. A significant difference has been found in the value of respect in terms of age and seniority, in the value of justice in terms of education level and in the value of honesty in terms of the type of school graduated.

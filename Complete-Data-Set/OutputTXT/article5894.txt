Makale Başlığı: The Relations of Dubays b. Sadaḳa, the Adventurer Amīr of Ḥilla, with the Irāḳ Saldjūḳid Sultans, the ʿAbbāsid Caliphate and the Great Saldjūḳid Ruler Between 1132-1135
Özet: Dubays b. Sadaḳa was an Arab amīr who wanted to increase the authority of his dynastyMazyadids in central ʿIrāḳ, especially in Ḥilla. As a result, he conflicted with boththe ʿAbbāsid Caliphate and the ʿIrāḳ Saldjūḳ State because of his interests in the regionand he often confronted them. Sometimes he tried to take advantage of the weaknessof the ʿAbbāsid caliphs; sometimes the struggle for the throne among the members ofthe ʿIrāḳ Saldjūḳid dynasty gave Dubays the opportunity he was looking for. However,although Dubays b. Sadaḳa tried to take advantage of every opportunity that came hisway, he couldn’t achieve the success he desired. When he was unsuccessful, he had toflee from the region and took refuge in the surrounding dominant forces, and not onlyDubays but also his dynasty went through hard times. In addition, his looting and plunderingactivities hurt both the ʿAbbāsids and the ʿIrāḳ Saldjūḳids and left the public in adifficult position. Eventually Dubays b. Sadaḳa undeniably became one of the amīrs whowas always feared. In this research, which is a continuation of the article examining therelations of the aforementioned amīr with the Saldjūḳs in the West and the East, as well asthe ʿAbbāsids, the role of the Dubays b. Sadaḳa in the events that took place between theyears 1132-1135 in the triangle of the Great Saldjūḳ ruler, ʿAbbāsid Caliphate and ʿIrāḳSaldjūḳids will be evaluated in the light of the information in the sources.

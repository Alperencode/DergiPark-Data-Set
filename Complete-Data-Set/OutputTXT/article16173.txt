Özet: In this study, the relationships between pet ownership and religiosity in Turkey were examined. While doing this, questions were asked to obtain information about the status of animal ownership during and before the pandemic period covering 2020 and 2021. In the study, besides the animal ownership behavior, attitudes and behaviors towards stray animals were also discussed. Questions were also asked to reveal attitudes towards the consumption of animal food and animal sacrifice, which constitute tensions in religion and animal treatment. For this purpose, a questionnaire and a religiosity scale were used to obtain information about the general tendencies towards pet ownership and the behaviors in this period. The obtained data were subjected to various tests by means of the SPSS program. As a result, it was observed that there was no differentiation according to the state of religiosity in animal ownership before and during the epidemic. However, it has been observed that there may be differences according to different variables other than religiosity. It has also been found that there is no difference in the treatment of stray animals according to the religious attitude, but there are differences in the consumption of animal food and animal sacrifice according to the level of religiosity.

Makale Başlığı: Guidance Services Carried Out by Tatars in The Ottoman Empire in The Notes of 19th Century British Travelers
Özet: Many travelers from the Western world, especially from Europe, came to the Ottoman lands in the 19th century, made various observations and analyzes, noted them down and later published them in a book. Travelers are sometimes an adventurer who desires to know geographies and communities far from their countries or a merchant pursuing his interests in the attractive markets of Asia, sometimes a missionary who takes it upon himself to convey the divine message to all humanity, and sometimes an orientalist trying to gather knowledge from the science and art of the rich Eastern civilization, and sometimes they were in the Ottoman lands with the identity of a diplomat to represent their countries. The details of these extremely difficult journeys that the travelers made between the geographies they encountered for the first time, the languages and cultures they were unfamiliar with have been a matter of curiosity.This curiosity also forces the readers of the travelogue to think about the individual and institutional guidance services received by travelers who make mysterious and dangerous journeys in Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Iran, the Caucasus and Asia. In this study, the guidance services carried out by Tatars in the Ottoman lands, based on the travel notes of some British travelers, are discussed. In this context, the institutional framework of the guidance services, its functioning, wage policy, road preparations, accommodation and food and beverage opportunities offered in the menzilhane, clothing of Tatars and character analyzes were included. Thus, in particular, the introduction of the guidance services received by foreign travelers along the way in the Ottoman lands is aimed, in general, making a modest contribution to the history of Ottoman transportation and communication.

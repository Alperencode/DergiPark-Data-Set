Makale Başlığı: The Sociology of Masks: From Face-to-Face to Mask-to-Mask Communication
Özet: In addition to their function as a health measure, masks have become a sign and symbol during the Covid 19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to reveal the transformation of masks into sociological symbols in fields such as social category, identity, rites of passage, and aesthetics within the framework of the virus-induced social change in addition to its role as a health measure. Different from other body-protecting gears in daily life, masks cover the face. The face is the primary area of communication for humans. Interactions in society inevitably take on different forms for us to express ourselves. Covering the human face, masks have become reflections of people’s true desires, thus turning into boards of disclosure. White masks are now replaced by colorful masks flaunting a variety of symbols from cartoon characters for children to symbols of political goals of certain political actors, the expression of identity, aesthetic satisfaction, and names of celebrities; in short, they have transformed into social symbols. The examples given in this research provide evidence for the transformation of masks into a “disclosure board” by turning into tools of social interaction in addition to their role as a health measure.

Makale Başlığı: The effects of different sowing density and harvest periods on dry matter yield and some quality traits of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)
Özet: Objective: This study was carried out to determine the dry matter yield and some quality characteristics of safflower at different planting densities and development stages. Materials and Methods: The research was carried out in Usak in 2021 with three replications according to the factorial experimental design in randomized blocks. In the study, safflower was grown at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 plants m-2 planting densities and was harvested in 3 different development stages in bud removal, beginning of flowering and full flowering stage.  The plant height, green grass yield, dry matter yield, crude protein rate, crude protein yield, NDF, and ADF rates of safflower were determined. Results: According to the results obtained from the research, depending on the applications, the plant height varied 72.35-77.67 cm, fresh herbage yield 1333.54-2001.87 kg/da, dry matter ratio 16.53-40.73%, dry matter yield 303.72-585.86 kg/da, crude protein ratio 8.36-12.29%, crude protein yield 37.40-55.23 kg/da, NDF ratio 31.30-47.92%, and ADF ratio between 27.61-38.59%. While increasing plant density in the study increased the yield of fresh herbage, dry matter, and crude protein yield, it caused a decrease in quality characteristics with the advancing harvest stage. Conclusion: At the end of the study, it was concluded that for the high yield and quality in safflower grown for roughage, it is more suitable to be sown at 90 plant m-2 sowing density, and the harvest made at the beginning of flowering. But it is appropriate to experiment for at least one more year.

Makale Başlığı: THE CONCEPT OF “INDUSTRIAL DESTINATION” AND DESTINATION STUDIES IN INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT IN THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Özet: In this research, it is aimed to develop a measurement tool that measures industry destination requirements. In the research, a data collection tool consisting of two parts, company general information and Industry Destination Elements Requirement Scale (SDUGÖ), was used as data collection tool. In the research, a survey was conducted on 116 local and 33 foreign-based company employees. According to the results of the analysis, the input dimension explains 29.38% of the total variance, the process dimension 7.52%, the product dimension 7.03%, and the marketing/management dimension 5.66%. The total internal consistency coefficient of the items in the scale is 0.656, which is above the 0.60 level accepted in the literature. The results of the KMO sample adequacy test showed that the number of questionnaires for the scale was sufficient, and the KMO value was above 0.50. Barlett Test results also show that Principal Components Analysis results are usable. The corrected item-total correlations are also at an acceptable level, and all items of the scale dimension are suitable for use. The whole scale explains 49.59% of the total variance. The scores given to all elements are higher in the domestic sample. According to the results of the difference analysis, the differences between the process, product and marketing/management scores are statistically significant (p<0.05).

Makale Başlığı: The terms related to horse and equestrıanısm ın Esb-Name as a horse-leechery book
Özet: In order to reveal and to evaluate the terms related to horse and equestrianism in Alḭ el-Maġribḭ's Esb-nāme the copy of the aforementioned work in the Süleymaniye Library was examined.The work written in the Arabic alphabet was translated into the Latin-based Turkish alphabet and analyzed. The terms related to horse and equestrian in this work have been determined and given as a short dictionary. Veterinary notes are important works not only in terms of veterinary history, but also in terms of language and culture.The process of creating Turkish horse and equestrianism terminology will be possible by comparing the terms related to horse and equestrianism in the works written in historical periods in detail.Esb-nāme, in terms of content, is a work that will shed light on the history of Turkish language and culture and contribute to the vocabulary related to horses and equestrianism.This study consists of three parts : introduction, dictionary and conclusion.

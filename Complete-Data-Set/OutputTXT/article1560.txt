Makale Başlığı: ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY AND ANTI-CANCER EFFECTS OF BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTILLUS L.) FRUIT EXTRACT ON GASTRIC CANCER, AGS CELL LINE
Özet: Objective: Vaccinium myrtillus L. fruits are consumed as food. This research was aimed to evaluate V. myrtillus methanol extract antioxidant and cytotoxic activities and determine its anti-cancer potential to further study against gastric cancer.        Material and Method: V. myrtillus fruit (Bilberry) methanol extract was examined for its antioxidant activities by ABTS•+ and DPPH• assays. The phytochemical analysis of the extract was studied by HPLC method. The cytotoxic effect of V. myrtillus fruit methanol extract on gastric cancer cell line AGS was measured by Cell Titer-Glo assay. Additionally, as healthy control, fibroblast like human mesenchymal stem cell line was used for testing anti-cancer efficacy.         Result and Discussion: V. myrtillus fruit methanol extract showed 0.1413 and 0.0439 mg/mL IC50 values as antioxidant activity by ABTS•+ and DPPH• assays, respectively. Malvidin-3-O-Glucoside was detected as an anthocyanin compound by HPLC method. Cytotoxicity analysis showed that among different concentrations (0.5-10 mg/ml), the most significantly, 2 mg/ml of Bilberry extract treatment decreased the viability of AGS gastric cancer cells while sparing healthy MSC cells. This data suggests the further analysis of Bilberry extract on several cancer cell lines as well as the determination of a potential active substance in the extract.

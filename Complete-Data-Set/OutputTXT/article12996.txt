Makale Başlığı: TRANSTEXTUALITY AND MISE EN ABYME IN MURAKAMI HARUKI’S KILLING COMMENDATORE
Özet: The aim of this study is to discuss Murakami Haruki’s novel Killing Commandatore (Kishidanchou Goroshi) in terms of transtextuality and analyze the allusions and intertextual references in Murakami’s narrative. This study argues Murakami’s novel Killing Commendatore adopting Gennette’s framework of transtextuality and his theory of metalepsis as well as utilizing the term “mise en abyme” which was characterized by André Gide. Killing Commendatore has considerable amount of intertextual relationships with Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni, Fitzgereald’s novel The Great Gatsby, Carrol’s novel Alice in Wonderland and Akinari’s story Fate over Two Generations and these intertextual bonds add complexity to the literary work while blurring the borderline with fiction and reality. The Commendatore in Don Giovanni Opera reveals itself in metadiegetic level both in the novel and the painting in the novel, creating metalleptic effect and this leads to the violation of the narrative boundaries.

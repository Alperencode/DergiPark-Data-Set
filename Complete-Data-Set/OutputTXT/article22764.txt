Makale Başlığı: Effects of Triclosan on Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Intestinal Histopathology
Özet: Triclosan, a type of bisphenol, is used as a preservative, antiseptic, antimicrobial and disinfectant in the structure of many products such as antibacterial soap, deodorant, toothpaste, hand cream, as well as personal care products such as fabrics, toys, toothbrush handles, and plastics used in the kitchen. Triclosan, which is one of the important biocides and environmental pollutants, mixes with the ecosystem through groundwater and threatens the life of aquatic organisms. In this study, it was aimed to examine the histopathological effects of triclosan on zebrafish intetinal tissues. Fish were treated with 34, 85 and 170 μg/L triclosan for 5 days. At the end of the 5-days of exposure period, the intestinal tissues were dissected. Tissues were fixed with Bouin's fixative for 24 hours, followed by routine histological techniques. Hematoxylin & Eosin staining was performed after 5 µm thick sections were taken from the tissues with a microtome. Stained sections were evaluated under a light microscope and histopathological changes were observed. While normal intestinal tissue was observed in the control group, degeneration in the villus structure, fusion of the villi, an increase in the number of enterocytes and lymphocytes due to inflammation, hyperplasia in the goblet cells and thickening of the muscularis externa were detected in the experimental groups.

Makale Başlığı: A Concept in Psychoanalysis “Identification”
Özet: Psychoanalysis is a theory that continues to be up to-date because of the explanations to personality development and mental health problems although many years have passed. One of the most important concepts of this theory is identification. Identification is a psychological process whereby the individual associates himself with other individuals and transforms their characteristics to his own personality. From infancy to every period of life, identification provides a basis for the individuals to be themselves and make their own life story. In particular, it is crucially important that therapists, psycological counselors, parents and teachers promote the child’s identification in supporting healthy personal development and community development for the next generations. In this study, the concept of identification is discussed and relevant literature review is presented. In this context, Freud’s and other theorists’ views on identification are included. The current study also evaluates the various influences of identification on the individual, the difference in idealization and its reflection on Freud. The concept of identification is discussed from an educational point of view, and relevant research studies, the role and importance of teachers are presented. This study furhter argues the effect and reflections of identification on psychoanalysis.

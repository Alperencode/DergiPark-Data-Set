Makale Başlığı: Polymicrobial peritonitis case in a patient who underwent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis result with exitus
Özet: Peritonitis is a common complication in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Majority of cases are usually due to a single agent. Besides, polymicrobial peritonitis develops in approximately 1-4% of patients. A gram-negative pathogen with another bacteria or fungus and rarely more than one gram- positive pathogen are responsible for this polymicrobial peritonitis. It is recommended to investigate intraabdominal focus in patients with polymicrobial peritonitis. In this article, we present a 29-year-old patient with chronic renal disease for 7 years who underwent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for the last 1 year and had polymicrobial peritonitis due to Serratia fonticola, Enterococcus faecium and Cryptococcus laurenti and resulted with exitus.

Makale Başlığı: Personal Data and Right to Privacy as a Limitation for Right to Receive Information
Özet: In this study, the right to information as an element of transparency, which is an inseparable part of the democratic state of law, and the privacy and protection of private life and personal data, which are exceptions to this right, are discussed. In the study, first of all, the concepts of knowledge, acquiring knowledge and access to information were introduced. Parallel to this, the right to information and freedom of information have been separated from each other and the differences between the two concepts in terms of terms and consequences have been taken into account. Then, our main subject, the right to information, and the privacy and protection of private life and personal data were examined; it has been revealed that the right to protect private life and personal data is one of the limits of the right to information.

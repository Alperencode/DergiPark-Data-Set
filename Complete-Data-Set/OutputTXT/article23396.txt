Makale Başlığı: Determination of some microbiological properties of commercial probiotic yogurts
Özet: In recent years, the production of functional foods is increasing day by day due to the increasing awareness of people about nutrition and their preference to healthier foods. Probiotic yogurts are one of the products produced to reveal the positive effects of probiotic microorganisms on health through scientific studies and to increase the rate of consumers' consumption of probiotic foods day by day. In this study, some microbiological properties of commercially produced probiotic yoghurts sold in Kırşehir were investigated. Total aerobic mesophilic, streptococci, lactobacilli and coliform bacteria counts of probiotic yogurt samples were analyzed. It has been determined that the bacterial counts of the examined yoghurts are in accordance with the Turkish Food Codex Communique on Fermented Dairy Products. It was concluded that the microbiological quality of the A coded sample was better than the B coded sample. The results obtained are in accordance with the probiotic food criteria in terms of the microorganism species examined.

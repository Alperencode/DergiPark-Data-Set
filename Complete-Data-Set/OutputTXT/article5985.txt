Makale Başlığı: Improving Ballistic Properties to Low Alloy Steel by Surfacing with Welding
Özet: While many methods were used in the development of armor materials, welding was preferred in this study. Although welding is a process that mainly used for the purpose of joining two parts, it has become one of the methods that directly affect and improve the properties of the parts today. Sufacing is a type of welding method that covering surface of worn or produced metal parts with hardfacing electrodes to increase wear resistance, service life or other properties. In this study, the properties of S355JR low alloy steel plate were increased by surfacing with E Fe 14 hardfacing electrodes and its ballistic performance and hardness properties were investigated. Electric arc welding (SMAW) was done manually with a 4 mm diameter Fe-Cr-C based covered electrodes. Welding process was done in the form of double pass, by rotating 90 degrees between layers. Chemical composisiton of the consumable increased the mechanical properties of the material in electric arc welding. For this reason, in this study, it is aimed to develop a replacement product for the armors used today while reducing weight, and to reuse these electrodes for repair purposes, since it is not possible to repair the armors after they are hit. After hardfacing, the hardness value increased approximately 8 times. In ballistic performance, it has absorbed the kinetic energy of the bullet at 820 m/s, which is suitable for protection at NATO STANAG III, EN 1522 FB7, VPAM 9 levels.

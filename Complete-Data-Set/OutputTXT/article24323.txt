Makale Başlığı: Turkey as a Nuclear State: A Hypothetical Study
Özet: One of the main security concerns in the Middle East which is considered as an unstable region is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proliferation of nuclear weapons which are the most dangerous of such weapons is an important security issue that should be considered not only for the region but also for the global sense. It is a matter of curious that in this conflict prone region, what kind of attitude the states or non-state actors might have if they obtain nuclear weapons that are extremely destructive and have a long term harmful effects in their use. In this study, if Turkey, an important actor in the Middle East Region, becomes a nuclear power, what kind of strategies she may pursue will be examined by using the methodology of scenario analysis. In the study, Turkey’s possible nuclear behaviors will be analyzed through the duruş optimizasyonu theory which is developed by nuclear strategist Viping Narang in order to understand the nuclear strategies of regional nuclear powers. The main research questions of the study will be such as: in today, if Turkey has had nuclear weapons, how she may behave? Which domestic and external factors might be effective in Turkey’s possible nuclear behaviors? In the study, firstly, the scenario analysis techniques will be examined as a methodology of hypothetical studies. Then, the duruş optimizasyonu theory will be explained. In the third section, through the duruş optimizasyonu theory, Turkey's possible nuclear strategy or strategies will be analyzed. In the final part of the study, the study will be concluded with a general evaluation

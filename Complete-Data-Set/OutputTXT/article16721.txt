Makale Başlığı: Aydaş Food Cooking Tradition Within The Context of Shamanistic Origin: The Case Uşak Province
Özet: The tradition of cooking aydas food, which is one of the ancient healing methods of the Turks, is still applied to children who are described as aydas in some regions of Anatolia and maintains its influence on the public to a great extent. One of the regions where this tradition continues to exist today is the province of Usak. It has been determined that there has not been a comprehensive study yet on the tradition of cooking aydas food in the province of Usak, which is one of the oldest settlements that has hosted many civilizations throughout history and where folk medicine is widely practiced. This situation prompted us to work on the aforementioned subject.Within the scope of the study, the concepts of aydas and aydasık, the reason for the emergence of aydasıklık as a disease, the origin of the tradition of the aydas food and its nature in Usak will be emphasized; The possible shamanistic basis of the symbiont, its connection with the cults, whether it can be accepted as a rite of passage will be questioned. The aim of the study is to try to understand the connection of some shamanistic elements of Central Asian Turkish culture with the tradition of aydas food, which is one of the folk healing practices seen in many parts of Anatolia today, in the sample of Usak province.

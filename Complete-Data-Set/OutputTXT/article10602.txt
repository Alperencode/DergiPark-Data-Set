Makale Başlığı: Developing a self-efficacy scale for life studies course
Özet: The goal of this research is to develop the Life Studies Course Self Efficacy Scale (LSCSS) and test its validity and reliability. This research is a scale development study. The participants in the study were 2nd and 3rd grade pupils from central districts of Diyarbakır province. The Self Efficacy Scale for Children and the Draft Form of the LSCSS were used to collect data. During the development of the scale, principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed. The scale's similar scale validity was tested using correlation analysis. The Corrected Item-Total Correlations of the items were calculated, and the mean scores of the lower and upper groups were compared using the Independent Samples t-Test to determine if the items were distinctive or not. Internal consistency, split-test, and test-retest methods were used to assess the reliability of the LSCSS measurements. The LSCSS can be utilized as a valid and reliable measurement tool to determine the self-efficacy levels of 2nd and 3rd-grade children for the life studies course, according to the findings of this study. The LSCSS consists of 15 items. This scale is a 5-point Likert scale, which means "never, seldom, sometimes, most of the time, and always". The LSCSS consists of two sub-scales: Authority Oriented Self Efficacy Scale (AOSS) and Individual Oriented Self Efficacy Scale (IOSS). Thanks to the LSCSS, numerous more investigations are expected to be done in the future.

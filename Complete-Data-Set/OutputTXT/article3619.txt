Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Catch Efficiency of Nets with Multifilament and Monofilament Materials in Çanakkale Coasts
Özet: In this study, catch efficiencies of monofilament and multifilament gillnets used in red mullet (Mullus sp) fisheries on the coasts of Çanakkale region in the North Aegean Sea were compared. The trials were carried out between October 2019 and August 2021, at depths 2-30 m using multifilament (210d/2) and monofilament (0.18 mm ᴓ) gillnets with 18 - 20 - 22 mm mesh size. All fish species captured other than the target species of red mullets (Mullus surmuletus, Mullus barbatus) were considered as by-catch. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) of each gillnet (1 gillnet = 100 m long) was obtained by dividing the total number of individuals and total weight of each catch by the number of operations.  The total catch in terms of number and weight by monofilament gillnets were 2.21 and 2.02 fold higher than those caught by multifilament gillnets, respectively. The number and weight of the target catch caught by monofilament gillnets were 1.2 and 1.22 fold higher than those caught by multifilament gillnets, respectively. The number and weight of the by-catch caught by the monofilament nets were 2.48 and 2.31 fold higher than those caught by the multifilament gillnets. There were no statistical differences in the number and weight of the target catches between the multifilament and monofilament gillnets (P>0.05). The monofilament nets caught significantly higher catches in terms of number and weight than those caught by multifilament nets (P<0.05). The results of the study showed that monofilament nets should not be used in red mullet fisheries in areas where species diversity is high such as the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean.

Makale Başlığı: The Dream That The Early Republic Interpret Favourably:  Turkish Cinema between National and Contemporary Lines
Özet: Yakup Kadri, the lead author of Kadro magazine, who contributed to the formation of the ideology of the early republic, and one of the important names who produce works in different literary genres, speaks on behalf of the regime in many of his texts and expresses how the regime should be. After the proclamation of the Republic, Kadri writes about the culture and art life of the new regime, and describes the roles that art genres should gain with it in his works. Due to the conflict between the ideals of the Republic and the corruption encountered in the early republic, Yakup Kadri positions the play of the character named Neşet Sabit as a guide in his Ankara novel, which he wrote, and accordingly, he assigns the Turkish cinema, which was produced in a small number at that time, to the task of building the universe he desires in the novel. Cinema is seen as a tool that will pioneer a new understanding in a newly established city, increase its utopian role from the feared future in Sodom and Gomorrah to a hopeful dawn of a painful night that it wishes to be in the Ankara novel. Cinema is seen as a contemporary utopia, as well as a domestic content. In this study, it is tried to determine the missionary approach to cinema of the early republican period through Yakup Kadri's Ankara novel by using discourse analysis. It is seen in the novel and in Kadro magazine that it is located next to the theater in the construction of a desired republic utopia through modernity, new regime, and national cinema codes.

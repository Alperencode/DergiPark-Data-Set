Makale Başlığı: The Relation between the Uric Acid Levels and the Recanalization Times in Patients with Cerebral Venous Thrombosis
Özet: Recanalization times in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) patients are generally around six months, but do vary from patient to patient. The reasons for the variation in the recanalization times between the CVT patients are still a matter of debate. Thus, in this study, the relation between the uric acid (UA) level, which has been shown to have antioxidant properties in ischemic stroke, and the recanalization time in CVT patients was investigated. In this context, the CVT patients, who were followed up between January 2015 and May 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 78 patients, who met the eligibility criteria to be included in the research, 76.9 % were female and 23.1 % were male. It was determined that headache was the most common (73.1 %) symptom, and that the gynecological reasons were the most common (38.5 %) etiological reasons. A weakly significant negative correlation was found between the UA levels and the recanalization times in the study group (P = 0.003, r= -0.327). There was a weakly negative correlation between the UA levels and the recanalization times in female patients (P = 0.046, r= -0.259). The UA levels of male patients were also found to be negatively correlated with the recanalization times, albeit not statistically significantly. The finding that the recanalization times were shortened as UA levels were increased in female CVT patients was interpreted as that there is a gender-specific relationship between the UA levels and the recanalization times in CVT patients.

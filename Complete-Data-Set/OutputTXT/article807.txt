Makale Başlığı: Growth promotion of apple sapling by bacterial inoculants
Özet: Objective: In study; it was aimed to determine the effects of Bacillus subtilis OSU-142 and Bacillus megaterium M-3 bacteria strains on growth of apple saplings. Materials and Methods: In study was conducted at Karaman. It was used Fuji, Golden Delicious, Mondial Gala, Pink Lady, Red Chief, Scarlet Spur cultivars grafted on MM106 rootstock. Results: Bacteria applications increased the sapling height compared to the control, the highest increase occurred in OSU-142 + M-3. In general, bacteria have increased the root length. The highest increase in root number was obtained from M-3 application in Mondial Gala, Scarlet Spur, Red Chief and Pink Lady cultivars. Conclusion: As a result, bacteria have been confirmed to enhance development and it is suggested to use to encourage growth at apple saplings cultivation.

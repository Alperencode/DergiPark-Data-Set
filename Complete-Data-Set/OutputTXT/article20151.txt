Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Triage and Glasgow Coma Scale Findings in Cats in Trauma Emergencies
Özet: In the study, it was aimed to understand the traumas which was observed in cats and the pathological conditions that may occur due to these traumas by using animal trauma triage score (ATT) and modified Glasgow coma score scales (mGCS), and to reveal the preparation stage for them, the prognosis of the patient and the results of objective evaluation. The study material consisted of 30 cats of various ages, breeds and genders, brought to the Department of Surgery of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Selçuk University in a 10-month period between 2020-2021. The mean age of the cases was between 6 months and 2 years. Skeletal and neurological system examinations were performed, and mGCS and ATT scores were determined and noted. Clinical, radiological, ultrasonographic examinations and blood gas analyzes of the cases were performed. According to the scoring system findings, 30 cats; triage color coding was done with 6 of them green code (20%), 14 of them yellow code (46,6%), 10 of them red code (33,3%). ATT score distribution of thirty cats; 3,3% to 0 points, 6,6% to 1 point, 23,3% to 2 points, 33,3% to 3 points, 6,6% to 4 points, 13,3% to 5 points,  3,3% to 6 points, 6,6% to 8 points and 3,3% to 12 points were observed. Trauma distributions in cats; It was determined that it was due to falling from a height in 20 cases, traffic accidents in 4 cases, and being bitten in 3 cases, while the cause is unknown in 3 cases. The distribution of fracture cases is; 3 tibia, 6 femur, 2 humerus, 2 phalanx, 2 hernia diaphragmatica, 5 sacroiliac luxation, 1 calcaneal luxation, 2 antebrachial fractures, 2 vertebral fractures, 1 multiple coxa fracture, 1 metatarsal fracture, 2 soft tissue injuries and 2 cases in various regions determined as wound formation. As a result, it has been determined that the modified Glasgow coma scale and animal trauma triage scoring will be beneficial for the clinician in terms of prognosis and provide a more objective evaluation of the patient.

Makale Başlığı: STAT3 Expression and Correlation Between Ki-67 and PHH3 in Meningiomas: Is it Possible to Predict Recurrence?
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between PHH3 and ki-67 labeling index, and the association of STAT3 expression with mitotic index, grade by World Health Organization 2016 classification, and clinicopathological features of meningioma cases.Material and Methods: A total of 25 meningioma cases from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Düzce University School of Medicine, diagnosed between 2012 and 2021 were included in the study. The mitotic count from the ten fields with the highest number of mitotic figures was determined. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks to determine STAT3, ki-67, and PHH3 expression. STAT3 was scored between 0 and 3 points according to staining intensity. Staining percentages for STAT3 were determined using a manual count of stained cells and the total number of tumor cells. The ki-67 labeling index was determined as a percentage by a manual count. For PHH3, the total number of immunostained mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields were evaluated in each case.Results: A statistically significant difference was found in terms of the percentage of STAT3 staining between the tumor grades (p=0.047). STAT3 expression was significantly higher in cases with high tumor grades. A moderate positive correlation was found between ki-67 and PHH3 when calculated as a percentage in the area with the highest mitotic index by manual counting (r=0.621, p=0.001).Conclusion: A combination of ki-67, PHH3, and STAT3 will be useful in the grading of meningiomas and predict the recurrence.

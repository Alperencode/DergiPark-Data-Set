The research was conducted with 20 teacher candidates studying in the 3rd grade of science teaching at a state university in the fall semester of the 2021-2022 academic year. In the study, the phenomenology method, which is a pattern of qualitative research, was used. A semi-structured interview form was prepared in order to learn  teacher candidates skills in associating biomimicry examples with physics concepts and daily life. In this form consisting from fifteen questions, open-ended questions were included. The answers given to the questions were categorized and analyzed by determining the codes. At the end of the study, it was found that the  teacher candidates skills of designing or developing a new product inspired by the biomimicry samples selected in the research and associating biomimicry samples with physics concepts were at a sufficient level.

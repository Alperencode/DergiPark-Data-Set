Özet: Aim: The convenient cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube, fixes the tube in the correct position , provides sufficient ventilation, and prevents complications. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the adequacy of the training and experience of nurses working in the intensive care units on cuff care in patients with intubation and tracheostomy. Material and Methods: Fifty nurses working in intensive care units in chest diseases hospital agreed to participate in the study. The 10-question questionnaire was asked face-to-face to the participating nurses and their answers were recorded.Results: Twenty three nurses (46%) surveyed had more than 5 years of intensive care experience. Thirty five nurses (70%) had  bachelor's degree. To the question of  ‘what is the cuff function?’, 72% of the nurses who participated in the survey answered as fixing the tube, 64% as preventing air leakage, and 44% as protecting the lungs from gastric secretions.According to intensive care unit working time, the rate of training on cuff pressure is statistically significantly higher in people who have worked for 5 years or more than those who have worked for less than 5 years.In terms of all questions, there is no statistically significant difference according to education level.Conclusion: The nurses working in our intensive care  unit had lack of knowledge and lack of training about cuff pressure monitoring and cuff exercises. Nurses working in intensive care units should be given in-service training on cuff pressure and cuff exercises.

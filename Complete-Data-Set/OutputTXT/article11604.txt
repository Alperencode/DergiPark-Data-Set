Makale Başlığı: A Model Proposal for Establishing a Hospice Care System in Turkey
Özet: Patients who are predicted to be in the last stage of their disease and their relatives need to be followed by a multidisciplinary team in institutions known as hospices.The aim of this review is to present a model proposal specific to the socio-cultural structure of our country regarding the approach of death of patients with hopeless prognosis, which has become an ethical problem in the world and in our country in recent years, and the institutionalization of the hospice, which has been adopted as an alternative method to euthanasia.The hospice model proposal study for Turkey was carried out within the scope of a doctoral thesis. In this study, some examples of hospice organizations in Germany, which were established with the philosophy of protecting the quality of life of patients and their relatives in the natural process of death, living the accepted death in a humane way, and providing the necessary physiological and psychosocial support to the relatives of the patients in the mourning process after death, were examined and a hospice model specific to our country was proposed.

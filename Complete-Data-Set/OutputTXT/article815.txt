Makale Başlığı: The effect of post-harvest chitosan applications on some chemical changes of potatoes during storage
Özet: Objective: The objective of this study was determination of effects of the chitosan application on changes at some chemical properties of potatoes such as dry matter rate, C vitamin amount, total soluble solids rates, total phenolic compounds and total antioxidant capacity. Material and Method: In this research carried out in cold storage, 4 doses (control, 0.5%, 1% and 2%) of chitosan were applied to potato tubers by spraying method before storage. Results: Among chitosan treatments, 1 % treatment was most effective in terms of preventing the increase dry matter rate (by 50%) and the decrease C vitamin content (by approximately 40%) during the storage. The increase of total phenolic compounds by 20% at the end of storage was prevented with chitosan applications compared to control. Conclusion: Results show that the application of chitosan can reduce some chemical changes that occur in potatoes during storage.

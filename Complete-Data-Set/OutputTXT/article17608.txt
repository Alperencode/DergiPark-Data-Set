Makale Başlığı: EFFECT OF DIGITAL GAME DOWNLOAD SPEED ON USER PROFILE
Özet: Digital games stand out as a product of the effort to integrate communication into the virtual world. The digital gaming culture, which started to emerge right after the user-based emergence of computer technology, includes the sector with a budget of billions of dollars today. However, digital game download performance, which is one of the most important factors in this development and spread of digital games, stands out as an important factor that directly affects the user profile. Considering that the development of a country's digital infrastructure directly affects the production of digital content, it is of great importance to examine the performance of downloading digital content on the Internet. In this study, the digital content download rates offered by Steam, one of the world's largest digital content provider platforms, for Turkey are examined for two months (February 21, 2022 - April 17, 2022). The reason why Steam is preferred is that it is one of the largest in the industry with an average of 24 million online and an average of 7 million offline players, and periodically shares the statistics obtained through the platform with the public. In addition, the download data on the Steam platform of Greece, the developing border neighbor, where Turkey competes in many areas, and the USA and China, the two countries with the world's largest digital content download rates, are analyzed. The main reason for this is the comparison of the performances of Greece, which is almost close in terms of possibilities with the content download performance of users in Turkey on the Steam platform, and the performances of the world giants USA and China, so that due diligence can be made for Turkey. In the review, the rates are ranked according to the number of bits transmitted to the network in a two-month period, and the situation is determined on the effect and place of Turkish users in the digital game market, data is compiled and suggestions are presented for researchers.

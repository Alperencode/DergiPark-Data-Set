Makale Başlığı: The Evaluation of Psychological Factors in Smoking Addicts and Quitters
Özet: Tobacco use is an important public health problem. It is known that psychological factors are also important for both smoking and smoking cessation treatment. A total of 256 people, 172 smokers and 84 quitters, participated in the study. Sociodemographic data form, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Risk Profile Scale were applied to the participants. According to our results, only anxiety sensitivity scores of quitters (add) were found to be significantly higher than those, who currently smoke (p=0.005). In addition, current smokers are divided into three groups according to their level of use: low, moderate and severe. Impulsivity scored significantly higher in the severely dependent group than that of the low and moderate dependent groups (p=0.005 and p=0.047); In anxiety sensitivity, it was determined that the severely dependent group got significantly lower scores than the low dependent group (p=0.002). The results of our study indicate the importance of impulsivity and anxiety sensitivity factors in cigarette addiction. Addressing these factors can guide both the treatment of addiction and the remission process. It is important to understand psychological factors to understand smoking addiction and to increase success in the cessation process. Therefore, we aimed to review the psychological factors in smoking addiction.

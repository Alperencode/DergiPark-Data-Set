Makale Başlığı: Comparative analysis and manufacturing of airfoil structures suitable for use at low speeds
Özet: An aerodynamic technique to calculating lift and drag coefficients is one of the required instruments in the wing design process. During the last decades, several tools and software have been developed according to aero-dynamics and numerical methods. Nowadays, aeronautical architecture requires many calculations. Today’s techno-logists use a variety of simulation techniques to avoid a expensive model testing. This paper explains how wing profiles can be modelled using ANSYS Fluent and tested by low-speed tests considering experimental literature re-sults. With the selected wing profile, the geometry is shaped in two dimensions and designed in three dimensions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was adopted as the method for studying wing profiles. Wing profiles created at 0 to 20-degree attack angles are calculated in the simulation area equal to the actual wind tunnel scale, and equations are solved using the RNG k-Epsilon turbulence model. The process of developing the grids was realized with Ansys Mesher software. The solution stage and the result show operations were carried out with the CFD Post software. The study of the low velocity and high transport wing profiles, the drag coefficient, the lift coefficient, and the effect on the lift-drag ratio were studied using a numerical procedure. After determining the high efficiency of wing profi-les, production of a selected profile began with a static examination.

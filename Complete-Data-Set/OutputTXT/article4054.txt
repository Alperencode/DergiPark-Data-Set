Makale Başlığı: Direct and Indirect Communication Styles in Turkish and German Idioms: A Cultural Linguistic Analysis
Özet: Each society has its own unique cultural characteristics, and each person is born into this cultural accumulation. These cultural characteristics affect their behavior and the type of communication between people. For example, in high-context cultures such as Turkish culture, where it is important to maintain family, friend and family ties, especially to avoid conflicts, a more complex, indirect form of communication is preferred in which wide-ranging messages are used during communication. In low-context cultures such as German culture, individuals express their feelings, thoughts, or desires in clear and understandable words. During communication, only the necessary information is provided, more than necessary information is avoided. Based on this situation, in this study, verbal communication phenomena in Turkish and German idioms, which are products of cultures that contain concise meanings and which we frequently use to express situations that are difficult to explain in a short and effective way, have been analyzed in terms of cultural linguistics and analyzed within the framework of intercultural communication theories. At the end of the study, it was determined that the above-mentioned types of communication were reflected in Turkish and German idioms, and it was revealed that the number of idioms containing direct communication in German is higher than the number of Turkish idioms containing the same subject, and the opposite is true in Turkish idioms containing the indirect communication phenomenon.

Makale Başlığı: Antibacterial Research of the Usability of Some Plant Extracts in Surgical Mask Production
Özet: In this study, pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) peel, large and small fruits of cocklebur(Xanthium strumarium L.), german chamomile (Anthemis nobilis L.) flower, may chamomile(Matricaria chamomilla L.) flower, red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seed, green pepper (Capsicumannuum L.) seed extracts and solid silver were investigated about antibacterial effects. At the endof the study, Xanthium strumarium L. extracts showed more antibacterial zones about 166.6%on Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and 70% on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) comparedto the control. In bacteria spreading from the oral flora, the highest antibacterial effects wereobserved in the Xanthium strumarium L. and colloidal silver which had 166.6% more antibacterialzones compared to the control. The antibacterial effects of surgical mask samples containingplant extracts were investigated and it was determined that the sample containing the Xanthiumstrumarium L. extract provided 39% less bacterial growth than the control.

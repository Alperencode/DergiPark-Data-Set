Makale Başlığı: THE PROJECTION OF THE SOCIALIST REALISTIC MANIFEST IN CHILD THEMED POEMS
Özet: A new understanding of art, which started to take shape in Russia at the beginning of the 1930s, was also influenced many countries of the world over time. This understanding springing forth since the inception of marxist ideology influenced almost all literaty works, from dramatic and performing arts to written works and poetry  This understanding, which showed its influence especially in the genres of novels and poetry in the 1940s in our country, is known as "socialist-realist". In this understanding, which positions the artist as a social engineer, the work of art has to be a useful tool for society  before its aesthetic importance. For this reason, the main goal of socialist realist artists is to produce works that will provide enlightenment to the public rather than reach  high art. The artists of this understanding, which gave birth to great names in the field of poetry, are also known as the “40’s Generation”, referring to the years in which they developed in our country. These poets, who put issues such as humans, workers and mechanization, which concern the whole country and even the world, at the center of their poetry, also gave importance to children, whom they saw as the future hope of society. In this study, it was tried to determine the projections of the ideological values of socialist realist poets in their poems with the theme of "child".

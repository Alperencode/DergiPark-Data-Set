Makale Başlığı: Turkish Standardization of Feeling Word Checklist-Brief Version [FWC-BV]: A Quantitative Examination of Countertransference
Özet: As proposed by Freud, the concept of transference could be described as the repetition of patients’ forms of relating based on their past experiences and subjective structures. Countertransference, on the other hand, could be portrayed as the emergence of various affects, unconscious conflicts, and attitudes of therapists about patients’ discourse during the psychotherapy process. In the literature, different studies have examined the concept of countertransference using quantitative methods on the grounds that countertransference also manifests itself on the conscious level. The current study aimed to conduct the Turkish standardization of the Feeling Word Checklist-Brief Version [FWC-BV], a brief version of the Feeling Word Checklist designed to assess the countertransference levels of therapists. The sample of the study was composed of 184 psychologists who practiced psychotherapy using different therapeutic approaches. Based on analyses carried out to investigate the factor structure of the Turkish version of Feeling Word Checklist-Brief Version [FWC-BV], confirmatory factor analysis results indicated a three-factor structure consistent with the original version. Results of reliability and validity analyses suggested that the scale has acceptable psychometric properties. All results were discussed regarding the psychoanalytic literature.

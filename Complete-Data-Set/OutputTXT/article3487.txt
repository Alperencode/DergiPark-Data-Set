Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the effect of gossypin on MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes in prostate cancer cells
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore the effects of gossypin on matrix metalloproteinases -2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 genes in prostate cancer cells. Materials and Methods: PC3 cells were grown in culture and treated with three different concentrations of gossypin (25-50-100 µg/ml) and cisplatin (50 µM) as a positive control. First, RNA isolation was performed. Then, cDNA synthesis was performed and RT-PCR was used to evaluate mRNA expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes.Results: Gossypin decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression in prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Three concentrations (25-50-100 µg/ml) of gossypin in PC3 cells reduced the mRNA expression of the MMP-2 gene. While the fold change value of MMP-2 gene expression was 0.3482 ± 0.040 in the 100 µg/ml gossypin group, it was 1.007 ± 0.1425 in the control group. In addition, 50 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml concentrations of gossypin decreased the mRNA expression of the MMP-9 gene. The expression level of the MMP-9 gene in prostate cancer cells was 0.4740 ± 0.038 in the 100 µg/ml gossypin administered group, while it was 1.009 ± 0.1687 in the control group. There was a positive correlation between the expressions of the MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes.Conclusion: According to the results obtained, it is seen that gossypin reduces the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes in prostate cancer cells and the effects of gossypin on other genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in cancer need to be investigated to reveal the anti-cancer.

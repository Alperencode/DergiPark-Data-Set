Makale Başlığı: Refugee Status in Turkey After The End Of World War II, As Reported By The International Rescue and Relief Committee (IRRC)
Özet: Given its position as a bridge between Asia and Europe and neutral status, Turkey hosted thousands of refugees during World War II. The number of refugees seeking refuge in Turkey increased daily as the war stretched to the Balkans. There were 22,209 refugees in the country as of March 1943. In 1943, a huge percentage of these refugees were either repatriated or moved to refugee camps in other countries. By the end of the war, however, there were nearly 1,500 refugees who could not be repatriated for various reasons and continued to stay in Turkey. The purpose of this study is to identify the status of the refugees remaining in Turkey after the end of World War II by comparing a report issued by the International Rescue and Relief Committee (IRRC) in the United Nations Archive with the relevant documents available in the Republic Archives of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey Directorate of State Archives.

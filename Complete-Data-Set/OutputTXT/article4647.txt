Makale Başlığı: Reading Tourism Urbanization in Turkey Through Employment Data
Özet: In this study, the rapid growth and structural change of employment, which is one of the variables of tourism urbanization, has been examined through the cities of Çeşme, Kuşadası, Didim, Bodrum, Marmaris, Fethiye, Kemer, Antalya, Manavgat, and Alanya, which are known as the international tourism centers of Turkey. To reveal the tourism urbanization in the axis of employment data, employment data were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) and the Social Security Institution (SSI). Based on these data, the rapid growth of the workforce in the tourism sector, the employment creation potential, and the seasonal characteristics of tourism have been explained. According to the findings obtained; in the 1985-2000 period, while the growth rate of general employment in tourism cities varied between 85% and 440%; in the provincial centers of these cities, it remained between 23% and 45%. In the 2005-2019 period, while the growth rate of general employment in tourism cities was between 50% and 204%; these rates varied between 12% and 74% in provincial centers. The fact that the employment rate of change in tourism cities in the 1985-2000 period is much more striking than in the 2005-2019 period is related to the tourism incentives and investments in the mentioned period. While the rates of those employed in tourism-related activity branches in the 1985-2019 period were between 32% and 75% in tourism cities; this rate remained between 5%-30% in provincial centers. Our data also revealed important results regarding the seasonal character of employment. In all tourism cities, the lowest number of employees was observed in January and the highest number of employees was observed in July and August. The most important result of the study is that tourism-related employment data reveals an employment model specific to tourist cities.

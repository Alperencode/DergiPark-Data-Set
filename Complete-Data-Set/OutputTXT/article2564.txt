Makale Başlığı: BUILDING RESIDENCE AREA EXTRACTION PROCESS WITH POLYNOMIAL APPROACH IN FREE BUILDING IDENTITY ZONING PLOTS
Özet: The zoning islands in the identity of free buildings are one of the island types in the zoning plan. It has an aspect that distinguishes it from the zoning islands with certain definite features such as separate, block and adjacent. It is a building regulation in the identity of a zoning island, which is applicable in application zoning plans, especially in new development and settlement areas. On the islands with the identity of free construction, the building permit withdrawal dimensions are given on the basis of different precedents. As a method, it has been tried to be explained with examples on how to draw the parcels to the base according to certain rules with polynomial nesting. The polynomial is mathematically the process of constructing subsets or subsets from the universal set. In planning applications, it is the process of creating the right building stock by specifying the garden distances from the outside to the inside. Especially in the identity of free building, the most important part in these garden distances is to create the building sitting area by pulling the right side garden.  In this way, an examination was made about how a different approach in the zoning plans will be given to the zoning islands with the identity of free buildings from general to specific.

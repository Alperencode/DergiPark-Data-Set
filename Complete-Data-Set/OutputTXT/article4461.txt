Makale Başlığı: Efficacy of Transarterial Chemoembolization with Drug-Eluting Beads in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Single-Center Experience
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and Methods: Twenty-nine patients with HCC who were treated with TACE with drug-eluting beads between 2019 and 2021 were included in the study. The success of the TACE procedure was evaluated using pre- and post-operative contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance images. Patient characteristics, embolizing-bead sizes, procedure-related complications, and pre- and post-procedure alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were recorded.Results: The mean age of the patients was 65.6±10.4 years, and the objective response rate was 17.2% (5/29). 100-300 μm particles were used in 11 (37.9%) patients, and 300-500 μm particles were used in 18 (62.1%). The median target lesion number was 1 (range, 1-6). Six (20.7%) patients had non-target lesions. There were newly developed lesions in four (13.8%) patients. A significant decrease was found in the median target lesion size after (41; range, 0-116 mm) the procedure compared to the pre- (42; range, 22-188 mm) procedure (p<0.001). A significant difference was found between the median AFP levels before (343; range, 1.44-2000 ng/mL) and after (52; range, 0.95-1435 ng/mL) the procedure (p<0.001).Conclusion: Since most patients with HCC are diagnosed in the intermediate stage, curative treatment is not possible. TACE is an important treatment option for the local control of the disease in this patient group. However, the success of TACE treatment may vary depending on the cancer stage, number of patients, follow-up period, and type and size of the microsphere used.

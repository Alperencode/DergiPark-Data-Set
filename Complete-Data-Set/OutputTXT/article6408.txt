Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF DRIVER SAFETY PRIORITY ON SLEEPY DRIVING BEHAVIOR: LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Özet: Driver safety priority is among the factors that affect the sleepy driving behavior of truck drivers. The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of truck drivers' driver safety priority on sleepy driving behavior with linear and non-linear models. Two hypotheses have been developed within the scope of the research. The sample area consists of 399 Turkish truck drivers. Surveys were collected face to face and online between January 2022 and April 2022. The sample area has been determined by simple random method. "Driver safety priority" and "Sleepy driving behavior" scales is used, which is tested for reliability and validity. Simple regression analysis has been performed for the linear model. In the selection of non-linear models, curve estimation models have been tested. The “Power” estimation model has been determined as the best model. According to the research findings, driver safety priority has a negative and significant effect on sleepy driving behavior in both linear and non-linear models. In addition, it has been determined that there is no significant difference between the percentages of explanation of linear and non-linear models. It has also been determined that the coefficient of the driver safety priority of the linear model on sleepy driving behavior is higher than the non-linear model. Based on the empirical findings, implications for both managers and drivers have been presented.

Makale Başlığı: Paradoxical Advantage of Middle Aged Sedentary over Young Sedentary on Starting Exercise in Terms of GH/IGF-1 System
Özet: The aim of this study was to investigatethe effects of the submaximal running exercise on the GH/IGF-1 axis in the middleaged sedentary nonobese and preobese males. 24 healthy volunteer males were dividedinto 2 groups and then 2 subgroups according to their age ranges (20-25 and35-43) and Body Mass Indexes (BMI) (nonobese- NO and preobese- PO) respectively.All subjects underwent a submaximal running exercise for 30 minutes a day/ 4days a week and for a period of 6 weeks. Serum GH, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and insulinlevels were measured in all subjects before and after the exercise program. IGFBP-3levels were found to be statistically decreased in the PO middle aged and NOyoung groups whereas IGF-1 levels were statistically increased in NO younggroup after the exercise treatment. Surprisingly PO and NO middle aged groups’Insulin and GH responses against exercise were quite opposite of those observedin young groups. In the light of the findings, it could be suggested that themiddle aged group’s response against exercise on the base of GH/IGF-1 systemwas more effective than the young group, was found to be quite interesting.

Makale Başlığı: The Origin of the Authority and its Effect on the Fundamentalist Difference. Consensus as a Model.
Özet: This study represents one of the attempts aimed at explaining the collateral relations between fundamentalist issues, as it focused on researching the origin of Authority, one of the most important overall evidence for the fundamentalists, which is the consensus. This study included in its outset an explanation of the terms (Authority) and (Consensus) in linguistic and idiomatic terms, followed by mentioning the speech of the fundamentalists in the authority of the consensus, as well as their methods of determining the origin through which the consensus was acquired by describing the authority, analyzing these approaches and determining the evidence on which it was based. This study has also taken care to examine the practical effect of the difference in determining the origin of the authority of consensus, which is the disagreement in two other fundamentalist issues: the first of which is the issue of requiring the number of recurrence in the two compilers. The second is the issue of the consensus of previous nations.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF SIMULTANEOUS COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE JURISDICTION ON THE EFFICIENCY OF CORPORATE COMMUNICATION: THE CASE OF SEGBIS ERZURUM
Özet: The fact that people can communicate in real time without the limitation of space has brought video conferencing systems to an important position on a global scale. Audio and Visual Information System (SEGBIS), developed and put into use by the Ministry of Justice to be used during the execution of judicial activities in 2011, has become one of the original video conferencing systems used within public institutions and organizations. This study aims to determine the effect of using the Audio and Visual Information System (SEGBIS), one of the simultaneous communication technologies, on the efficiency of corporate communication in judicial activities. In the research, the effect of simultaneous communication technologies on the efficiency of corporate communication was determined based on the skills, attitudes, and behaviors of judges, public prosecutors, lawyers, and user support personnel, who are the actors of the process in the proceedings made over SEGBİS. In the study, which was carried out with the instrumental case study design, one of the qualitative research methods, two data collection tools consisting of face-to-face interviews with judges, prosecutors, user personnel, and litigation lawyers working in the court, were used. Erzurum Regional Court of Justice and SEGBİS hearing observations were used. As a result of the study, the use of SEGBIS has been found to increase the efficiency of corporate communication in the areas of efficient use of time, speed and practicality in the investigation phase, convenience in urgent business and transactions, and economic contribution.

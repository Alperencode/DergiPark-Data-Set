Makale Başlığı: İmparator Herakleios Döneminde Bizans'ın Doğu Politikası ve Armenia
Özet: The beginning of the 7th century was a period of complete chaos in Byzantine history. The arrival of the Sassanids in front of Chalcedon and threatening the capital are critical events in Byzantine history. When Heraclius took imperial power, he planned what he should do for a long time, and determined his policy in the East, although there was a great danger in the West. Armenians played a crucial role in the mainobjectives of this policy. Armenians were the main actors in the new system that Heraclius envisioned, and they played their roles properly. Heraclius restrained the Sassanids, but a new player, whom he never expected, appeared on the stage of history. These players were Muslim Arabs and would replace the Western perception of Persia. Armenians would be affected by this situation as much as Byzantium.

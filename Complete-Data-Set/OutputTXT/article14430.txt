Makale Başlığı: Religion as a Form of Civic Resistance in The Year Of The Flood
Özet: This article focuses on the teachings and actions of God's Gardeners, an anarchist, religious and environmental organization, most widely described in the The Year of the Flood, the second book of Atwood's MaddAddam trilogy. This novel, on the one hand, focuses on the environmental and climate crisis, on the other hand, describes the living conditions of the low socioeconomic classes from different perspectives. In this future fiction, capitalist institutions took over the administrative power with the help of modern science and suspended the democratic administration. Religious minorities of different faiths and origins, whose number and supporters increased rapidly, came out with the claim of filling the gap emerged after the disappearance of democratic institutions in civil society. It is seen that the Gardeners movement has gained strength by finding positive confirmation from the middle and lower classes, and especially from the oppressed women of any class. It is claimed that the Gardeners, as represented in the trilogy, were supported by various segments of society, and turned into a form of civic resistance in time.

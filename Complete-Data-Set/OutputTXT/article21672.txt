Makale Başlığı: Examining the Self-Regulatory Skills and Strategies of Coping with Bullying of 60-72 Month Old Children
Özet: This study aimed to examine the self-regulation skills of 60-72 month-old children attending pre-school education and their coping strategies with bullying. The study sample consists of 85 children of 60-72 months and 16 teachers attending pre-school education institutions located in Beykoz, Üsküdar, and Ümraniye districts of Istanbul Province selected by convenience sampling method. In the study, "Demographic Information Form," "Self-Regulation Scale for Children 4-6 Years Old Teacher Form", and "Coping With Bullying Strategies Problem Stories Form" were used. A mixed research model was used in this study, and cross-comparison of the answers obtained was calculated with arithmetic mean and standard deviations. Participant children with high self-regulation skills mostly used active and mixed strategies in coping with bullying. On the other hand, it was found that children with low self-regulation skills mostly used avoidant and emotion-oriented strategies. Besides, it was found that the self-regulation skill levels of the children were determinant of the ways of expressing their feelings and explaining the reasons for bullying. Therefore, it has been suggested that the self-regulation skill levels of children should be identified and supported at an early stage to provide that they can apply effective coping strategies with bullying.

Makale Başlığı: In Vitro Propagation of Endemic Mor Mercan Plant (Origanum sipyleum L.)
Özet: Origanum sipyleum L. known as “Mor Mercan” is one of the endemic plant species of Turkey, belonging to the Lamiaceae family, and carrying highly valuable medicinal and aromatic properties. Many scientific studies have shown that Origanum spp have anticarcinogenic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antifungal, antiviral, and insecticidal  effects. However, there are very few scientific studies on the propagation of Origanum sipyleum L. using advanced biotechnological methods that provide new means for conserving genetic resources and rapid multiplication of valuable and endangered medicinal plants. Therefore, this study was conducted for propagation of plant genetic resource material of Origanum sipyleum L. that was collected from Izmir/Bozdag using in vitro techniquies which is a biotechnological method. Effects of two types of explants (nodes and shoot tips) and four different media (MS+0.5 mg L-1 BAP + 0.1 mg L-1 IAA; MS+1.0 mg L-1 BAP+0.1 mg L-1 IAA; ½MS+ 0.5 mg L-1 BAP + 0.1 mg L-1 IAA; ½MS+ 1.0 mg L-1 BAP + 0.1 mg L-1 IAA) on shoot number and shoot lenght of Origanum sipyleum L. were investigated. The highest shoots per explant (5.56) were obtained from nodal explants growing on MS medium containing 1.0 mg L-1 BAP+ 0.1 mg L-1 IAA. Developed plantlets were successfully transplanted into potting mixture of soil-perlite(2:1).

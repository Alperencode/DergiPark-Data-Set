Makale Başlığı: Chemical Content and Antimicrobial Activity of Cyclotrichium  origanifolium (Labill.) Manden. & Scheng. Plant Essential Oil Obtained from Adana Region
Özet: The aims of this paper to evaluate the chemical composition and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of Cyclotricium origanifolium (Labill.) Manden. & Scheng., which grows naturally in Türkiye. The essential oil of the aerial plant parts was acquired through the hydrodistillation method in a Clevenger type device, and it was examined with GC-MS/FID. As a result of the applied hydrodistillation process, the essential oil yield was obtained as 3.63%. The structure of 66 components that were detected in the essential oil was determined by comparing with the database and literature data in the appliance. As a result of the analysis, the structure of 64 compounds was determined, but the structure of 2 compounds could not be determined. cis-3-pinanone (isocamphopinone), β-pinene and eucalyptol compounds were determined the main components respectively at the rates of 33.43%, 25.27% and 23.91%. The highest chemical compound classes in the analyzed essential oil was determined as monoterpenes with 52.84% and as monoterpenoids with 44.11%. The groups with the highest number of compounds in the chemical classes in the essential oil were monoterpenoids with 27 compounds and monoterpenes with 16 compounds. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was investigated with the disc diffusion test method against 13 different microorganisms activated. According to the results of the antimicrobial activities analysis of essential oil obtained from plant samples; the highest antibacterial activity was recorded against Escherichia coli O157:H7 from gram-negative bacteria with inhibition zone ranging as (4.55±0.01 mm), Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes from gram-positive bacteria with inhibition zone ranging as (6.50±0.01 mm), (5.65±0.01 mm) respectively. In addition, it was determined that they did not show any antifungal activity against any of the yeast-molds tested.

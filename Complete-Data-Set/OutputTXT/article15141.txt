From this point of view, it is understood that mujtahid tabaqāt have a close connection with intra-school preference. Mujtahids, who are placed in different ranks in the mujtahid tabaqāt in terms of their scientific level, represent various aspects of intra-school preference activities where they are. In this study, Tabaqāt al-Mujtahid has been tried to examined on the basis of the Shafii scool. The reason why the study is limited to the Shafii school is that the Hanafi sect is taken as the basis in the studies on the subject in our country, and the classification of the Shafi'is is not mentioned at all, even if it is mentioned, it is limited to brief information. It is clear that this situation also contains a deficiency in the field. Due to the reasons mentioned above, in this study, besides understanding the nature of the tabaqāt al-mujtahid al-shafii, the role they played in intra-school preference activities has been also tried to be determined.

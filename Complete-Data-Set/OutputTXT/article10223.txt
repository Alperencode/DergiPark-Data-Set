Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Important Mesoscopic Tectonics Structures Between of the Yalıhüyük and Akkise (Konya Southern)
Özet: In the Yalıhüyük-Akkise (Konya) region of the Middle Taurus Orogenic Belt, the   Mesozoic rock groups of the relatively autochthonous Geyikdağı and the allochthonous Bozkır Units of the Taurus Mountains are covered by Late Neogene-Quaternary Neo- Autochthonous post-paroxysmal cover rocks with a regional angular unconformity. Fold axis orientations and main fractures in the region are generally in the trend of NNW-SSE. This trend is in general compatible with the morpho-tectonic structure of the region that is belong to the paleotectonic period. Younger neotectonic fractures with NNE-SSW and E-W trending that cut through the main folds and fractures are also present in the region. The boundaries of the rock forming the Neo-autochthonous unit are generally faulted, and the low relief areas of the region are mostly depression areas. Most of the depressions around Yalıhüyük-Akkise are half-grabens formed under the control of these fractures. The formation of these grabens is due to the fact that the areas that were collapsed and bowled by paleotectonic events were filled with river-lake-mountain foot hills and alluvial deposits during the neo-tectonic period and on the other hand, the region was faulted again with Neo-tectonic movements.

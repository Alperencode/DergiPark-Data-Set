Makale Başlığı: CULT OF FIRE IN TURKISH MYTHOLOGY AND ITS TRACES IN AMASYA
Özet: Throughout history, some practices and rules have affected the lives of nations and have been directly influential in people's daily lives, directing or affecting their behaviours, thoughts and activities. These show themselves in the form of religious or folk beliefs and within the framework of certain rituals and cults. In Turkish culture, the acceptance of particular beings in nature as living or approaching them with respect has also led to cults around many objects such as water, tree, mountain and stone. The cults that are the subject of Turkish mythology have also shaped the behaviour and thoughts of people in various aspects. One of the crucial cults among Turkish folk beliefs, which we can express in the context of traditional Turkish religion, is fire. The Turkish nation has carried out some practices and rituals around fire or fire-centred since the earliest times, and they have taken these beliefs with them wherever they go, regardless of the changing time and place. The fire cult showed itself in various aspects of Turkish culture and mythology. Sometimes as a cleansing element, it protects from evil spirits and evil; sometimes as a healing, therapeutic element against diseases; sometimes protecting from the evil eye; In general terms, it has been a cult that has survived until today in connection with the cult of family-hearth-house-ancestors. Because of these characteristics, the fire was approached with respect and some behaviours were avoided with the thought that it would anger her and harm people when she was angry.

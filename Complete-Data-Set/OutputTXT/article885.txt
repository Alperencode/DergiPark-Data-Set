Makale Başlığı: The role of locus of control and motivation in determining the achievement goal model in Turkish National Sailing Athletes: Preliminary study
Özet: Individuals dealing with sailing, which is an outdoor sport, need to focus on the target with determination and be motivated while struggling with the wind, waves, currents, and opponents. The locus of control is accepted as an element that can predict success in sports where such complex mental processes are used. In addition, athletes' orientation towards performance and learning, and their critical perspective are also known as factors determining success and failure. In this study, it was aimed to test whether the locus of control and motivation styles of national sailing athletes determine their success orientation or not. The analogous sampling method, one of the purposeful sampling methods, was used in determining the participants, and the study was carried out with a correlational design. The study included 79 (24 Female, 55 Male) Turkish national athletes (X̄=20.58±5.46), aged 16-35, competing in Laser (Standard, Radial, 4.7), 470, 420, Finn, Windsurfing branches. The following scales were used in the study :“Achievement Goal Model”, “Sport Motivatiob Scale II” and “The Rotter Locus of Control Scale”.According to the results, we found that the determinants of learning-avoidance goal orientation are regulation by identification and external regulation, and the determinants of learning-avoidance goal orientation are regulation by identification and external regulation.As a result, the achievement goals and motivation style of the participants are in interaction and it is thought that determining the locus of control and aspects of motivation are important to understand the athlete's achievement goal orientation.

Özet: disorder (ASD). One hundred and eighty-two children with ASD and their parents were included in the study. The Quality of Life in Autism Scale-Parent Version (QOLA-P) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were filled in by the parents. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was applied by the researcher. It was determined that 85,2% of the children were male (n=155), and the median age of all children was 8 years (2-13). Mothers constituted 79.1% (n=144) of the parents participating in the study. The median value of QOLA-P Part A was 84.00 (39-140), and the median value of of Part B was 55.00 (20-95). The response rate above the cut-off point on the HAD-A scale was 59.3% and 68.1% on the HAD-D scale. There was a negative correlation between the CARS and the QOLA-P Part A (r=-0.201;p=0.006) and Part B (r=-0.486; p<0.001). A negative correlation was found between QOLA-P Part A and HAD-A (r=-0.628; p<0.001) and HAD-D (r=-0.659; p<0.001). Again, a negative correlation was found between QOLA-P Part B and HAD-A (r=-0.438; p<0.001) and HAD-D (r=-0.372; p<0.001). A positive correlation was found between the QOLA-P Part A and the father's education level (r=0.191; p=0.010) and monthly income level (r=0.269; p<0.001). There was a negative correlation between the QOLA-P Part B and the age of the child (r=-0.149; p=0.045), and a positive correlation with monthly income level (r=0.187; p=0.011). Our study determined that factors such as ASD severity, drug use, child's age, income level, and father's education level are among the factors affecting the parental quality of life and mental health. In addition to interventions for children, planning programs that will improve parents' coping skills can increase the parental quality of life and improve mental health.

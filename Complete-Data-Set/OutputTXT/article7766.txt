Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of the Penalties to be Applied to Smuggling Acts in Tax Criminal Law in Terms of Proportionality and Non Bis İn İdem Principles
Özet: In terms of ensuring social order and legal order, states take some measures to prevent the unlawful behavior of individuals. These measures consist of sanctions applied in return for the actions of the perpetrator unlawfully. Again, in terms of ensuring the taxation order in the country, the states punish individuals who cause acts contrary to this order with sanctions. The sanctions in question are expressed in a dual classification as tax misdemeanors and tax crimes. One of the important issues that cause debate is the implementation of sanctions in the doctrine; It is the case that the penalty that binds freedom to be applied as a result of creating a tax evasion crime and tax loss misdemeanor with a single act cannot be combined with a triple tax loss penalty and these two types of sanctions are applied separately.In the study, the literature review method was used, the prison sentence to be applied to the act of tax evasion was evaluated in the context of the principle of proportionality, and the three-fold tax loss penalty to be applied in cases where tax loss occurs in addition to the freedom-binding penalty was examined within the scope of the non-bis in idem principle and suggestions where made on the subject.

Özet: Amasya province, which has an important place in terms of dry onion production and cultivation area in Turkey, ranks 2nd in Turkey in yield. In this research, it is aimed to examine the production and marketing problems of the producers in Amasya, whose amount of onion taken per decare is much higher than the Turkey average. For this purpose, 90 producers who produce onions in the villages/neighbourhoods of Amasya province were interviewed. While the average age of the producers is 46, it has been determined that they have been producing onions for an average of 23 years. It has been determined that the biggest problem of the producers is marketing and the factors that cause this problem are analyzed with the sequential probit model. It has been determined econometrically that the producers' experience of marketing problems: the education level of the producers, their experience in production, their willingness to become a member of a marketing cooperative and the place of sale of the product. Based on the results of the research, it can be suggested to establish a dry onion marketing cooperative in the region, as it will facilitate both the economic difficulties experienced by the producers and the marketing of dried onions, which are problematic in storage.

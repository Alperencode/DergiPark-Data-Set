Özet: Forestry activities are generally carried out far from residential areas and these areas are open to all kinds of external influences. Forestry is a profession that requires high energy and has high accident risks in terms of occupational safety. Forestry work has a number of biological, social, economic, and technical characteristics. While some of the forestry problems in Turkey have common characteristics throughout the country, some of them are specific to the regions. In order to determine the technical problems encountered during forestry activities, this study was carried out in Kahramanmaraş region. It was held with 42 participants consisting of 30 forest enterprise chiefs and forest engineers, 12 enterprise managers and deputy managers working in Kahramanmaraş, Göksun, Andırın, Gaziantep, Kilis, Dörtyol, Andırın, and Antakya Forest Enterprise Directorates affiliated to Kahramanmaraş Forest Regional Directorate. While the first part of the questionnaire consists of data related to some profile characteristics of participants, the second part composes of 12 opinions aimed at identifying technical problems. The data obtained through the survey study were evaluated with the SPSS 24 program. In the study, it was determined that as the most important technical problem with 76.2% in forestry activities is that the administrative boundaries and the enterprise boundaries do not match.

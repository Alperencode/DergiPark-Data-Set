Makale Başlığı: A Research on to Effective on Yield and Earliness of Different Sowing Times and Growing Techniques in Sweet Corn (Zea mays saccarata Sturts) in Kahramanmaraş Conditions
Özet: Inorder to investigate the effect of different sowing times and growingtechniques. On yield and earliness of two sweet corn varieties, this study, wasdone in Kahramanmaraş conditions in 1997 – 1998 growing years. Kahramanmaraşresearch station conditions. Field trials arranged in split – split plot designwith there replications, varieties sowing times and growing techniques wereused an as main, sub and sub – sub plots, respectively. In this study, Meritand Jubilee varieties used as sweet corn varieties.Accordingto result obtained from the experiment interm of starch ration, number of grainper ear and number of plant per unit Merit variety was found to be superior butinterm of days two maturity ear lenght Jubilee was superior. It was determinedthat earliness sweet corn growing was possible by using covered growingtechniques on that covered growing techniques possitively influenced the allcharacteristic studied starch ratio and ear lenght. Effect of sowing times ondays the maturity wasn’t significant. If the temperature is low plant adapted itselftill the temperature research optimum. But days the maturity increased viceverse decreased. The optimum sowing times for the Kahramanmaraş conditions was30 March.

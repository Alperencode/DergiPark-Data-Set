Makale Başlığı: Design of Neural Network Predictor for A Finite Element Analysis of Thermal and Mechanical Stresses Caused in the Jawbone of Implantology
Özet: As implant cavity preparation and healthy bone are essential for primary healing, prevention of mechanical and thermal damage, which occurs at bone, is critical importance. So heat generation under clinical conditions must be kept under control while preparing implant cavity by using surgical guides.  In this study, thermal and mechanical stresses were aimed to predict with computer software while drilling implant cavities. Thermal and mechanical stress analysis that occurs around the jawbone while drilling implant cavities by using plot drills of four different drills with a classical method was conducted by using Finite Elements Method (FEM). The real time estimation was made using data obtained from numerical analysis. The estimation analysis was performed with Adaptive-Network Based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) approach that have a robust and adaptive structure. The results from the ANFIS simulation, the ability to demonstrate the same behavior as the results obtained with the Finite Element Method shows that neural predictor can be used to estimate the system's thermal and Von- Misses stresses parameters. This presentation shows the estimation of thermal and mechanical stresses changes during implant surgery with artificial intelligence.

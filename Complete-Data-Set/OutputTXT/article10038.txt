Özet: AbstractObjective: This study aims to examine the level of vitamin B12 according to trimesters in the pregnant population, to investigate its relationship with malnutrition in cases of insufficiency and deficiency, and to start supplementation with early diagnosis.Material and Methods: Sociodemographic survey data, ultrasonography data, hemogram, biochemistry and vitamin B12 levels of pregnant women who applied to the department of obstetrics and gynecology of a reginal university hospital were examined. SPSS 22.0 statistics program was used to evaluate the data. P<0.05 was considered significant.Results: Two hundred and fifty pregnant women were included in our study. The mean age was 26.42±5.86 (18-40 years). The mean vitamin B12 level of the participants was 214.45±83.99 ng/ml (80-656). According to the postoc duncan test, the vitamin B12 levels of the participants showed a significant difference with the 1st trimester 2 and 3 (p<0.05), while the 2nd and 3rd trimesters did not show a significant difference in themselves (p=0.968). When compared according to socioeconomic levels, vitamin B12 levels of the group with a monthly income of 3001 turkish lira and above was found to be 228.336±63.665 ng/ml,and the group with a monthly income of 3000 turkish lira and below was 199.016±45.630 ng/ml. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p<0.05). Considering the relationship between vitamin B12 levels and nutritional deficiency, vitamin B12 levels were found 268.27±86.96 ng/ml in the group consuming full and/or half servings of animal food daily, and 166.34±41.60 ng/ml in those consuming and/or not consuming a quarter serving. When the two groups were compared with each other, a significant difference was found (p<0.05).Conclusion: Vitamin and mineral balance during pregnancy is very important for maternal and fetal health. Vitamin B12 deficiency and/or insufficiency are in considerable numbers. When necessary, the individual should be trained in terms of proper nutrition immediately with early diagnosis. Supportive treatment from folic acid-vitamin B12 combined drugs should be considered in essential cases according to the profit-loss ratio.

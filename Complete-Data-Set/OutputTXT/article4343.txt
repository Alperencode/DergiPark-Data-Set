Makale Başlığı: The Impact of Maternal Sleep Problems on Obstetric Outcomes and Care
Özet: Sleep is a basic human need and is essential for a healthy and quality life. Women experience sleep disorders other than snoring twice more often than men. During pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum periods, existing sleep problems become severer, and new-onset sleep problems develop. Disorders in maternal sleep begin in the first trimester, decrease in the second trimester, and reach the highest level in the last trimester. Many women giving birth have trouble in sleeping due to staying in hospital, contractions, interventions, drugs used, and emotional problems. In the first postpartum days, the mother's sleep is frequently interrupted for reasons such as breastfeeding and infant care. Three to six months after birth, maternal sleep problems decrease, but sleep quality returns to its pre-pregnancy state. Different obstetric complications develop in association with the type, duration, frequency, and severity of the sleep problem. Depending on this situation, both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality rates increase. When maternal sleep problems are diagnosed and managed appropriately in the early period, the adverse impacts of these problems on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health can be decreased. Therefore, healthcare team members and especially midwives and nurses should not ignore maternal sleep problems. They should diagnose them in the early period, manage them appropriately and enhance the coping mechanisms of women.

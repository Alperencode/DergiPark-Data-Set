Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Using Some Additives on The Quality of Arabic Bread
Özet: : In this study, 3 durum wheat (Triticum durum) and 3 bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) were used. The effect of adding sodium stearol-2-lactylate (SSL), monoglyceride ester of diacetyl tartaric acid (DATEM), vitamin C and α-amylase to the flours obtained from these varieties on the quality of Arabic bread was investigated. The physical, chemical and rheological properties of wheat flour samples were examined. Different combinations of improving additives have been used in making Arabic bread samples as follows: (0.25% SSL+α-amylase, 0.25% DATEM+α-amylase, 0.25% SSL+30 ppm vitamin C+α-amylase, and 0.25% DATEM+30 ppm vitamin C+α-amylase) and sensory analysis was performed for producing bread samples. The values of ash, protein, gluten and falling number of flour samples were 0.45-0.77%, 10.40-12.10%, 26.0-31.0%, and 398-491 sec, respectively. The farinograph analysis showed  the water absorption was 68.4%, development time 3.5 min, and stability time 6.6 min as mean values. The energy value in the extensograph evaluated at 135 min was 51.00 cm2 for durum wheat and 77.00 cm2 for bread wheat. As a result of the study, it was determined that the sensory test results of the breads with 0.25% SSL + 30ppm vitamin C + α-amylase (D) were higher than the breads with other additives. Bread made from durum wheat flour containing this combination received 80.50 points out of 100 in terms of general acceptability, while bread made from bread wheat flour received 93.30 points.

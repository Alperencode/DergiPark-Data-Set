Makale Başlığı: Determination of Adult Parasitoids of Sunn pest Eurygaster spp. (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae) and their Parasitization Rates in Cereal Cultivation Areas in Iğdır and Neighboring Provinces
Özet: This study was conducted to determine parasitoid species identified from adults of Sunn pest Eurygaster spp.  (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), their distribution in populations and their parasitization rates on cereal cultivation areas in Ağrı, Erzurum, Iğdır, Kars and Van provinces in the years of 2015 and 2016. As a result of the study, Elomya lateralis (Meigen), Ectophasia oblonga (Robineau-Desvoidy) and Phasia subcoleoptrata (Linnaeus, 1767) species were identified as the adult Sunn pest Eurygaster species. The distribution of the species within the parasitoid population was recorded as 57 %E. lateralis, 23% P. subcoleoptrata and 20% E. oblonga. Among these species, E. lateralis was found to be common in Ağrı and Van, E. oblonga in Iğdır and Kars provinces, and P. subcoleoptrata in Erzurum. The total parasitization rate was 8.73%, 1.2% and 3.6%, respectively. in the overwintered adult Sunn pests collected in the cereal fields of Ağrı, Iğdır and Van provinces in 2015-2016, and 2.5% and 0.68%, respectively, in the adult Sunn pests collected in the cereal cultivation areas of Erzurum and Kars provinces in 2016. The highest parasitism rate was observed in Ağrı as 8.73%.

Makale Başlığı: The Understanding of Food Literacy in the Field of Tourism
Özet: While a significant portion of the world struggles with the challenges that come with being overweight, another large portion of the world searches for authentic cuisine that will make their holidays a memorable experience. This is where the importance of the concept of food literacy comes into play. It is necessary to reach and influence large communities to raise awareness of the society about food and nutrition. The purpose of this study is to uncover food literacy awareness and the meaning assigned to it in the tourism community by using a semi-structured interview form. The findings reveal that tourism stakeholders have a misunderstanding of food literacy. People who have heard this phrase previously are almost entirely wrong about its definition, but those who haven't heard it before can roughly anticipate its subheadings. However, all the participants believed that having detailed information about food and nutrition is essential.

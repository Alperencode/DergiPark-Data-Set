Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of the Researches on the Heavy Metal Contents of Bivalve Species on the Shores of the Dardanelles (Çanakkale) Strait Between 2000-2022
Özet: Monitoring physicochemical and biological parameters at regular intervals in marine ecosystems is necessary to protect water quality and prevent pollution. This study aims to review the scientific research articles published between 2000-2022 on the heavy metal contents of mollusc species in the Dardanelles region. Levels of heavy metals were also discussed for human consumption by comparing the existing data on edible tissues with various food codices to establish references for future studies in this region.

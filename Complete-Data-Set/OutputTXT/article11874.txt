Makale Başlığı: Reading Social Distancing for Syrian Migrants  from the   Academy: The Case of Turkey
Özet: Academics, one of the professional professions, consists of employees who specialize in different fields. Academics define and guide the society they live in as educators by training qualified personnel. However, academia is also affected by the realities of the country and the world. In this respect, the problems that Syrian immigrants face in adapting to Turkish society and the education system are worth examining from the perspective of academics. This study examines the willingness of academic staff working in Turkish universities to establish social relations with Syrian immigrants. Quantitative research techniques were used in the study, and data were gathered by questionnaire. Questions were prepared using a scale called Adaptation Perception to Daily Life and Emory S. Bogardus' Social Distance scale. The study revealed that academicians consider Syrian immigrants as the other in daily life and do not see any cultural ties with them. It has been revealed that academics are close to being in the same place and cooperating accordingly, but they are reluctant to share the same identity. Bununla birlikte akademisyenler, sağlanabilecek koşullarla Suriyelilerin Türk toplumuna adapte olabileceğini düşünmektedir. It has been concluded that among the academicians, those who have a cultural affinity with Syrians marginalize immigrants less.

Makale Başlığı: LINKING PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION WITH LEARNING IN THE INTER-ORGANISATIONAL CONTEXT
Özet: This research intends to contribute to investigations into innovation and inter-organizational learning as newly emerging fields in the public sector literature. Both concepts are considered as interrelated and sequential since innovations are disseminated via learning and learning mostly creates innovation. In this paper, a framework, which aims to improve both theoretical background and praxis on the subject, is propounded on the relationship between innovation and learning in the inter-organizational context. Within this typology, changes acquired within the organizations after the process of inter-organizational learning are divided into two categories, innovation and improvement, in parallel with inter-organizational learning being realized in three parts — collaboration, diffusion and knowledge transfer. Organizational capacity of the originating and recipient organizations are also seen at a level that is competent enough to handle the learning process to carry it out properly. Hence, the suggested framework puts forward four different variations for the public sector innovation and learning among the organizational relations: Innovation can be fully transferred, or it is partially transferred by reason of insufficient capacity of either originating or recipient organizations and become improvement at the end of these two processes or finally no innovation is adopted to the receiver organizations.

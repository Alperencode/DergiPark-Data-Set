Özet: Modern technology calls for a legal framework for the legal integrationof highly developed robots (autonomous robots-artificially intelligent robots)into our society. Because as a result of technological developments,artificially intelligent robots are used daily in many industries and byindividuals more and more. Since there is no special legal status provided forartificially intelligent robots, it has become a necessity to regulate legalsystems according to developments in artificial intelligence technology. Howthe legal status of this robots should be regulated is one of the mostdiscussed topics in scientific studies on the subject. One of the views putforward in the doctrine on this subject is that artificially intelligent robots areaccepted as electronic persons. However, granting legal personhood(electronic personhood) to robots for determining rights and responsibilitiesof these entities could cause some problems. Get the advantage of theinstitution of slavery while determining the legal status of artificiallyintelligent robots is another view put forward on this issue. In this respect,legal status of Roman slaves and specially the concept of peculium could bean alternative legal remedy.

Makale Başlığı: Did Ibn Sherīf really make use of the treatise of Surgeon Meḥmed in his Yadigār? On a methodological problem with the publication of manuscripts
Özet: Object: To determine whether Surgeon Meḥmed’s treatise on medicine is used as one of the sources in Ibn Sherīf’s Yādigār and to draw attention to the importance of preparing a critical edition during the publication of manuscripts.Materials and Methods: Surgeon Meḥmed’s treatise on medicine in İBB, Atatürk Library, OE_Yz_K0827, the printed copy of Ibn Şherīf’s Yadigār published by Merkezefendi Traditional Medicine Association and different manuscripts of Yadigār were examined. The relevant parts of the works of Jurcānī named Yād-gār and Khuffay ʿAlāʾī are also reviewed.Results: Surgeon Meḥmed’s treatise on medicine is almost exactly found in the relevant part of the printed edition of Ibn Sherīf’s Yādigār. On the other hand, in earlier manuscripts of Yādigār, the relevant chapter is shorter and different, and this chapter is very similar to the chapters in Yād-gār and Khuffay ʿAlāʾī of Jurjānī. In this context, it seems possible to say that Surgeon Meḥmed basically benefited from the relevant parts of Ibn Sherīf’s Yādigār and indirectly from Jurjānī’s Yād-gār, and he probably added the chapter(s) that he had quoted from another source(s) to his treatise. It is also noticed that while Ibn Sherif’s Yādigār was being copied by different scribes, a second version appeared, and in this version, Surgeon Meḥmed’s treatise on medicine may have been added to the relevant section.Conclusion: While preparing his Yādigār, Ibn Sherīf translated the part of Jurjanī’s Yād-gār titled “About the fracture, contusion and dislocated joint” into his work. On the other hand, in the manuscript of Topkapı Revan 1684 of Yādigār, it is seen that instead of the part translated by Ibn Sherīf, Surgeon Meḥmed’s treatise prepared with various additions to Ibn Sherīf’s writings was included. This finding indicates that there may be two different versions of Ibn Sherif’s Yādigār. For this reason, it is of great importance to prepare and publish a critical edition by considering the different copies of the manuscript.

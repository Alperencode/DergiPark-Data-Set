Makale Başlığı: A novel intramedullary nail in the treatment of supramalleolar malunion and nonunion,a preliminary report of three cases
Özet: The fractures around the supramalleolar region is difficult and deformities may occur due to insufficient or inadequate treatment attempts. The treatment of those deformities are even more challenging. The available options for surgical fixation has inherent problems considering the soft tissue problems, infection and compliance of the patients. Three patients with supramalleolar deformities were recruited for this study. Two patients had periarticular distal tibia malunions and one patient had nonunion in same region. All patients were operated with using newly designed intramedullary nail system with a unique distal interlocking bolt screw. The outcome for each patient was followed-up and evaulated with using AOFAS score. In our patient series, adequate fixation following correction of the deformity was seen. Although the number of the cases are limited, regarding the encouraging results, we report the preliminary outcome of new IMN system in use of supramalleolar deformities. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0257This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

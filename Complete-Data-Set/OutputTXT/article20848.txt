Makale Başlığı: Comparison of input modes: L2 comprehension and cognitive load
Özet: The current study investigated L2-based assumptions of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and Cognitive Load Theory for the multimedia, modality, and redundancy principles.  In this non-equivalent groups quasi-experimental design study, four groups of Turkish-speaking teacher trainees of the English language received a 12-minute non-paced lesson on harp seal pups that included English audio (audio group), English audio with video (video + audio group), English captions with video (video + text group), and English audio with video and captions (video + audio + text group). A comprehension test as well as measures for difficulty and effort rating were used to collect data. One-way between-groups analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to determine the effects of different modes of presentation on participants’ learning performance and cognitive load. Moreover, Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) tests were performed to determine the groups that differed from each other. The findings showed that the video + audio group performed better and reported less difficulty and effort expenditure in the foreign/second language (L2) listening comprehension task than the audio-only group. On the other hand, the video + text and video + audio groups did not differ with respect to comprehension, difficulty, and effort expenditure. Lastly, while the video + audio + text and video + audio groups performed equally well in the comprehension task, the video + audio + text group reported less difficulty and effort than the video + audio group.  The results and possible venues for further research were discussed.

Makale Başlığı: Impact of Economic Growth, Technological Innovation, and Globalization on Environmental Degradation in an Emerging Market
Özet: This current study reveals a new understanding of the dynamic impact of globalization, technological innovation, economic growth on environmental degradation in South Africa by utilizing innovative analyses. This research applied wavelet-based techniques for datasets between 1980 and 2017. The empirical outcomes establish proof of a connection between CO2 emissions (CO2E) and technological innovation, economic growth, and globalization over time and frequency. Additionally, from the viewpoint of frequency-domain, this paper shows impressive wavelet coherence and robust lead/lag interaction. The empirical findings indicate that technological innovation, globalization, and economic growth depreciate the level of environmental quality in South Africa in the short and medium-term. The findings highlight the importance of having coordinated policies by lawmakers and government officials to prevent environmental degradation that has taken place in South Africa for many decades.

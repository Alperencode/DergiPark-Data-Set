Makale Başlığı: One of the Last Victims of the Soviet Courts: Ekmel İkramov (1899-1938)
Özet: History sometimes misremembers important figures. Ekmel İkramov is remembered almost only for his trial in spurious courts in 1938, not for the role he played in the Uzbek SSR or the representations he made in the history of Turkestan in particular. Ekmel İkramov, who advanced to the position of the First Clerk of the Central Committee of the National Party among the Turkistan is, was accused of accusations such as "bourgeois nationalist" and "enemy of the people" in the Soviet courts, which is known as the "Great Cleansing" in history and was tried and executed in this court. In the 20th year of the Bolshevik dictatorship, many secret and open courts, very harsh judgments and deaths were passed in most of the Soviet countries, in Turkestan. Between 1936 and 1939, the terror of mass arrests and executions by the secret police agency NKVD resulted in the detention of 7-8 million people in Soviet society. About 3 million of them were shot or died, unable to withstand the pressure. The population in prison and remote camps had reached 9 million in 1939. It was during these years that the Prime Minister of the Uzbek SSR Feyzullah Hocayev (1896-1938) and the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan Ekmel Ikramov (1898-1938) were accused of being "bourgeois nationalists", "national fascists", "anti-revolutionaries" and "anti-Sovietists". Many intellectuals and statesmen, including. Many of them were brought to false courts and tried for false crimes and sentenced to death. This study constitutes the third of our studies titled "Fake Courts and the Great Purge Period in Soviet Turkestan" and "Final Purge: Feyzullah Hocayev in the Soviet Court (1896-1938)". In our study, the interrogation process of Ekmel İkramov, who was sentenced to death in these hearings held in Moscow on March 2, 1938 and known as the "Court of the 21s" and also known as the "Fake Courts" in history, will be evaluated through the original documents.

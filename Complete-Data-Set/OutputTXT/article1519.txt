Makale Başlığı: The Analysis of the World's Most Dangerous Nuclear Plant from the Standpoint of the Most Air-Polluted City  in Europe
Özet: As a prominent item on the agenda of Turkish-Armenian relations from time to time, the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, located in the town of Metsamor in Armenia, has become an even more critical issue after the earthquakes in and around the region. The closest settlement to this nuclear power plant in the region is Iğdır. The people of Iğdır, who have current concerns about the power plant, have a different point of view towards the power plant. This study has examined the working principles and risks of nuclear power plants -which are usually seen as a clean energy source- and tried to clarify the misconceptions. Iğdır Province was the most air-polluted city in Europe in 2021. This situation has also caused the local people to establish a relationship between air pollution and the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant. In particular, cancer cases caused by air pollution have been attributed to Metsamor, which does not contribute to air pollution; and this power plant has been seen as a cause of air pollution. This study explains primary reason for this misconception is the relevant public institutions' insufficient information to society despite the deputies' parliamentary questions submitted to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.

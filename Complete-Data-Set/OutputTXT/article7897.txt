Makale Başlığı: PID Control Medium Size Wind Turbine Control with Integrated Blade Pitch Angle
Özet: Due to the increase in electricity consumption in the world, the tendency to increase resource diversity in the electricity generation section has increased. With the decrease in the reserves of petroleum and derivative products used in traditional energy production systems, energy production has turned to renewable energy sources. Examples of renewable energy sources are the sun, wind turbines, and fuel cells. In order to provide sustainable energy production in wind turbines, the blades and body must be protected. In this study, the blade pitch angle control of the wind turbine is realized with the PID controller and the wind turbine is protected from high speeds. The coefficient control of the PID controller is determined by the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and Ziegler Nichols method. Simulation was carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment. It has been observed that the PID coefficient parameters optimized with PSO in the pitch angle control process reach the reference power value in a shorter time compared to the PID parameter values calculated with Ziegler Nichols. In addition, it was observed that the oscillation value was less at the reference power reached and the pitch angle increased.

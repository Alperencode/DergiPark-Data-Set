Makale Başlığı: Secularıty Scale Valıdıty and Relıabılıty Study
Özet: In this study, a measurement tool consisting of 26 items was developed to measure the understanding of secularity of individuals belonging to the Y and Z generations. The working group consists of 274 people from the Y and Z generations. In the study, some analyses that will prove the validity and reliability of the secularity scale are included. For the construct validity of the scale, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and content validity were used. As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, it was determined that the scale was gathered under a single factor and explained 60,764% of the variance. The Cronbach alpha value for the whole scale was determined as 0.909. This situation shows that the reliability of the scale created is high. The item-total correlation coefficients of the scale range between 0.40-0.80. There are 14 reverse items and 12 plain items in this scale. While the maximum score obtainable is 130, the minimum score obtainable is 26 points. Scores close to 130 show that the person is secular in the Islamic sense, while scores close to 26 show that the person is not secular in the Islamic sense. The results of the validity and reliability analysis show that the scale can be used to measure the understanding of secularity of individuals from the Y and Z generations.

Makale Başlığı: Analyzing Of Data Protection Impact Assessment As A Compliance Instrument In Terms Of Turkish Law
Özet: Data protection regulations are closely related to the management of risks that may arise in terms of natural persons, especially in the face of developing technologies such as artificial intelligence technologies, and the protection of their fundamental rights and freedoms. Under the European Union data protection law, the principle of accountability and numerous compliance instruments are adopted in order to prevent the risks posed by personal data processing from the design stage. Among these instruments, data protection impact assessment, which is considered specific and functional for determining and preventing risks, draws attention. Turkish data protection law also needs to be developed by considering the new risks and threats that may arise in the future depending on the advancing technologies. It is expected that the principle of accountability and compliance instruments will also be regulated in Turkish law with the updates to be made in the Personal Data Protection Law No. 6698 in line with the General Data Protection Regulation. In this article, the purpose, scope, application of data protection impact assessment and its relationship with the principle of accountability are examined. Following, this practice is analyzed in terms of Turkish law and it was considered in which aspects it would be beneficial to be regulated in our legislation.

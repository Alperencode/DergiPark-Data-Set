Makale Başlığı: MENTAL VERBS IN AHTIILAR THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF SAHA (YAKUT) WRITTEN LITERATURE
Özet: All actions that are the results of mental processes are called mental verbs. Because mental verbs are associated with human mental activities. Although the first studies on mental verbs have been conducted in psychology, currently, mental verbs are investigated in the fields of linguistics and Turcology. These studies mostly aimed to determine the boundaries of mental verbs, identify various sub-types, and classification and exemplification of mental verbs.Ahtıılar is the first written work in Yakut literature. It is a memoir, written by A. Y. Uvarovsky, and was based on the author's childhood memories. In addition to being the first literary piece in Yakut, it is also important in terms of the valuable information it provides about the Saha culture and folklore. In the current article, mental verbs in Ahtıılar were identified and classified as sensory verbs, cognitive verbs and expressive verbs based on the input, process and output stages.

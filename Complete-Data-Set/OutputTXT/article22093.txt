Makale Başlığı: Comparison of the Effects of Medetomidine/Ketamine and Xylazine/Ketamine Anesthesia and Its Reversal by Atipamezole on Cardiovascular Functions in Cats
Özet: The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term cardiovascular effects of medetomidine/ketamine (MED-KET) and xylazine/ketamine (XYZ-KET) anesthesia regimes and its reversal (atipamezole) in cats through using echocardiography. Twenty sexually intact female cats (weighing between 2.2 and 3.6 kg, and between 0.5 and 5.5 years of age) referred for ovariohysterectomy procedure. Electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate and pulse oximetry were monitored throughout the anesthesia. Both groups showed declines in left ventricular diameter (LVD%) and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) after anesthesia induction (T0 vs. T1, all, p<0.05); nevertheless, the reduction and starting pattern of LVD% and left ventricular EF presented important intergroup distinction. In conclusion, echocardiographic values effected significantly after anesthesia with MED-KET and XYZ-KET; and atipamezole can be useful for return to baseline values quickly and safely in cats after abdominal surgery such as ovariohysterectomy.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of R&D Expenditures and Number of Patents on Employment in Turkiye: An Evaluation with the ARDL Analysis
Özet: Unemployment is one of the important macroeconomic problems all over the world. As a matter of fact, employment is one of the most important targets in macroeconomics. For this reason, countries implement various policies in line with the goal of reaching the employment level closest to full employment. The diversity of the instruments preferred while the said policies are being implemented and the content of the investments made in reaching the target are extremely important. Recently, investments in research and development (R&D) expenditures have been increasing rapidly in all countries. At the same time, the total number of patents in countries tends to increase. The aforementioned increases, which are considered as the key to technological development, reveal positive economic statements. In this context, this study examines the relationship between R&D expenditures and total number of patents and employment. In this study, in which 2000-2020 annual data for Turkey are used, whether the series are stationary or not has been determined by traditional unit root tests. After the stationarity determination of the series, the autoregressive distributed lag model ARDL test was performed. According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that there is a cointegration effect between the variables of R&D expenditures and number of patents and employment variable in Turkey. According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that a 1% increase in R&D expenditures reduces employment rates by 0.72%, while a 1% unit increase in the total number of patents increases employment rates by 0.04%.

Makale Başlığı: Calligrapher Ahmed Rıf'at Efendi's Script Moulds of the Tahir Baba Dervish Lodge and Masjid Inscription
Özet: The 19th century, which was turbulent in the social and political fields, but experienced such positive developments in the art life, appears as the age of reforms in all aspects of life in the Ottoman Empire. Important artists in terms of Islamic calligraphy were educated in this period and the evolutionary movements that affected the next ages were realized. However, sharp events such as the abolition of the Janissary Corps and the abolition of Bektashism as a result also occurred in this period. Tahir Baba Dervish Lodge, which was demolished in the events of 1826 after being founded at the end of the 18th century and reopened in the 1860s and was completely erased from the scene of history after 1925, is one of the structures that witnessed these periods. Today, only a small burial ground of the lodge remains. The inscription moulds written by Ahmed Rıf'at Efendi, a calligrapher of the period, are like a document about the existence and adventure of the dervish lodge. Although the building and inscription do not exist today, its text has survived. The inscription moulds in Konya Regional Manuscripts Library BY8363 carry the information about the period and the work in which it was written, as well as about the calligrapher and artistic power. In the study, the inscription text of Rıf'at Efendi's Tahir Baba Dervish Lodge and Masjid was examined in terms of calligraphy and content. While the text of the inscription shows the talent of the calligrapher within the framework of the art of writing, it confirms the dates, names and the information about the dervish lodge and carries it to the present day.

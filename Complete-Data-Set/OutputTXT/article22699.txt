Makale Başlığı: Tourism Resources of The District of Görele

One of these areas is the Görele district, which has natural loadstones in addition to historical-cultural monuments that belong to many civilisations. It also has a high tourism potential thanks to its geographical location as well as its existing natural and cultural attractions. However, this potential is not so much known. Undoubtedly, this situation was caused by the lack of infrastructure services along with the fact that local attractions were not sufficiently presented.

In this regard, observation and interview techniques (semi-structured and unstructured interview techniques), data obtained from institutions, and such studies as articles and books written about the subject were used as data collection methods in this study. Accordingly, suggestions have been made for the development of tourism types by being proved the local attractions.

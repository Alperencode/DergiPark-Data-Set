Makale Başlığı: The place of violence among the factors affecting the branch preferences of specialization students
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the violence experiences in healthcare of the physicians who get specialty training in medicine at Ege University Faculty of Medicine, on their choice of specialization.Materials and Methods: It was determined that there were 704 resident physicians working at the Ege University Faculty of Medicine. Between 25.05.2020 and 25.03.2021, 394 of them were reached and face-to-face survey was applied to them. A total of 389 questionnaires were evaluated. Data were analyzed with the IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 Program. Pearson Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was performed for comparisons with more than two groups. P-value less than 0.05 was evaluated as statistically significant.Results: 51.7% of the participants were male and 48.1% were female. It was determined that 54.5% of all physicians were exposed to violence before specialty training in medicine, and 76.9% of them witnessed violence. It was found that witnessing violence in healthcare was significantly effective in choosing a specialty (p=0.005). It was determined that participants in basic sciences gave more priority to factors related to violence for selection of specialty (p<0.001). It was determined that physicians who were exposed violence and witnessed violence in the institution where they work had thoughts for changing their specialty as statistically significant (p=0.002, p=0.014, respectively). In addition, it was determined that 22.9% of the participants wanted different occupation other than the medical profession.Conclusion: Eliminating the problems in the health system, educating the society, using the media effectively and the deterrent decisions taken by the judicial institutions are very important for preventing violence in healthcare.

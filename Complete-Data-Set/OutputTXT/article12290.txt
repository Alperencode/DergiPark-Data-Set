Makale Başlığı: Is Idioptahic Osteosclerosis Associated with Bruxism? Clinico-Radiological Evaluation
Özet: Aim: Idiopathic osteosclerosis (IO) of the jaws are non-expansive localized radiopacities. These lesions are usually asymptomatic and are detected incidentally on radiographs taken for other reasons. Although the etiology of IO is unclear, it has been reported that occlusal forces may lead to bone deposition. The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of IO in the jaw bones in bruxist and non-bruxist individuals.Material and Methods: In this study, who applied to the Dentomaxillofacial Radiology clinic for diagnosis and treatment needs and volunteered to participate in the study, whose panoramic radiographs were taken for these purposes, were examined. Only individuals with IO were included in the study. The diagnosis of bruxism in clinical examination was recorded. SPSS v.21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) program was used in the analysis of the data.Results: 91 patients with IO (52 females and 39 males) in the jaw were studied. The age range was 16-71 and the mean age was 34±14 years. While 37 patients with IO (41%) were bruxist, 54 patients (59%) were non-bruxists.Conclusion: IO can be seen in both bruxist and non-bruxist patients, and IO is more common in non-bruxist patients. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate individual differences such as unilateral chewing or premature tooth contact.

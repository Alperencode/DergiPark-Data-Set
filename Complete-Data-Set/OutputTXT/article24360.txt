Makale Başlığı: Examination of Science Education Curriculum (5-8 grades) in terms of Entrepreneurial Characteristics
Özet: The pupose of this study was toinvestigate acquisitions, textbooks and workbookactivities located in the science curriculum for 5-8 grades, in terms ofentrepreneurial characteristics. This has been designed as a qualitativeresearch study from data obtained via course documents, composed from textbooks and workbooks.The results show that the fifth grade science curriculum included moreacquisitions related to entrepreneurial characteristics, according to othercurriculums. However, it has been determined that the number of fifth gradeacquisitions, like taking risks, teamwork, using time well and adapting tochange, that would enable the improvement of their entrepreneurialcharacteristics, were quite small. When they looked at textbook acitivities, itwas seen that there was no activity for improving the enabling characteristicsof students, such as taking risks and adapting to change. Moreover, it wasfound that textbook acitivities are insufficient in terms of characteristics,like being innovative, to use the time well, to provide for actingindependently. On the other hand, it was determined that throughworkbook activities are aimed at improving the creativity of students. Also, asmall part of the workbook activities considered characteristics, like seeingopportunities, being innovative and self-confident. The biggest deficiency inthe workbook activities is not taking into account characteristics, such astaking risks, using time well, teamwork, effective communication and adaptingto change. It is thought that these results will shed light on curriculumdevelopment studies planned to be built after the 2013 science curriculum.

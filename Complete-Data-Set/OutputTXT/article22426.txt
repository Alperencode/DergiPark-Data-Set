Makale Başlığı: Unique and Unusual: The Martin Brothers and Their Ceramics
Özet: The Martin Brothers are a family that lived in England in the 19th century and are known for their original grotesque ceramic works and a business known by their names. The lives of the Martin Brothers, the functioning of their studio, and the increasingly unique style of their artworks have caused them to be remembered at a different point than other studios and artists producing in the same period. Even though the artworks of the Martin Brothers attracted the attention of buyers and collectors at that time, with the effect of getting rid of the aesthetic concerns of the period they lived in, their unique social behaviors, and health problems, they did not get the appreciation they deserved. Despite this, they are considered to be the pioneers of Art Pottery and therefore contemporary ceramic art with their style and unique design concepts that transform functional objects into grotesque sculptures without losing their function. The aim of the research is to discuss the ceramic production adventure of the Martin Brothers in the context of their unique styles, different current events and the creation processes fed by art disciplines, and to reveal the contributions of the Martin Brothers to contemporary ceramic art. The descriptive design model was used in the research. Nine artworks, including the three chronological phases of the Martin Brothers’ art, constitute the sample of the study. The artworks were analyzed using the content analysis method. As a result of the study, it has been found that the Martin Brothers' artworks and business model have contributed to contemporary ceramic art beyond what is mentioned in the literature.

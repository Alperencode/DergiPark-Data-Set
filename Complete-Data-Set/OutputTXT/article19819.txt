Makale Başlığı: ADOLESCENTS VANDALISM SCALE: ITS DEVELOPMENT, VALIDITY, RELIABILITY
Özet: The purpose of this study was to develop a scale intended for measuring the vandalism levels of adolescents (high school students) who demonstrate vandalist behaviours. The sample of this study consists of 600 high school students who are attending public high schools. “Adolescents Vandalism Scale”, which was developed by the researchers of this study, was used as data collection tool. Means, standard deviations, and cronbach-alpha values of the items were calculated. A three (3) factor scale was obtained as a result of the conducted exploratory factor analysis. In the exploratory factor analysis, total correlations of the items constituting the vandalism scale varied in the interval of .410 and .836 while factor loads of items varied between .489 and .813. Reliability level of the research scale was calculated and the internal coefficient of consistency (Cronbach-alpha) of the whole scale was found as .969. Every statement in the survey was rated with a 5 point Likert scale, as 1 being lowest (never) and 5 being highest (always). The lowest point a person can get is 37 and the highest is 185 on the scale. The higher the point a person scores in the scale, the more he/she demonstrates vandalist behaviours..

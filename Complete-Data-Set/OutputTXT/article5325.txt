Makale Başlığı: The Relationships between Academic Achievement, Awareness about the Postgraduate Study and Postgraduate Study Intention of Theological Students
Özet: This study aims to examine the relationships between academic achievement, awareness about the postgraduate study and postgraduate study intention of theological students. In order to analyze these relationships, the study was designed in the causal survey model. The obtained data were tested with a multiple linear regression model. The sample of the research consisted of 273 theology students from 5 universities studying in the 2021-2022 academic year. In the analysis of the data, there was no significant relationship between the academic achievement of theological students and their awareness of postgraduate education, and there was a low-level significant correlation between their academic study and their postgraduate study intentions (r=.13; p<.05). On the other hand, it was found that there was a medium correlation (r=.71; p<.01) between awareness about the postgraduate study and postgraduate study intention of theological students. In the regression analysis, in which the model established in the study was tested, it was observed that the academic achievements of theological students and their awareness about the postgraduate study predicted their postgraduate study intentions at a high level and significantly (R=.725, R2= .525, p<.001). As a result, it can be said that the model tested in the study was confirmed; as awareness about the postgraduate study of theological students increases, their graduate education intentions will also increase, and academic success will also have a small effect on this.

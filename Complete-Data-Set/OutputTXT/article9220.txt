Makale Başlığı: The Location of the Mandibular Foramen as a Guide in Mandibular Block Anesthesia in Children by Age: A Radiographic Analysis
Özet: Knowing the correct location of the mandibular foramen (MF) is a significant factor in the success of inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). The primary clinical guide for this anesthesia  in children with continued growth and development may be the location of MF. The present study was carried out retrospectively on panoramic radiographs of children aged 5-14 years. Three linear measurements were performed on panoramic radiographs to evaluate the distance of the MF to the occlusal plane (OP), anterior border of the ramus (ABR), and mandibular base (MB). The participants’ ages were divided into five groups: (G1) 5-6 years, (G2) 7-8 years, (G3) 9-10 years, (G4) 11-12 years, and (G5) 13-14 years. The results revealed a statistically significant increase in the mean values from G2 to G4 in all measurements. However, it was determined that there were no statistically significant differences between G1 and G2 and between G4 and G5 by the mean measurement values, respectively. Besides, the results of the measurements did not significantly differ by sex.  Overall, it was concluded that MF was slightly below OP under 8 years of age and moves in the posterosuperior direction until the permanent dentition period. This result may guide clinicians in IANB in children.

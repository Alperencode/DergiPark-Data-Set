Makale Başlığı: The Rules of Preference Regarding the Recourse of Pronouns in the Qur'an in the Context of Hüseyn al-Harbî's Ḳavâ'idü't-Tercîḥ 'İnde'l-Müfessirîn
Özet: Pronouns play an important role in briefly conveying the message to the addressee. They also play an important role in avoiding word repetition. For this reason, it is widely used in Arabic. Since pronouns are expressions that replace other entities, first of all, it is necessary to know these entities called recourse. The recourses of the pronouns belonging to the first and second person or persons are always clear. In the case of third-person or personal pronouns, knowing them depends on some criteria. In his work Ḳavâ'idü't-tercîḥ 'inde'l-müfessirîn, Hüseyn al-Harbî compiled some important preference rules in terms of determining the recourses of pronouns on the basis of the Qur'an. He synthesized them from some linguistic determinations of the Arabic language experts and some interpretations of the commentators on the ayat. Therefore, we preferred to deal with the subject in the context of the aforementioned work. In this study, we first explained the types of pronouns and their recourses in Arabic. Then we introduced the mentioned work. Afterwards, we explained the preference rules related to the recourses of the pronouns with different views and examples. Our aim in this is to contribute to the understanding of the Qur'an, even to a small extent. Therefore, we can say that our study is important.

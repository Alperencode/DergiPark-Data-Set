Makale Başlığı: The Principles Derived from the Experiences in Assesment of Witness Statements in Turkish and German Civil Procedural Law
Özet: In Turkish and German Civil Procedural Law, the judge is not completely free to assess the evidences. The laws of nature and logic as well asthe principles derived from the experiences limits the principle of free appraisal of evidences. The restricted capacity of human senses and the difficulties in perceiving, remembering things seen and heard objectively andcompletely reflecting them make the assessment of witness evidence,which is the most frequent, but the most unreliable evidence among allevidences, complicated. In order to overcome these difficulties, the Turkish and German judges tend to create new rules of evidences. In thiswork, the rules defined as the principles derived from the experiences andnot stipulated in law and their legal nature are explained. In this context,the potential solution recommendations are expressed in the conclusionpart of the work.

Makale Başlığı: Sexual Problems in Pregnancy and Current Midwifery Approach
Özet: Sexuality, which is in the first step of Maslow's basic human needs, has an important place in the lives of individuals. In some stages of the basic life cycle, many changes are experienced in the physiology of sexual act. One of these stages is pregnancy. In a healthy ongoing pregnancy, your sexuality can continue without restrictions. Maintaining sexual activity during pregnancy enables couples to get closer to each other and the pregnant woman to feel physically and psychologically comfortable. However, sexual act during pregnancy is a situation that is avoided due to many factors. Couples restrict sexual activity for fear of harming the fetus during sexual activity. However, in this process, couples experience the dilemma of being sexually active in order to maintain a healthy marital relationship. It is important for pregnant women to get counseling from midwives so that they can cope with sexual problems. However, it is emphasized in the literature that health professionals have problems in providing sexual counseling. This review has been prepared in order for midwives to identify and solve sexual problems experienced during pregnancy, to provide sexual health counseling according to their needs, and to develop an up-to-date midwifery approach.

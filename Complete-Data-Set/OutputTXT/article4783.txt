Makale Başlığı: OPINIONS OF PRESCHOOL TEACHER CANDIDATES ABOUT CODING
Özet: As in every field, computer-based environment-tools and materials are an inevitable part of learning and teaching in every level and type of education, including early childhood. It is possible to create products and services with coding to be done using advanced programming languages, as well as coding techniques that are simple to use for teaching children in education in early childhood education institutions. In this way, it is possible for children to realize what they want as a producer not only as a consumer, but with a more permanent learning. At the same time, learning of coding techniques for preschool teachers to use in the education of children in these age slices will make the education more participatory, collaborative, effective and successful. The “coding skills” that preschool teacher candidates will have will provide important benefits in their professional development.

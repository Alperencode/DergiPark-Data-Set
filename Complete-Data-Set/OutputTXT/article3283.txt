Makale Başlığı: The Head of a Woman from the South Stoa in the Sanctuary of Artemis from Magnesia ad Maeandrum
Özet: It is understood that a marble of a female head found during excavations in the South Stoa of the Sanctuary of Magnesia Artemis was planned and shaped as a head of a female statue in a mantle, with traces of the mantle fabric preserved on its upper and lateral parts, and it was then reworked. The facial features of the Magnesia head show an ideal typology rather than a portrait. The typological and stylistic features of the work were compared in detail with examples from the Hellenistic Period found in the geography of Magnesia and the settlements associated with it in two different ways. The Head of Magnesia is a part of the Portrait Sculpture tradition of the Woman in Mantle, which became widespread in the Aegean Islands and Western Anatolia from the middle of the IInd century B.C., and was erected in the Agora of Magnesia as a votive or honoring statue at the end of the IInd century B.C. or the beginning of the Ist century B.C. It was a statue of a veiled woman. Later, the head should have been reworked and placed inside the mantle on the body of a female statue in pudicitia pose, to be seen from the front, as in Saufeia, Baebia and other examples in Magnesia. The Early Imperial Period, reached as a result of the stylistic evaluation, is also supported by the architectural features of the buildings thought to be related in the South Stoa, where the work was located.

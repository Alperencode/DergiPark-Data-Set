Makale Başlığı: Travel agencies’ role in gastronomy tourism development and a gastronomy tour example
Özet: Gastronomy tourism embraces a wide range of gastronomic opportunities for tourists while contributing to sustainability, rural development and the protection of culinary heritage. It diversifies and revitalizes tourism as one of the industry's  essential element and emerging segments. However, there is a scarcity of research on the issue related to  travel agencies. The purpose of this research is to determine whether travel agencies in İzmir use culinary elements and gastronomic sources as themes in their tour packages to highlight the gastronomy tourism potential of the city, and explore ways of developing this approach. Thus, the contribution of this study is threefold. First, travel agencies in downtown İzmir were surveyed in terms of their actual gastronomy tourism product offers and future plans to create one. The survey results revealed that gastronomy was not promoted as a principal theme due to a lack of awareness of potential local and regional culinary resources. Second, experts in the gastronomy and tourism industries were contacted using purposive sampling. Their opinions were sought regarding  places, products and activities that could be included in a gastronomy tour package. Finally, an example tour program was created based on expert opinions along with the author’s contribution.

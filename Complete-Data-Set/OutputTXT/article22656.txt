Makale Başlığı: The Pragmatist Axis in China’s Asian-Pacific Foreign Policy: From Precaution to Self-Confidence
Özet: In this study, China's Asia-Pacific foreign policy has been examined, taking into account the process from 1978, when China's economic reform process and Open Door policy began, to 2008, when it hosted the Olympics. Answers were sought to questions such as what kind of foreign policy concept China acts on in the Asia-Pacific region, how ideological and pragmatist approaches affect Chinese foreign policy, and what are the reflections of the changes and transformations in Chinese domestic policy on foreign policy. In this sense, first, the transformations in Chinese domestic policy during the Deng Xiaoping period were revealed, and then the reflections of these transformations on foreign policy were mentioned. In the last chapter, China's relations with the Asia-Pacific countries were examined. Theoretically, neo-classical realism was used, and the effects of changes in China's domestic policy on Chinese foreign policy and the structure of the global system were discussed through neo-classical realism.

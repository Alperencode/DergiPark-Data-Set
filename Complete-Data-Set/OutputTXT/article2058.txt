Makale Başlığı: NOTES ON THE NEVA YAHUD SEDA-YI ERMENİYAN NEWSPAPER
Özet: The press, which has an important role in the transition from the traditional world to the modern world, found its application area among the minorities before the Turks in the Ottoman Empire. The declaration of the Second Constitutional Monarchy caused a press explosion both in quantity and quality throughout the country. Neva yahud Seda-yı Ermeniyan is one of the newspapers that has a special place in the Armenian press, which has started to experience its brightest days since 1909. The most basic feature of Neva newspaper, which was published by Mihran Apigyan, an Armenian who believes in Ottoman thought, or Mihran Mihri, as he used it in the newspaper, is that it tells the Armenian theses to the Ottomans in Ottoman letters. In this article, the first 14 issues of the newspaper Neva yahud Seda-yı Armenianyan, which had two issues so far, will be discussed as a whole (13th issue is missing in the collection).Through the pages of the Neva newspaper, the effort of an Ottoman Armenian to give a message to the Ottoman State and to the Armenians in the Ottoman State -both a stimulant and a defender-will be revealed.

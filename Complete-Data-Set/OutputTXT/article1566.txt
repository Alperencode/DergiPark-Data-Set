Makale Başlığı: THE COMPARISON OF VOLATILE COMPONENTS OF AJUGA ORIENTALIS L. COLLECTED FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN TURKEY
Özet: Objective: This study aimed to determine and compare the volatile compositions of A. orientalis collected from Antalya, Balıkesir, Erzurum, and Samsun in Turkey.        Material and Method: Microdistilled volatile samples of A. orientalis were determined by GC-FID and GC-MS systems simultaneously.        Result and Discussion: o-Cresol is also present in the volatiles of three provinces (except Erzurum province) as a common main compound. The main compounds of the volatiles were methyl hexadecanoate (15.8%), linalool (11.4%) and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (9.0%) for Erzurum province; o-cresol (43.7%), methyl oleate (10.1%) and methyl linoleate (9.1%) for Samsun province; o-cresol (75.2%) for Antalya province; hexadecanoic acid (20.3%), o-cresol (10.8%) and dihydroactinidiolide (10.8%) for Balıkesir province. The samples are rich in fatty acid+esters in all localities, except Erzurum province.

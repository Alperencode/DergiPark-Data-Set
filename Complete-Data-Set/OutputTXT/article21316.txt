Özet: The research aimed to assess the effects of methyl jasmonate (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mM MeJA) on weight loss and phytochemical compounds of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa cv. ‘Hayward’) throughout the cold storage and shelf life. Kiwifruits were stored at 0 ± 0.5 °C and 90 ± 5% RH for 180 days, and at 20 ± 1.0 °C and 80 ± 5% RH for 5 days in shelf life conditions. During cold storage, weight loss was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in 0.25 and 1.0 mM MeJA treatments than those of control and 0.5 mM MeJA treatments. The highest flesh firmness was determined in MeJA-treated fruits. In the latest measurement period of cold storage and shelf life, the lowest respiration rate was obtained from 0.5 and 1.0 mM MeJA treatments. MeJA-treated fruits had significantly higher hue angle at the end of cold storage. Generally, in shelf life analysis, acidity of MeJA-treated fruits was significantly lower than that of control fruits. At the end of cold storage, the highest vitamin C, total flavonoids, and antioxidant activity (DPPH) were measured in 1.0 mM MeJA treatment, whereas the highest total phenolics were detected in 0.25 mM MeJA treatment. Present findings revealed that MeJA could be used as an effective postharvest tool to maintain flesh firmness and phytochemical compounds of kiwifruits.

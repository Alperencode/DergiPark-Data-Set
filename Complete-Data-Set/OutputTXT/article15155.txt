Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Istanbul Airport's Multiple Parallel Runway Configurations in Terms of Time and Fuel Consumption
Özet: The need for airports is increasing day by day with growing air traffic demand. In order to meet this need, while examining how the existing airports can be used more effectively, new runways or airports are built in cities with a demand above their capacity. In recent years, newly built airports are designed to meet the intense demand that will occur in the future by using multiple parallel runway systems. There are many studies that show that runway configurations have a large impact on capacity in multiple parallel runway systems. In this study, the runway configurations of Istanbul Airport, which ranks first in the list of the busiest airports in 2021 according to the Airports Council International (ACI) data, which was opened in 2018 from the perspective of the airline companies, are evaluated in terms of time and fuel from the perspective of the airline operator. In the study, the runway configurations were examined by evaluating the landing runway, aircraft type and taxi times information of the traffic landing at Istanbul Airport. As a result of the study, runway configurations that provide minimum taxi time and fuel consumption were determined.

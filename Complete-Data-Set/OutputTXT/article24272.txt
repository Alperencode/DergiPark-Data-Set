Makale Başlığı: The Giant Cell Tumor of the Proximal Phalanx of the Thumb Treated by a 2-Stage Operation
Özet: The case shows a 29-year-old woman who was treated for a giant-cell tumour of her thumb. Surgical treatment was performed in two stages. In the first stage, the tumour was removed and the first metacarpal and distal phalanges were fixed by an external fixator. In the second stage of reconstruction of the thumb, a cortico-cancellous bone graft from the iliac crest, an external fixator and double arthrodesis were used. The two stages of the surgical procedures provide the possibility for confirming the diagnosis and eliminating incorrect diagnoses; they also confirmation the application of the radical method. This technique minimizes the risk of recurrence. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0185This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

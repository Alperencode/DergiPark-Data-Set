Makale Başlığı: The Life of a Hanzade in Crimea: Şahbaz Giray, the Son of Hacı Selim Giray
Özet: After the defeat in 1683 during the Vienna siege  II, the Ottoman Empire started to fight on four fronts with the holy alliance. These wars continued until the 1699 Karlowitz Treaty. The Crimean Khanate, on the other hand, had to struggle with Austria, Poland and Russia, the other three states of the holy alliance, apart from the war with Venice. The Khan of the period, Hacı Selim Giray, is one of the leading figures of these wars. Hanzades such as his sons Devlet Giray and Kaplan Giray were at the forefront with him. Another son of Selim Giray is Şahbaz Giray, who is the subject of our study. The difference of Şahbaz Giray from other hanzades is that he participated in the second and third expeditions of Sultan Mustafa II as the commander of the Crimean soldiers. In these expeditions, he impressed with his courage and bravery, and was complimented by Mustafa II himself. Another difference of Şahbaz Giray is that his dereliction is in the sharia registry number 34. Thus, it has become possible to reveal the daily life of a khan from the Crimean khan dynasty. The problem of this study focuses on exactly this point. In addition to the wars of Şahbaz Giray reflected in the sources, our main sources to examine the other aspects of his life are the chronicles of the period, as well as Ottoman archive documents and the Crimean Sharia register.

Makale Başlığı: Determining the changes in the prevalence of consanguineous marriages and resistant Groups in Turkey: Analyses by marriage cohorts from the 2018 Turkish Demographic and Health Survey
Özet: Objectives: Consanguineous marriages are accepted as a public health concern due to its negative effect on infant mortality and genetical diseases. During the last 50 years, the frequency of consanguineous marriages has decreased by 11 percent from 27 percent to 24 percent in Turkey that refers its resisting structure. The study using data from TDHS-2018 has three main objectives: (1) To determine the changes in the prevalence of consanguineous marriages over time, (2) To understand the changes in internal structure of consanguineous marriages over time, (3) To determine the resistant groups by examining their socio-economic determinants.Methods: The study considers many characteristics of women in both descriptive and multivariate analyses together with marriage cohorts from period before 1993 up to 2014-2018.Results: The results show that the rate of consanguineous marriage among women married before 1993 is 40 percent, while it decreases to 16 percent, by declining 60 percent, among women married in 2014-2018 period. The inbreeding coefficient has also decreased from 0.018 to 0.006 in the same period. These findings are closely related with decline in percentage of marriages among first cousins from 85 percent to 46 percent during same period.Conclusion: The results of the logistic regression indicate a higher risk of consanguineous marriage among women who are uneducated, not working, Kurdish or Arabic, living in the poor households, spent their childhood period in East region/rural and has parents in consanguineous marriages. Consequently, such women can be defined as resistant groups that contribute higher level of consanguineous marriage in Turkey.

Makale Başlığı: THE RISK LEVEL OF BREAST CANCER AND HEALTH BELIEFS OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
Özet: The study was conducted to determine the risk level of breast cancer and health beliefs of health professionals. This descriptive study was completed with 146 health professionals (137 nurses and 9 midwives) working at a university research and practice hospital. The data were collected with Data Collection Form, The Risk Assessment Form for Breast Cancer, and Breast Cancer Health Belief Model Scale (BCHBMS). The data were evaluated with descriptive statistics, independent t-test and one-way ANOVA test. The average age of health professionals participating in the study is 30.06 ± 6.22 and 69.2% of them perform breast self-examination (BSE). It was determined that 97.2% of health professionals have a low risk in terms of breast cancer. It has been found that those who are university graduates and have a good income, have been trained in BSE during their education, and have done BSE, have higher mean scores from BSE's Self-Efficacy sub-dimension of BCHBMS, which will create a statistically significant difference within their group variables (p<0.05). Training of health professionals about BSE during their education is effective in realizing their desired health behaviors. For this reason, it is thought that adding training on early diagnosis of breast cancer to the vocational training curricula of health professionals will contribute to the development of their positive health beliefs.

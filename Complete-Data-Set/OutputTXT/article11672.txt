Makale Başlığı: Lumboperitoneal Shunt Preference in Treatment of Patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus
Özet: Objective: To demonstrate the advantages of Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt surgery applied to patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).Methods: Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data of 20 patients who underwent LP shunt surgery for NPH between 01/01/2012 and 07/04/2022 at the Neurosurgery Clinic of Ordu University Training and Research Hospital were analyzed. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data of the patients as well as their medical records were reviewed. Patients who underwent LP shunt with the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus in our clinic were screened retrospectively, and the success rates and complications after the surgical intervention applied to these patients were recorded.Results: Statistically significant improvements were recorded in Modified Ranking Scale Scores and Mini-Mental State Examination Scores at the end of the first year. The incidence of Gait Disturbance did not differ significantly by gender, The incidence of dementia did not differ significantly by gender, The incidence of urinary incontinence showed a significant change according to gender While all of the women diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus had urinary incontinence in the preoperative period, this rate was seen in only 66.7% of the men. Gait disturbance improved in 80%, urinary incontinence in 60%, and cognitive functions in 60% of patients. No neurogenic complication developed in our operated patients. Wound infection occurred at the abdominal incision site in only two patients (10%). Subcutaneous hematoma occurred in the abdominal region in one patient (5%).  Conclusion: LP shunt surgery has a lower complication rate than VP shunt surgery and is a more easily applicable surgical technique. LPS surgery is a safe and minimally invasive treatment method. It has lower complication rates compared to VPS . LPS surgery is an effective surgical technique. It can be used as an alternative to the VPS procedure in the treatment of NPH patients

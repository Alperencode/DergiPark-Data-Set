Makale Başlığı: Different Approaches to The Concept of The State in Anglican Political Thought: Anglican Interpretations of Monistic State, Pluralist State and Social State Concepts
Özet: Anglican political thought has developed a different understanding from other Christian political thoughts by interpreting the political and social events since its inception. As a politically established official church, it evaluated the political conditions in terms of religion and presented it to British politicians. His greatest contribution was to strengthen British policies by interpreting British politics on a religious basis. The Anglican Church, which is the official religion of the British Crown, has taken place in British political thought with the understanding of the state it has adopted and taught throughout history. In the post-reform establishment period, it adopted a holistic state approach in which the Crown defended its importance and necessity for religion. However, the developments after the 17th century left the holistic understanding to a pluralist state definition in which different identities were also observed. After the First and Second World Wars, with the effect of social events, a social state understanding that would guide the state took its place in Anglican political thought. In this study, it is analyzed how the concept of the state, which is shaped by historical events in Anglican political thought, is defined in different periods and how this change is affected.

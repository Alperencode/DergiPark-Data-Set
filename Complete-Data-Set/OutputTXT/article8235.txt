Makale Başlığı: AN ANALYSIS OF SITUATIONAL CRISIS COMMUNICATION THEORY IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 PANDEMICS
Özet: In crisis situations, the messages from political institutions is crucial to build the trust and cooperation with the public. Today's institutions should have recognized the inadequacy of public information in crisis communications in COVID-19 pandemic. In crisis situations such as COVID-19, a well-coordinated and effective crisis communication strategy provide solutions that assist stakeholders in recognizing risks, identifying threats, assess vulnerabilities, and take steps to increase awareness and prevention in the society.  Communicators can guide the public through the interpretation of information, risks, personal involvement and required actions. This study is a qualitative research based on the situational crisis theory. It attempts to understand what individuals think of the crisis response strategies designed by the government and its affiliates for the COVID-19 crisis. In-depth interviews were conducted. Findings show that three situational crisis response strategies (diminish, rebuild, and reinforce) were implemented in Turkey in the second wave. It was also determined that excuse and justifying, compensation, transcendence and bolstering sub-categories were applied as crisis response options. Moreover, in the context of media strategy, findings revealed that they used multiple crisis spokespersons when responding to the crisis.

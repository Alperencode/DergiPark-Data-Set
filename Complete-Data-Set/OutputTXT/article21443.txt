Makale Başlığı: A special cone construction and its connections to structured tensors and their spectra
Özet: In this work we construct a cone comprised of a group of tensors  hypermatrices  satisfying a special condition, and we study its relations to structured tensors such as M-tensors and H-tensors. We also investigate its applications to spectra of certain Z-tensors. We obtain an inequality for the spectral radius of certain tensors when the order m is odd.

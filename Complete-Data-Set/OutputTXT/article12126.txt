Makale Başlığı: Relationship of hematological parameters with liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with chronic Hepatitis B
Özet: Objective: This study aims to evaluate the hematological parameters that can predict the inflammation and degree of fibrosis in the liver in chronic hepatitis B patients.Method: 237 patients who were followed up with the diagnosis of Chronic Hepatitis B in the internal medicine and gastroenterology outpatient clinics of our hospital and underwent liver biopsy were included in the study. Neutrophil/Lymphocyte, Platelet/Lymphocyte, MPV, MPV/Platelet, and MPV/Lymphocyte values were calculated just before liver biopsy. These parameters were compared with viral serological findings, liver fibrosis, and histological activity scores.Results: Among 237 patients, 101 (43%) female and 136 (57%) male, the mean age was 42.56±11.7. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between MPV/Platelet, MPV/Lymphocyte, HBeAg, HBV-DNA values, and HAI (P<0.05). In addition, a statistically significant positive correlation was found between the HBV-DNA level and the degree of Chronicity Index (p<0.05). When the patients were grouped regarding the HAI<6 or ≥6; MPV, MPV/Platelet, MPV/Lymphocyte, HBV-DNA values were statistically higher in the group with HAI≥6 (p<0.05). When the patients were divided into two groups as HBeAg (+) and (-); in the HBeAg (+) group, chronicity index, HAI, and HBV-DNA levels were found to be statistically significantly higher (p<0.05).Conclusion: MPV/Lymphocyte and MPV/Platelet ratios; In CHB infection, it may be an auxiliary parameter that can evaluate histological inflammation in the liver rather than assessing liver fibrosis.

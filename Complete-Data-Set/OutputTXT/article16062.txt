Makale Başlığı: The Meta-Heuristics Approaches in Training Feed-Forward Neural Networks
Özet: Artificial neural network is one of the most widely used artificial intelligence techniques for system identification and modeling. An effective training process is needed to obtain effective results with artificial neural networks. Metaheuristic algorithms have been used successfully in solving many real-world problems. Especially, optimization of the parameters of the network is required in artificial neural network training. Recently, metaheuristic algorithms have been used for this purpose and successful results have been obtained. There are many metaheuristic algorithms in the literature. The performances of meta-heuristic algorithms can differ according to the problem type. In this study, the performances of popular metaheuristic algorithms such as artificial bee colony algorithm, particle swarm optimization, harmony search, bee algorithm, flower pollination algorithm and cuckoo search are evaluated in the training of feed forward neural network. XOR, 2-bit parity and 3-bit parity problems are utilized for applications. The results obtained for all problems are evaluated in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. In general, it has been observed that neural network training based on metaheuristic algorithm is successful for solving related problems. The best results are found by using artificial bee colony algorithm and cuckoo search.

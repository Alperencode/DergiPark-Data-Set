Makale Başlığı: A Study on Teaching through Letter Correspondence
Özet: The first piece of information about the practice of teaching through letter correspondence in the world was the news titled Shorthand Lessons in the Boston newspaper in 1728. In 1833, The University of Sweden taught women the course of Composition through Letter Correspondence. In England, University Correspondence College and some commercial institutions taught by letter in 1843. In Germany in 1856 and in the USA in 1873, The University of Chicago taught through letter correspondence. In the Ottoman Empire, there is an example of teaching by letter correspondence made by the Ebüzziya family between 1902-1907. The literature lessons, which were held as an individual attempt by letter correspondence between the father and the son, lasted for 6 years. The aim of this study is to show with examples what kind of method Ebüzziya Tevfik Bey used in the literature lessons he taught his son. Thus, the letters written by Ebüzziya Tevfik Bey and his son between Konya and Istanbul were used as the main source. At the same time, the results of the hybrid education in which face-to-face education and education through letter correspondence were carried out and the performance of the student were evaluated together.

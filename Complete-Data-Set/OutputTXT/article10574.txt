Makale Başlığı: A Research on Personal Data Protection in Turkish Legal Literature (2000-2020)
Özet: Personal data protection is a legal field that draws attention due to its direct relationship with developments in information technologies. Concordantly, the number of studies on personal data protection in Turkish legal literature is increasing day by day. However, there is no comprehensive research that depicts the course of this literature based on quantitative data. This article, therefore, aims to map the points where the literary interest is concentrated with such data. In this context, a literature review of 471 studies published on the subject between 2000 and 2020 is presented. The studies indexed in the selected databases are listed and classified in terms of genre, date, discipline, and subject. The classification results are analyzed and the prominent issues in personal data protection are determined. We are of the opinion that the outputs of the research will contribute to the creation and accumulation of knowledge in the field by revealing the current situation in the Turkish legal literature. In this regard, a number of developments that might potentially have an impact on future research in the personal data protection field are predicted.

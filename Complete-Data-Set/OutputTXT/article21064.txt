Makale Başlığı: THE ROLE OF TURKOMANS IN THE SELJUK-BYZANTINE RELATIONS IN THE PROCESS LEADING TO THE WAR OF MYRIOKEFALON
Özet: During the reign of Kilij Arslan II, the western ends of Anatolia became the dense settlement area of the Turkomans. These Turkoman communities, who had a nomadic lifestyle, started to use the fertile pastures in the Byzantine land when the existing pastures began to be insufficient for their animals. In addition, they organized plundering raids on the Byzantine settlement in order to obtain products that they could not produce on their own. Turkomans, unwittingly, started to negatively affect Kilij Arslan II’s policies towards Byzantium with these activities, which they put forward with the influence of their lifestyles. Emperor Manuel held Kilij Arslan II responsible for this destruction caused by the Turkomans and organized many expeditions against the Seljuks. This situation played a decisive role in the process that led to the conflict between the Seljuks and Byzantium and the war of Myryokephalon.

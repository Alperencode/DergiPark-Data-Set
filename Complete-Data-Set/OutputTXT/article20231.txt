Makale Başlığı: Processes of Religiosity, Deism and Atheism in Cultural Struggles in the Social Sphere in Turkey
Özet: This study discusses the developments regarding the processes of religiosity, deism, and atheism during the ruling of the Justice and Development Party in Turkey within the framework of the basic concepts of Bourdieu Sociology, and argues that some evaluations and the news in the media about Turkey's becoming religious or deist in this process are, in fact, the struggle strategies of different groups in the social and political field to gain cultural power. This study argues that the cultural policies put forward by conservative and secular groups that they can achieve a unilateralcultural victory both in the political and social arena in Turkey cause polarization in Turkey's domestic politics and a victory cannot be experienced in which one side is victorious at the end of these struggles. This study discusses the cultural struggles experienced after the establishment of the Republic and the developments after the AK Party government and brings together scientific studies, news in the media, and data of research companies on deism, religiosity, and atheism, with document analysis. The process was evaluated by comparing the obtained data with thedescriptive analysis technique.

Makale Başlığı: Literary Text to Theory From Mustafa Miyasoğlu's Perception of Tradition
Özet: Tradition is a universal social experience that has preserved its existence and reputation in social fields. Its cultural dimension and continuous intertwining with the social field enable it to be a widely used concept. Thus, tradition is a notion worth studying, especially in the field of literature. Tradition has an important place in Miyasoğlu’s thought and constitutes the content of his stories and novels. Miyasoğlu divides the concept of tradition into “changing and unchanging.” The changing, dynamic part represents the cultural elements that include the production of social life in history. In contrast, the unchanging, static part represents the Quranic elements that came with revelation. In this case, Miyasoğlu adopts an understanding of traditionalism. He attaches importance to the role of art, especially literature, in maintaining and transferring both concepts. Traditionalism appears in the writer’s works in the form of criticism of modernism, religion, Islamism, and its broad cultural dimension. In this context, the thoughts of Mustafa Miyasoğlu about tradition were examined under three categories: Miyasoğlu against Western-Centered Thought Movements and Modernism, Miyasoğlu against Turkish Modernization after the Republic, and Language and Tradition in Miyasoğlu. While creating these categories, the main motives of traditionalism, according to Miyasoğlu, were considered.

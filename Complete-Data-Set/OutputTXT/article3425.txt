Makale Başlığı: $\mathcal{I}_2$-Uniform Convergence of Double Sequences of Functions In $2$-Normed Spaces
Özet: In this work, we discuss various types of $\mathcal{I}_2$-uniform convergence and equi-continuous for double sequences of functions. Also, we introduce the concepts of $\mathcal{I}_2$-uniform convergence, $\mathcal{I}_2^*$-uniform convergence, $\mathcal{I}_2$-uniformly Cauchy sequences and $\mathcal{I}_2^*$-uniformly Cauchy sequences for double sequences of functions in $2$-normed spaces. Then, we show the relationships between these new concepts.

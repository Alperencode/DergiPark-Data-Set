Makale Başlığı: Bipolar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
Özet: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are commonly used algorithms to solve complex optimization problems such as network design problems, pathfinding problems, social and economic planning. Thanks to the intelligent methods they use, EAs iteratively refine the initial solution to generate new solutions. One of the frequently used EAs is the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO algorithm reaches the optimum value of a given function based on the best results offered by the swarm and the best results of each individual in the swarm. Although PSO is a successful algorithm, due to its structure based only on the best, it may not reach the optimum value by being stuck in the local value in deceptive function types that do not have a certain order. In this paper, by inspiring from a previous study, bipolar behavior was added to PSO and a new algorithm, Bipolar Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), is presented. In the BPSO algorithm, as in PSO, not only the best individuals but also the bad individuals are allowed to participate in the process of the algorithm. Ten test functions were used to compare the performance of the BPSO algorithm with the standard PSO algorithm. According to the test results, BPSO offered more successful results than the standard PSO.

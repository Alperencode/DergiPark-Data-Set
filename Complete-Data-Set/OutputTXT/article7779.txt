Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Some Agricultural Wastes on the Growth and yield of Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kum.
Özet: In the study; seed mycelium “spawn” used as grafting material; It was prepared from the previously obtained culture sample from Pleurotus ostreatus, which grows naturally Diyarbakir region. In the production of "spawn", as grafting material; wheat grains were used. In mushroom cultivation, compost preparation process; wheat straw, cotton straw were used as raw materials, wheat bran, rice bran and cotton seed crust were used as additive materials. In this research, the shortest time (in days) in P. ostreatus; mycelium growing days; 13.60 days; formation of primordium 22.40 days; first harvest 27.40 days was determined. The amount of fresh mushrooms obtained after three harvests from 100 g of moist compost; calculated as total yield”. The lowest total yield amount was 17.68 g, obtained from cotton straw+%15 rice bran compost media, the highest amount was 36.55 g, obtained from compost of wheat straw+%10 cotton ceed crust.	In conclusion, when cultivation of P. ostreatus is done in compost media of wheat straw+%10 cotton ceed crust, it can be said that more yield can be obtained in less time.

Makale Başlığı: Seasonal Length-Weight Relationships and Condition Factors of Mystus tengara (Hamilton, 1822) in Two Habitats
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between length, weight, condition factor (K), and relative condition factor (Kn) of Mystus tengara (Hamilton, 1822), with special emphasis on seasonal variation of growth patterns, productivity, stocks, and conservation in two distinct ecosystems: pond and river. The results demonstrate that the species did not strictly adhere to the predicted cube law and had allometric growth patterns throughout the season.The condition factor (K) ranged from 0.33 to 1.49, the relative condition factor (Kn) varied from 0.44 to 1.77, and the 'b' values ranged from 2.00 to 3.29. The post-monsoon season saw the greatest average values for the regression parameter (b), condition  factor  (K),  and  relative  condition  factor  (Kn).  The  r2  values  represent  a  significant  relation  between  length  and  weight  in  two  habitats  and  throughout  all  seasons.  The  Pearson’s  correlation  indicates some positive and negative significant correlations among season, length, weight, condi-tion factor, and relative condition factor in the study area (P<0.01 and P<0.05).  The Post Hoc test in-dicates no significant habitat-based association between the same characteristics. However, there is a  significant  (P<0.05)  seasonal  link  between  relative  condition  factor,  condition  factor,  weight,  and  length. As a result, these current findings will assist fisheries managers in creating efficient strategies for the long-term management of M. tengara in its habitats.

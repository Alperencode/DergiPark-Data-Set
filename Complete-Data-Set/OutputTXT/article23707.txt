Makale Başlığı: OUTSOURCING INTELLIGENCE AND CONCEPTUAL MODELLING OF PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES-CONTRACTORS
Özet: Transforming perceptions of terrorist attacks identified by public intelligence authorities in the last half century have led commercial entities to burst into prominence for intelligence gathering. It can easily be asserted that some of Private Intelligence Agencies (PIAs) have evolved into a remarkable complement of official intelligence institutions. Operating with purely trading motives and hypothetically no distinction from a standard commercial enterprise, PIAs are organized as an alternative intelligence gathering institutions for political decision makers. Today, PIAs provide also geopolitical consultancy about regional economic and political events at some parts of the world as well as analysing the complex global commercial activities of multinational corporations. However, there is a conceptual uncertainty between the operational limitations and task scope of PIAs that serve in a wide range of activities all around the world.  The primary aim of this study is to emphasize the conceptual differences of PIAs compared to other post-modern military based contracting companies and to model for a better classification of task scope within the framework of their mission among themselves. Consequently, the functionality and ultimate success of this tendency largely depends on the clarification of the tasks, authorities and responsibilities of PIAs and the establishment of legal infrastructure in which they can work in harmony with the official intelligence agencies.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect on Mobbing Perception of the Childhood Trauma: A Examination on  Non-Clinical Sampling
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of employees who have childhood trauma experiences on mobbing perceptions in light of the Victim Precipitation Theory. Self-reported Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used for the collection of the data, which was developed by Berstein et al. (1994) and evaluated by Şar et al. (2012) for 20 years of abuse and neglect experiences and tested for validity and reliability. In addition, the Mobbing Perception Scale was used as a tool for the determination of traumatized employees due to being intensively targeted to mobbing developed by Leymann (1996) and adapted to Turkish by Yavuz (2007). Data from 211 participants who were active in the public or private sector for at least six months and had at least one childhood traumatic experience were included in the study. As a result of multiple regression analysis with SPSS 25 software, there was a positive and significant effect of sexual, physical and emotional abuse types of childhood trauma on the mobbing perception. Since this study will examine the impact of childhood trauma on mobbing perception, the research is important for presenting the reflection of the consequences of child abuse and neglect on working life that is part of the adult life cycle.

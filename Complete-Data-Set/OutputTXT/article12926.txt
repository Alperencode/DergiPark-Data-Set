Özet: Purpose: This study aimed to determine the knowledge level of individuals with type 2 diabetes regarding cardiovascular disease risk factors and the affecting factors. Materials and methods: This single-center, descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with patients (n=207) who were admitted to Pamukkale University Hospitals Health Research and Application Center Endocrine polyclinic for control between September 2021 and December 2021.Findings: The mean age of the individuals with type-2 DM who participated in the study was 60.99±13.74 years, and had been suffering from type-2 DM for a mean of 12.22±9.86 years. The mean scores of the cardiovascular diseases risk factors knowledge level scale was found to be 17.90±3.33 It was determined that 51.2% of the individuals included in the study were female, 31.9% had a history of type-2 DM and 52.2% had a history of heart disease. When their health-promoting behaviors were examined, it was determined that very few of the participants exercised but paid attention to healthy nutrition. It was determined that the cardiovascular risk factors knowledge levels of the patients did not differ statistically in terms of sociodemographic variables (p>0.05). However, it was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between some variables related to heart health-promoting behaviors such as exercise status, amount of fruit/vegetables consumed daily, preferred foods in snacks, monitoring blood sugar/cholesterol level, getting an ECG and having cardiovascular health checked (p<0.05).Conclusion: The cardiovascular disease risk factors knowledge levels of the patients participating in the study were below the mean score of the scale. Although their level of knowledge was not very low, the ratio of the healthy lifestyle behaviors they developed to the general risk factors knowledge level was found to be quite low. Individuals with type-2 DM who have preventive health behaviors and exhibit positive eating habits have higher knowledge levels than others.

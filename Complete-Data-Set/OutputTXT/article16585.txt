Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCE LEARNING OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SKILLS
Özet: This study aims to examine the secondary school science curriculum (2018) achievements in terms of Bloom's taxonomy categories and levels, and engineering and design skills. Content analysis method was used in the research. Document analysis method was used to collect data. In this context, 245 learning outcomes in the secondary school 5-8th grade Science course curriculum were included in the analysis. In the study, the status of the learning outcomes serving engineering and design skills was determined by the "Engineering and Design Skills Rubric" developed by the researchers. The analysis of the data was carried out with the deductive content analysis approach. In the study, it was determined that almost all of the learning outcomes focused on the cognitive domain. However, it has been determined that the majority of the learning outcomes at each grade level consist of low-level behaviors. Another important result of the research is that the number of learning outcomes that serve to gain engineering and design skills among the 5-8th grade level learning outcomes is almost non-existent. The majority of these few learning outcomes are at the level of creation, and their level of serving to gain engineering and design skills is very low.

Makale Başlığı: AN EMPEROR’S ABSURD JOURNEY TO “THE MOON” FOR THE REVOLT TO THE TRUTH: ALBERT CAMUS’ CALIGULA
Özet: Caligula, which was completed and published by Albert Camus in 1944, is the first playwritten by the author individually. Camus fictionalizes his work, which consists of fouracts, inspired by the life story of the third Roman emperor, Gaius Julius Caesar AugustusGermanicus, better known by the pseudonym Caligula. In this sense, in Caligula, whichhas a biographical as well as a historical characteristics, the main protagonist who gavethe work his name, is an extraordinary emperor who reveals his revolt by falling intononsense. Caligula sets a seemingly impossible goal to rebel against the mortal world. Hewants to reach something that is not of this world, the “moon”. Although this desirecan be interpreted as being distant from the truth of life at first glance, on the contrary,it is directly related to the truth. Therefore, Caligula is not a mad man as it is thought.He is a being who has attained the truth of the world he was thrown into, and thereforesuffers and experiences an existential crisis. The tragedy of Caligula, who refused to actaccording to the truth and exhibited a disengagement with his own will and choice, liesin the dilemma that he lives between his firm belief that he can achieve the goal he setfor rebellion and the knowledge that he will never reach it. This is the point at which theemperor falls into the absurd. In this article, prepared on Caligula, it is aimed both to traceexistentialism, which is in the field of literature as well as philosophy, and to examineCamus’ concepts such as absurd and revolt.

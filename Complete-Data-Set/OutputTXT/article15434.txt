Makale Başlığı: Is Prognostic Nutritional Index Mortality Predictor in Patients with Acute Stroke  in the Intensive Care Unit?
Özet: Aim: The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a simple and useful score for predicting the prognosis in various diseases such as cancers, ischemic heart disease, and pulmonary embolism.The aim of our study is to investigate the association between PNI level and mortality rates of patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic AS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed records for 102 patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic AS admitted to the ICU between January 2017, and January, 2018.Results: During the period,83.3% of 102 patients with ischemic AS, 45.1% were male.The patients were divided into two groups according to the cut-off PNI value (47.8). Patients in the low PNI group (PNI≤47.8) were older than high PNI group (PNI>47.8). Atrial fibrillation (p=0.02) and renal diseases (p=0.049) were observed more frequently in the low PNI group. APACHE II and SOFA scores were higher in the low PNI group. The length of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay were longer in the low PNI group (p<0.05). The ICU and hospital mortality rates were higher in the low PNI group (p<0.001). Presence of atrial fibrillation, high APACHE II and SOFA scores, low GCS and diastolic blood pressure, high neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and low PNI were determined as independent risk factors for mortality. Conclusion: This study presented that low PNI level was closely associated with mortality in patients with AS. Thus, PNI may be considered as a new indicator in determining the prognosis in patients with AS.

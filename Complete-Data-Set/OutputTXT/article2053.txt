Makale Başlığı: EMERY KELEN AND ALOIS DERSO ARE THE CARTOONISTS OF THE LAUSANNE CONFERENCE, AND THE CARTOONS OF TURKISH DELEGATES
Özet: After the Ottoman Empire, defeated in the First World War, signed the Armistice of Mudros, the occupations began. The national liberation struggle of the Turkish nation against the occupations officially ended with the Lausanne Peace Treaty signed on July 24, 1923, at an international conference in Lausanne, Switzerland. The process experienced in the Lausanne Conference and the agreement signed afterward has been the subject of many works written by local and international authors. This article discusses another aspect of the Lausanne Conference, which has a special place in Turkish history. The only visual recordings during the conference process, where cameras were prohibited, were the drawings made by painters and cartoonists. Among the cartoonists attending the Lausanne Peace Conference are Emery Kelen and Alois Derso. The article examined the short biographies of these two cartoonists and some of their drawings about the Turkish delegation.

Makale Başlığı: THE DISAPPEARING WATER STRUCTURES ON THE YEŞILIRMAK RIVER OF AMASYA IN NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES
Özet: Yeşilırmak, passing through the center of the city of Amasya, served as a source to irrigate the fertile lands on its shore and meet the water needs of the settlements. The water structures built to lift and carry water, apparently seen until the mid-20th century, on the river or its banks. While the technologically advanced devices replaced them over time, vineyards and gardens were altered by various urban function areas, especially residences, and floods caused loss of life and property, so it was decided to remove them. The water mills, the water wheels, and the dams were the water structures that were examined. This study investigates the development of the city's natural and built environment and presents the locals' socio-cultural relations during the 19th to the mid-20th century. The documents were obtained from travellers' notes, local historians' manuscripts, and government archives. The primary sources of the study are the documents obtained from the Ottoman and the Republic Archive of the Directorate of State Archives, the works containing the translated records of local historians about the city published by Amasya Municipality, travelogues, photo archives of İBB Atatürk Library and Fonds Albert Gabriel INHA, Médiathèque du Patrimoine et de la Photographie.

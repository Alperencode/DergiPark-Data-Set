Makale Başlığı: Pediatric Angiography: A single center experience
Özet: Objective: Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital anomaly. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are important in congenital heart disease. The aim of this study to share our experience and follow-up results of diagnostic and interventional angiography procedures performed in our center.Materials and Methods: The retrospective study included patients who underwent catheter angiography in our clinic between July 2018 and October 2021. Results: This study included 47 children with a mean age of 5.7 (SD, 2.9) years (0-17 years) who underwent catheter angiography. 47% of study population was girls. Diagnostic catheter angiography was performed in 29 patients. Successful interventional catheter angiography was performed in 18 patients. No significant complications were observed during or after diagnostic and interventional catheter angiography.Conclusion: Diagnostic and interventional angiography procedures can be performed successfully in our clinic. In recent years, interventional angiography procedure has been preferred more because it shortens the hospital stay and does not create surgical scar tissue.

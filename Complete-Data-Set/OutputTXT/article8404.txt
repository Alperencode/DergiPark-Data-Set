Makale Başlığı: Improvisation in Classical Turkish Music
Özet: Improvisation emerges as one of the most important elements of visual and auditory arts. We encounter the improvisation form in almost all cultures. The improvisation form existed in European music until the 19th century, but it still maintains its importance in non-Europian music. The transition to European notation, education and theorizing on music was adopted in Ottoman Turkish music, the meşk system is still the only way of learning Turkish music. Turn of the 20th century, the term gazel, meaning vocal  improvisation, began to be used in Turkish music. In this  article, we analyze the use of makam and lyrics in gazels performed by Tanburi Cemil Bey, Hâfız Sâmi, Hâfız Kemâl and Münir Nûrettin Selçuk in the uşşak makam, one of the foundational, yet most difficult makams of Turkish music. We will also discuss about the importance of the meşk system in learning and keeping the tradition alive in music education.

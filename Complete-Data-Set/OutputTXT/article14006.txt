Makale Başlığı: The Infestation of an Uncanny Ghost: Weasel (Benli, 2020)
Özet: Presence and absence are the situations that the individual determines through the other. The individual, who makes sense of and positions her/his existence through the other, begins to face reality when she/he realizes her/his own limits and potential. Facing the reality and looking beyond the reality takes place with the haunting of the ghosts that the individual carries within herself/himself. These ghosts, always there but revealing their existence only when seen, haunting with the same demand until seen, have a disturbing being with their timeless and uncanny presence. Jacques Derrida explains this power that tries to come out from the inside in the individual's confrontation with herself/himself, these moments of confrontation where suppressed presences try to show themselves, with haunting. When the state of being uncanny, which can be defined by Sigmund Freud's concept of unheimlich, is combined with Derrida's interpretations of haunting, traces and ghosts, the individual's state of defining her/his own existence through the other becomes different. In this definition, the other ceases to be an absolute necessity; the other becomes only an intermediary. In the study, the movie Weasel (Gelincik, Orçun Benli, 2020) is examined through the theories of haunting, the uncanny and ghost. The limits of being haunted, ghostly and uncanny were discussed, and the methods in which the uncanny atmosphere was achieved in the narrative were found out.

Makale Başlığı: THE VARIATION OF THE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE-INFLAMMATION INDEX IN THE PATIENTS WITH VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Özet: In this study, the variability of the systemic immune inflammation index (SII), which is accepted as a new marker of inflammation, was researched in patients with vitamin D deficiency. The biochemistry and hemogram results of outpatients were scanned and recorded retrospectively from digital data. SII was calculated with whole blood parameters (neutrophil x platelet/lymphocyte) for each patient. The relationship between SII and vitamin D variation was investigated. The mean age of 113 patients included in the study was 38.58±12.37 years. Mean levels of vitamin D, B12, and folate were 13.68±6.57 ng/ml, 309.54±110.73 pg/ml and 7.13±2.77 ng/ml, respectively. The mean SII was 434.39±156.72. While vitamin D was below 10 ng/mL in 38 patients (33.6%), it was between 10-20 ng/mL in 56 patients (49.5%) and 20 ng/mL and above in 19 patients (16.8%). Vitamin B12 was lower in the primary group than in the second group (p<0.05). No significant correlation was found between SII and vitamin D values (p>0.05). Vitamin D deficiency is one of the most common health problems, and possible relationships between vitamin D deficiency and inflammation are still under investigation. In this study, we researched the SII variation in patients with vitamin D deficiency, but no relationship was observed.

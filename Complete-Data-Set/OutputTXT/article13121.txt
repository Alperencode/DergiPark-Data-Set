Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Bureaucratic Practices in Education on Teachers' Job Satisfaction
Özet: Bureaucracy is a form of management that affects institutions positively or negatively and still maintains its validity. Job satisfaction is the state of satisfaction that occurs in employees when they fulfill the requirements of their job. One of the factors affecting this satisfaction of the employees is the management approach of the organization they work for. From this point of view, it was desired to examine the effect of bureaucratic practices in schools on teachers' job satisfaction and this study was carried out. Relational screening model was used in the research. The study group of the research consists of 119 teachers working in the city center of Bolu in the 2020-2021 academic year. The "Bureaucratic Characteristics Scale of Schools" developed by Öztürk (2001) and the "Job Satisfaction Scale" developed by Kavutçu (2016) were used as data collection tools in the research. In the analysis of the data, percentage, frequency, ANOVA, T-Test, correlation analysis, Scheffe test and Regression analysis were used by using SPSS 13.0 program. The research data showed that teachers' general perception of bureaucratic practices in education and their job satisfaction were at a "sufficient" level. Considering the results of the research, a positive relationship was found between bureaucratic practices in schools and teachers' job satisfaction. As a result of the findings obtained, various suggestions were made on the subject.

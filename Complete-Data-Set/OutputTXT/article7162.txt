Makale Başlığı: Syntactic-Pragmatic Approaches to Mood and Modality in Turkish
Özet: The traditional prescriptive theories generalize the two different categories mood and modality in one morphological term, which indicates the ignorance of the similarities between mood and then sentential function categories and leads the discussion to specifying both moods and modalities in verbal inflectional suffixes.Morphology ignores the pragmatic and syntactic aspects, which obviously indicates both the deficiency and the impracticality when discussing mood and modality in their realization on the surface of sentences. Because mood is a more abstract category with modality being a more concrete one. Concerning the pragmatic aspects of mood and modality, it is insufficient to define the meanings of the modal suffixes without the contextual and extra-linguistic consideration. And it is pragmatically unacceptable to clarify the meanings of the suffixes like {-mIş} and {-sAydI} according to their modal values.Our consideration in this study focuses on the underlying applied properties rather than the simple formal realizations of mood and modality. When both mood and modality are realized on the sentential linearity, the syntactic and pragmatic aspects of mood are concerned primarily, and for modality, the formal modal markers and the phrasal dominance features are regarded. Therefore, the ‘‘top-down’’ approach is preferred in this study to underline moods compared to the sentential function categories, and the phrasal features of modalities corresponding to the modal markers.

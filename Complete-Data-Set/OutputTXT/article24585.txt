Dermatological examination and dermoscopy revealed widespread telangiectasia located in her left shoulder region. She was diagnosed as UNT developed during pregnancy.Conclusion: UNT is an uncommon vascular skin lesion that has two forms: congenital and acquired. Whereas congenital forms are mostly seen in men, acquired forms are mostly seen in female. Even so etiopathogenesis is still not clear, UNT may relate to grade of estrogen and  progesterone  in body. At second trimester of pregnancy, our patient developed UNT lesions in her left upper arm, shoulder, and chest as a result of increased estrogen levels.

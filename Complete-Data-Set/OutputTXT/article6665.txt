Makale Başlığı: LIVING IN THE MARGINS: DISABILITY AND THE PANDEMIC
Özet: Persons with disabilities often live in the margins, being excluded by the system as well by the impairments they experience. A pandemic such as COVID-19, further pushes them into invisibility, unless active attempts are made to consider them as entitled to the same care as others. This paper explores the manner in which pandemic pushes people with disabilities further into the margins, thus experiencing exclusion. The changes that the pandemic has brought in comes with a price that all people have to pay, However the social and economic costs that people with disabilities experience are uniquely different. The article focuses on economic and social marginalisation that ensues the pandemic and the state response and the struggles that PWD had to experience. Further this is compounded by social exclusion and ‘othering’ that not only complicates their life, but also worsens stigmatising practices. The paper discusses the interplay of the macro context, the market and life within the home that has altered during the pandemic.

Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE 3D T1 SEGMENTATIONS OF CEREBELLUM IN VESTIBULAR NEURITIS PATIENTS
Özet: Aim: Vestibular neuritis is one of the most common causes of acute spontaneous vertigo. In our study, we aimed to analyze the cerebellum volume and cerebellum connections in patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis using the VolBrain program. Materials and Methods: 10 patients and 9 healthy (control) persons were included in the study. Automatic segmentation and volumetric analysis of cerebellum and cerebellum lobules were investigated using magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 19 people. Results: The volumes of 10 cerebellar regions were measured and compared between the patient and control groups. The total volume of the cerebellum was calculated as 123.82 ± 2.57 cm3 in the control group and 119.97 ± 4.15 cm3 in the patient group. In addition, the average amount of gray matter in the cerebellum was 90.63 ± 6.59 cm3 in the control group and 87.87 ± 16.12 cm3 in the patient group. We found volumetric changes to be statistically significant. Conclusion: By performing cerebellum segmentation with 3D T1 sequence of MRI images taken from patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, volume measurement and more detailed examinations can be performed easily with the help of the volBrain program. Moreover, its low cost and its usefulness in diagnosis suggest that this method will be beneficial.

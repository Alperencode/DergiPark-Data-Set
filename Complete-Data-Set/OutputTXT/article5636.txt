Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Storage Conditions on The Migration of Chemicals from Polyethylene Terephthalate and Polycarbonate Bottles to Water
Özet: Objective: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC) bottles have been used widely in the last years for the consumption of  water  and  the  increased  use  of  these  chemicals  has  raised  many  concerns  regarding  their  adverse  effects  on  health.  Phthalates  and  bisphenol A (BPA) are the main endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can migrate from these plastics into potable water.Materials and Methods: The concentrations of phthalate and BPA were measured in water samples that were stored in PET and PC bottles at  different  storage  conditions.  The  method  of  ELISA  was  used  for  the  determination  of  phthalate  and  BPA  levels.  A  standard  curve  is  obtained from the standards prepared at known concentrations of phthalate, BPA, according to their absorbance at 450 nm. The BPA levels of the samples were obtained through the calculation of the absorbance values acquired using the standard curve.Results:  Different  storage  and  heating  processes  applied  on  the  samples  significantly  increased  the  levels  of  BPA  and  phthalate.  One  year of storage led to a statistically significant increase in phthalate levels when compared to the control group. Both BPA and phthalate levels detected in the water samples were higher than the control group depending on the storage conditions including exposure to high temperatures, sunlight and outdoor conditions. Conclusion:  Our  results  indicate  the  necessity  to  establish  the  environmental  conditions  that  must  be  ensured  during  the  production,  transportation and storage processes of the bottles, on a legal basis with legal regulations.

Makale Başlığı: HIZIR MOTIF IN UYGHUR FOLK TALES
Özet: Known as an important part of Turkish culture for centuries, the Uyghurs are known to have made significant contributions to the field of folklore. The rich narrative culture of the Uyghurs is a part of the Turkish culture that emerged with the accumulation of years. The tales that have reached the present day by being transferred from generation to generation and enriched in the oral tradition since history are narratives that have both local and universal elements. The rich culture of the society is told to us through motifs, the smallest element in fairy tales. One of the main motifs we encounter in fairy tales is the motif of Hızır.Hızır is the most common character in Turkish tribes and frequently encountered in folk l literature. Among the Uyghurs, as in other Turkish tribes, there are many beliefs about Hızır, and it is known that some of these beliefs and understandings date back to the narratives before Islam.The aim of this study is to deal with the Hızır motif in Uyghur tales with examples; The aim is to examine the effects and traces of our ancestors' ancient culture on the motifs of Hızır. It is hoped that this publication will contribute to comparative studies on the motif of Hızır, which is one of the common values of Turkish tribes.

Makale Başlığı: Aesthetic Characteristics in the Qurʾān
Özet: It can be argued that the notion of aesthetics occupies a central place in Islam’s revealed text. Discussing the qualities that characterize the notion of aesthetics has attracted the attention of scholarly tradition. In the Qurʾānic discourse, various qualities can be discerned to characterize aesthetics.To gain a better understanding and to construct a comprehensive image of the Qurʾānic perspective of aesthetic characteristics, the Qurʾān must be taken in its entirety. However, this study is based on the thematic exegesis genre, which aims to present a holistic view of the theme as discussed throughout the entire Qurʾānic text considering selected modern Qurʾānic exegeses, where more attention is given to a number of exegetical aspects considered in thematic exegesis.

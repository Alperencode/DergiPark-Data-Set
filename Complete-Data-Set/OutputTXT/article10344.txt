Makale Başlığı: Periodically Party Systems in Turkish Political Life
Özet: The structures of political parties can show heterogeneity according to the conditions in which they were born and the social structure of the country in which they are located. When evaluated in terms of action, program and method, although they perform similar functions, there are differences between them. It can be said that the founders, representatives, voters, organizational structures and ideologies constitute this differentiation. Therefore, political parties coexist in different forms and conditions in every society. Depending on social, economic, political and cultural factors, the number of parties, their influence, importance, relations between each other and power strategies differ from one society to another.In this context, party systems specific to their own structures can be mentioned in each political regime. The party system, which can change depending on the political, social, economic and cultural conditions in a society, is explained as a whole that shapes the functioning of political systems and explains the complex and mutual relations network between political parties and within themselves.In this study, considering the party systems that have emerged in the political life of the Republic of Turkey from the foundation of the state to the present, it has been separated periodically and the formation, causes and effects of the party systems in these periods have been examined in terms of political, social and cultural aspects.

Makale Başlığı: Verses Used in Fıqh Books Other Than Jurısdıctıons  -At the Example of Book al Fiqh 'ala al madhāhib al arba'ah of ‘Abd al-Rahmān al-Jazīrī-
Özet: The Qur’ān, which is the source of all Islamic sciences, is also the first reference source for fiqh books because of the verses it contains. In this respect, the science of fiqh and the science of tafsir are in a close relationship. The criteria of the science of tafsir should also be taken into account while making judgments from the verses. Although the interpretations of the law come to mind first when the verses of ahkām are mentioned, in this study, we aimed to determine how the fiqh books benefited from the verses other than the derivation of judgments. we have determined as a field of study because it is comprehensive, contains the views of four sects and is also known in our country we have examined ‘Abd al-Rahmān al-Jazīrī’s al-Fiqh ala'l-medhāhibi’l-arba‘a book. We group the verses used outside of being evidence for the provisions as follows: We have separated: Verses used in terms of language, Verses that are mentioned as examples on various subjects, Verses about the wisdom and benefits of fiqh provisions, and lastly verses which talk about major sins. The fact that the verses are used as examples from different aspects in fiqh books, apart from the determination of judgment, is an indication that the Qur’ān also has a source value other than legal provisions.

Makale Başlığı: ACCEPTABİLİTY OF COVID-19 VACCİNE AND FACTORS AFFECTİNG VACCİNE HESİTATİON İN PREGNANT HEALTH CARE WORKERS
Özet: Aim: To determine the acceptability of the corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the main reasons for vaccine hesitation in pregnant health care workers (HCWs). Method: 135 pregnant HCWs were questioned face-to-face about perception and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for rejection of the vaccine. Participants were evaluated according to:(1) whether they wanted to be vaccinated, (2) whether they were actively working in COVID-19 units, and (3) whether they were a doctor or other healthcare professional. Results: Sixty-six (48.9%) participants stated that they want to be vaccinated if the COVID-19 vaccine is recommended to pregnant women.We observed that active staff in COVID-19 units and doctors had more intention to be vaccinated.The thought that the COVID-19 vaccine would be harmful to the baby was significantly higher in other HCWs group than doctors. Conclusion: The present study revealed that even if the rate of vaccine acceptance among pregnant HCWs was higher than pregnant non-HCWs, it remained below the rate required for “herd immunity” for COVID-19 disease.  Lack of data on the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women is the most important obstacle. We can overcome obstacles only by including pregnant women in phase 3 studies of COVID-19 vaccines.

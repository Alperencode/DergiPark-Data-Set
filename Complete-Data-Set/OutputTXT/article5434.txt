Makale Başlığı: Etnomüzikoloji ve Müzik Eğitimi: Diyaloğu Geliştirmek
Özet: This review article investigates the potential in selected recent South African publications for developing the interface between ethnomusicology and music education, in a relationship that encourages a critical edge. It engages the challenge posed by such texts for reconciling accessibility in the classroom with theoretical rigour in ethnomusicological research, and suggests that the point of accessibility and relevance in ethnomusicology is in informing teaching (methodologically) and developing materials (conceptually and theoretically). The article explores the extent to which the texts constitute a dialogue between ethnomusicological and educational enterprises, and articulate – implicitly or explicitly – with the present Arts and Culture curriculum. It argues that music educators and researchers should engage more deeply with the complexity of Arts and Culture in the context of educational transformation in South Africa, and concludes that not all the texts engage equally or consistently with such complexity.

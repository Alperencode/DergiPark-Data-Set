Makale Başlığı: Phenomenon Of Internal Migration On Movement Of Turkish Cinema Factory in 1970’s
Özet: The concept of migration can be defined, in its most basic form is as moving from one place to another. Since there are many types of this movement, which has been effective in the entire human history, the subject has been limited to the internal migration movement in turkey in order to reduce the research to a more spesific one. Altrough there are different factors affecting internal migration, the movement has created many social problems in both migratory and migratory places. In the context of these explanations, the main objective is to analyze the causes and consequences of the internal migration movement as a sociological phenomenon, especially the social mood of the period. While making this analysis, scientific explanations will be used and we wanted to determine the maniseftations of the phenomenon of internal migration on the screen by appearing in Turkish movies that show the social structure of the period that we think is directly related to the subject in order to approach the subject from a completely different perspective. In the context of these explanations, a sociological analysis will be tried to be put forward.

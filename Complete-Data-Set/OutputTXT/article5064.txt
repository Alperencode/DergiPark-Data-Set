Makale Başlığı: THE ROLE OF CULTURAL CAPITAL ON CAREER SUCCESS
Özet: This research paper examines the role of cultural capital on career success. Career success were mostly discussed in the literature on the axis of demographic, human capital, social capital and structural factors, but the effect of cultural capital, which the individual started to acquire from early childhood, received limited attention. Although it has been argued that cultural capital plays role during the recruitment phases of professional service careers, it is unclear that whether it plays a role in career success. Quantitative data collection method was preferred in this study. 126 public relations professionals working in companies affiliated to the Communication Consultancy Companies Association (IDA) and with the convenience sampling technique 199 experts working in other sectors were reached. The results have indicated that, there is a positive and significant relationship between the cultural capital of the employees and their career success (objective and subjective). However, even though the cultural capital levels of public relations experts are higher than those of other employees, it has been found that the effect of these cultural resources on career success is much more limited than that of other employees.

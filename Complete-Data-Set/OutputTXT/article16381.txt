Makale Başlığı: Syntaxonomy of the Sandy Steppes’ Vegetation in Central Anatolia, Türkiye, and its Surroundings
Özet: The syntaxonomical analysis of the sandy steppes’ vegetation, which is completely in volcanic areas in Central Anatolia and its surroundings, was conducted in this study. Within the scope of the study, 23 relevés recorded from the sandy steppes’ vegetation around Karapınar in Konya Province and İscehisar in Afyonkarahisar Province were evaluated together with the study conducted around Göreme in Nevşehir Province in 2018 and 2019. The Braun-Blanquet floristic method was used for syntaxonomic analyses. As a result of the evaluation, two completely new alliances (Centaureo pulchellae-Artemision campestris and Poo bulbosae-Artemision campestris), two associations (Minuartio arachnoideae-Stipetum hohenackerianae and Poo bulbosae-Artemisetum campestris) and one sub-association was defined. The syntaxa defined were attributed to the Festucetalia vaginatae order, representing the loamy sandy steppe communities developing in European forest-steppes and steppe regions, and the Koelerio glaucae-Corynephoretea canescentis class. This study revealed that the distribution of the Festucetalia vaginatae order has been extended to Central Anatolia, Türkiye, and its surroundings.

Makale Başlığı: Half-Lightlike Submanifolds of Metallic semi-Riemannian Manifolds
Özet: The aim of the present paper is to study half-lightlike submanifolds of a semi-Riemannianmanifold endowed with a metallic structure. We introduce a special half-lightlike submanifoldcalled screen semi-invariant half lightlike submanifold in metallic semi-Riemannian manifoldsand give an example. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the distributionsincluded in the definition of such half lightlike submanifolds to be integrable. Moreover, weanalyze geometry of a screen semi-invariant half lightlike submanifold in a locally metallic semi-Riemannian manifold when it is totally geodesic and screen conformal.

Özet: The innovation movements that started to be seen in the Ottoman State since the 18th century were developed with the radical reforms carried out during the reigns of Sultan Selim III (1789-1807) and Sultan Mahmud II (1808-1839). These innovation movements reached an important level in the axis of modernization with the declaration of the Tanzimat Edict dated November 3, 1839, which was declared during the reign of Sultan Abdülmecid (1839-1861). While primary education was made compulsory during the reign of Sultan 2nd Mahmud, Rushdiye Schools were opened to train civil servants for state levels and to fill the gap between primary (sıbyân) and military schools. The first boys' Rushdiye School was opened in Istanbul in 1847, and then Rushdiye schools were tried to be opened in the provincials. After a while, the number of Rushdiye schools increased with the opening of the girls' Rushdiyes and the inclusion of Christian children in the Rushdiye schools. Finally, rushdiyes, continued their official status until 1913, were opened in almost every corner of the empire and played an important role in the spread of modern education.In this study, a statistics of the years 1889-1890 are emphasized.

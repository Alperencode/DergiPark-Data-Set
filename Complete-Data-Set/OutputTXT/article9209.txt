Makale Başlığı: Relationship of isometric strength and anaerobic power with sports injuries in Greco-Roman wrestlers
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of sports injuries and functional level with anaerobic power and isometric strength in Greco-Roman style wrestlers and compare the injured and uninjured athletes in terms of this parameters.Methods: This study was conducted on Greco-Roman style wrestlers aged between 11-16 years. Jamar hand dynamometer was used to evaluate upper extremity isometric strength, The Wall Squat Test was used to evaluate lower extremity isometric strength, Medicine Ball Throw Test was used to evaluate upper extremity anaerobic power and the Modified Three Box Jump Test was used to evaluate lower extremity anaerobic power. The Identification of Functional Ankle Instability and the Kerlan-Jobe Shoulder Elbow Score were used to determine functional level profile. Results: The right- and left-hand grip strength (p=0,003), (p=0,009) and the Medicine Ball Throw Test scores of shoulder or elbow injured athletes was higher than non-injured athletes (p<0.001). There was no difference in ankle injured and non-injured athletes for Wall Squat (p=0,414, p=0,724), and Modified 3 Box Jumping Test scores (p=0,404).Conclusion: Injured wrestlers’ upper extremity isometric strength and anaerobic power is higher than uninjured wrestlers. There is no difference in lower extremity isometric strength and anaerobic power. In wrestlers, particularly upper extremity sport injury has not negative effect on power and strength parameters.

Makale Başlığı: Liquefaction Analysis of the Haydarpaşa Port Project Area Considering Nonlinear Seismic Local Acceleration Variations
Özet: The need to carry out liquefaction analyses in detail and quickly reach realistic solutions for these analyses has led to the widespread use of computer technologies in this context. In this study, the liquefaction potential for Haydarpaşa Port (Istanbul) project area was investigated by using real acceleration-time variations depending on earthquake scenarios through computer programs. Seismic response analyses were carried out by the Deepsoil software. The earthquake records of Mw=5.5, Mw=6.0, Mw=6.6, Mw=7.1 and Mw=7.6 magnitudes (Bolu-Düzce-1, Çankırı-Orta, İzmir-Seferihisar, Bolu-Düzce-2, and İzmit-Gölcük, respectively) were used in the analyses, and peak ground acceleration (PGA) values were obtained for each earthquake by choosing the non-linear method. The simplified theoretical method and Novoliq software were used in liquefaction analysis. Analyses were carried out realistically by considering the earthquake records. Liquefaction analyses were conducted according to 9 different methods for each earthquake magnitude in the Novoliq software. Liquefaction analyses were completed according to a total of 10 different methods with the simplified theoretical method, and the results were compared with each other. It has been concluded that there is a risk of liquefaction at all depths for earthquakes of specified magnitudes in the investigated field.

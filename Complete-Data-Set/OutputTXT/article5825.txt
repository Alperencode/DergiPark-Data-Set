Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF SPINOZA'S GEOMETRICAL METHOD IN THE CONTEXT OF DESCARTES' MATHESIS UNIVERSALIS PROJECT AND UNDERSTANDING OF METHOD
Özet: In this study, my aim is to investigate the effect of Descartes' understanding of science and method on Spinoza's geometrical method. Descartes wanted to establish a universal science (mathesis universalis) based on arithmetic and geometry. His ideas about this universal science also shaped his understanding of method. Descartes' idea of mathesis universalis and his understanding of method were also directly effective in shaping Spinoza's understanding of geometrical method. Since I wanted to show how Spinoza's geometrical method was shaped in my work, I examined Descartes' mathesis universalis project and his understanding of method in the First Part. In this context, I discussed his ideas about geometric order. In the Second Part, in order to show the origins of Spinoza's understanding of geometrical method, I discussed Spinoza's works from Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione, which was influenced by Descartes, to the Ethics in terms of geometrical method. My study aims to show that Spinoza's geometrical method did not emerge suddenly and developed through many stages up to the Ethics, his geometrical method was shaped in time.

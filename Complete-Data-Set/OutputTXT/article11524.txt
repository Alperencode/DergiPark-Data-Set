Makale Başlığı: The effect of activity on some milking parameters in holstein cows
Özet: The study was conducted on 41-second lactation Holstein cows of German origin. The shelter type is a semi-open field type and the research period is 12 months. The activities in the first 100 days of lactation per day were 451.4 ± 133.5, and in the second 100 days, it was determined at 420.78 ± 118.0. The activities are divided into 3 parts within 24 hours (at night, during the day between two milkings, and in the evening). While there was no statistical difference between days 100 and 200 of lactation, the lowest activity was recorded at night and the highest activity during the day. The conductance, milk flow, and milking duration of the milk were within the normal range in the first 100 and 200 days and no statistical difference between them could be determined. Mean daily milk yield was 28.28 ± 3.86 kg for the first 100 days and 25.15 ± 3.61 kg for the following 100 days, and the difference was found to be significant (P<0.001). To investigate the influence of the daily activity numbers taken into account as factors on the milking parameters, 4 groups were formed for the 100th and 200th days. Accordingly, the effect of activity on milk conductivity, milking duration, and milk yield could not be determined in the first 100 days; its effect on milk flow rate proved significant (P<0.05). No effect of activity on milking parameters was observed in 200 days of lactation. It is assumed that the inclusion of the housing type, lactation number, and lactation period as well as the seasonal effect in activity studies in cows will contribute positively to animal welfare in herd management.

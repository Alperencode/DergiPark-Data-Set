Makale Başlığı: Demographic structure and characteristics of Balıkesir province according to the 1935 census
Özet: The most effective method for countries to keep themselves under control is a census. Censuses reveal data indicating the socio-economic and cultural structure of a country in all aspects. It is thus possible to analyze the needs of the state and the society that constitutes the state more accurately based on the collected data. In this context, the second census conducted in the Republic of Turkey is the 1935 Census. This census gives us detailed information on the socio-economic and cultural structure of Balıkesir province. The purpose of our study, which we prepared based on this information, is to scrutinize the population of Balıkesir and reveal its potential in light of the statistical data. This paper first addresses the population issue and attempts to shed light on why censuses were needed. Secondly, in the process leading to the 1935 Census, the history of Balıkesir was explained. Subsequently, the preparations in Balıkesir were outlined within the framework of the preparations made across the country for the census. The population data of the Balıkesir province were reviewed based on the results of the 1935 census. In the light of these data, Balıkesir's population structure and density in terms of gender, literacy rate, birthplaces of the population, disability status, and professional preferences were evaluated using the document analysis technique.

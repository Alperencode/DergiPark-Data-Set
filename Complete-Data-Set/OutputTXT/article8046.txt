Makale Başlığı: Review of Implementation Tools Used in Protected Areas: Applicability of Conservation Easement Tool in Turkey
Özet: The "protection" approach within the framework of the concept of sustainability, which is given importance, constitutes the common policy of all countries at the point of elimination of environmental problems and climate change increasing with the effects of globalization. As a matter of fact, it is seen that have been broken new ground in recent years within the framework of the concept of protection in Turkey. However, it is seen that conflicts arise between protection practices and private property due to property restrictions and these conflicts are subject to the jurisdiction. The fact that these conflicts and problems cannot be resolved with current legal regulations and practices necessitates the development of alternative implementation tools. Within the scope of the study, a general evaluation is made about the application tools used in conservation areas in Turkey, and the problem areas of each tool is determined by making a comparative analysis. It is emphasized that traditional implementation tools should be evaluated together with financial and economic implementation tools in the management of protected areas, implementation of conservation policies and plan implementations. Based on this inference, it is evaluated that the "conservation easement" instrument can be integrated into the Turkish Legal System.

In the first execution, explanatory factor analysis and reliability analysis were performed with the data obtained from 414 emergency health services station workers. Confirmatory factor analysis was carried out with the data obtained from the second execution, which was made with a group of 230 emergency health services station workers different from the first group. The scores obtained from the sample application made with four independent scales developed within the scope of the research and the demographic characteristics of the participants were analyzed by comparison tests. SPSS 26.0 and AMOS statistical software were used in the analysis of the data. Data were collected from a total of 644 pre-hospital emergency medical services workers working in 59 different provinces in Turkey.Results: Four independent scales were developed within the questionnaire form created in the first stage of the research. Satisfaction, productivity, performance, and safety sub-dimension’s reliability values were 0.878, respectively; 0.856; was determined as 0.825 and 0.935. It was concluded that the four independent scales developed in the context of the participants in this study were valid and reliable. No significant difference was found between the gender, title, and duration of duty of the emergency health services station workers and their scale scores (p>0.05).Conclusion: The developed scale will contribute to the literature on this subject and to studies on improving 112 emergency aid stations in terms of safety, performance, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Makale Başlığı: The Main Factors of Split Christians from Jewish Community and Religion
Özet: Christianity is a religion which has emerged in Palestine region in the early part of the first century AD within the intellectual, theological and cultural geography of Judaism which has two thousand years of tradition. Even though it has recognised as a heretic sect within Judaism in the years it first appeared, by the passing of time it separated itself from Judaism and maintained its existence as a different religion. The parting of Christianity from Judaism took place in the different times in the political, theological and cultural fields. Even though giving a certain date about this separation is not possible, picturing this process is possible by the examination of main factors and breaking points which provided Christianity to differentiate from Judaism by creating its own theology and liturgy. The most important factors of this separation process are the theology and mission activity of Paul, observance of Jesus as the expected Messiah, the concessions that has been given from the Jewish Law by the increase of Gentile population among Christians and the exclusion of Christians out of Jewish community. In this article, main factors that provided Christianity identify itself as a different religion and causes of the split of the last parts of Christianity within Judaism will be examined within the historical process.

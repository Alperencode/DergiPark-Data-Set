Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Nursing Interventions Performed By Nursing Students and Their Competency Levels in Clinical Practice
Özet: Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the nursing interventions performed by nursing students and their competency levels in clinical practice.Method: This descriptive and comparative study was carried out with 381 nursing students who agreed to participate. The data were collected using the "Personal Information Form" and the "Nursing Interventions Self-Assessment Form". Collected data were evaluated via frequency, percentages, mean tests, and the chi-square test.Results: The results showed that 50.1% of the students had enough theoretical knowledge in clinical practice, and 28.9% were able to perform clinical skills. The rate of fourth-grade students performing 30 of 41 nursing interventions was statistically significantly higher than the second and third-grade students (p<0.05). Among the nursing interventions, 93.7% of the students felt competent in body temperature measurement, 92.4% in assessing respirations and radial pulse, and 92.1% in blood pressure measurement. 50.9%, 49.6%, and 47% felt incompetent in nasogastric tube insertion, nasogastric tube feeding, and performing chest compressions practices, respectively.Conclusion and Suggestions: The study revealed that student nurses felt competent in interventions that they frequently practice like measurement of vital signs, taking patients’ health history and parenteral medication, and incompetent in interventions like urinary catheter insertion and nasogastric tube insertion that they have fewer practice opportunities at hospitals. it is recommended to conduct further studies to determine the practices that nursing students feel incompetent, increase the theoretical education and laboratory practices that improve the competency levels of students, use active learning methods, prepare proficiency exams to pass classes, create portfolios, support the training provided by supervisor nurses in clinics and conduct peer training activities.

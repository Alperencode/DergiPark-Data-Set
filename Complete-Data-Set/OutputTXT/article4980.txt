It has been determined that the most needed issues by families in terms of self-regulation of their children are changing the problem behaviors of children, discipline methods, and family rules in terms of providing discipline. In the study, it was also concluded that most families wanted their children to receive training on self-regulation and needed support in this regard. In this context, it is crucial to support children's self-regulation and to include families and teachers in training.

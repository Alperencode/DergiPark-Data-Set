Makale Başlığı: Endotracheal Intubation in the Emergency Department
Özet: We read with great interest the article titled "Evaluation of mechanical ventilated patients in emergency department", published in the last issue of your journal in 2021 and prepared by Baykan et al. We thank the authors for this interesting article in which the characteristics of patients followed up with mechanical ventilation in the emergency room are discussed. However, we would like to point out a few points about endotracheal intubations and their complications in the emergency department.

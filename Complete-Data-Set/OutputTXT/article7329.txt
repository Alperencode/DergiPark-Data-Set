Makale Başlığı: Reflections on the Integration of Environmental Education by a Primary School Teacher
Özet: The integration of environmental education is embedded with challenges such as inadequate knowledge of what environmental education entails. This situation was not different to what was encountered during the researchers’ training to be a teacher from the schools where they acquired their teaching practice. It was observed that there was minimal or no integration of environmental education in the teaching and learning process. Therefore, this paper reflected on how a primary school teacher integrated environmental education in teaching and learning. The findings from this paper may assist teachers in developing a positive approach to the process of ongoing attempts and the will to integrate environmental education. It may expose the kinds of knowledge other teachers have of what environmental education entails and its integration in school subjects as well as the instructional strategies that they use. The focus on the challenges and the opportunities may excite teachers in that those who have similar circumstances would use the findings from this paper as a launch pad to work on their strengths or weakness in the endeavor to integrate environmental education.

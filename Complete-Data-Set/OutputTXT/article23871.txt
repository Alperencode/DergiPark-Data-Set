Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Factors Affecting the Microbiological Quality of Carboy Drinking Water
Özet: In this study; forty-two water samples were taken from six different environments from each of the two trademarks preferred for drinking water purposes in Sivas city. The samples were taken daily from the moment the carboy drinking water reaches the consumer, after the pump is attached to the carboy drinking water, and until the end of the carboy drinking water. Total coliform bacteria analysis, mesophilic aerobic bacteria and psychrophilic aerobic bacteria analyzes were applied to the water samples. According to analysis results; total coliform bacteria were not detected in any water samples taken from the carboys used for drinking water when they reached the consumer and in the first days of use. However, as the usage time of drinking water bottles increased, total coliform bacteria were detected in the samples. According to the results of this study; it has been revealed that the consumption time, the hygiene of the water pump, the environment and usage conditions of the carboy water for drinking water purposes affect the microbiological quality.

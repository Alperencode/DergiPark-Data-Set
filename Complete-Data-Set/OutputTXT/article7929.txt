Makale Başlığı: Attitude Towards Marketing Surveys: The Comparison of Student and Non-Student Samples
Özet: Using student samples in marketing research is a debated issue. This study aims to test the differences in attitude towards surveys and marketing surveys between student and non-student samples, the variation differences in attitude towards surveys and marketing surveys between student and non-student sample, the differences among sample groups by means of the impact of different types of promised incentive. The sample of the study consists of two convenient sample groups (student and non-student samples). The survey was applied online and face-to-face to randomly selected 94 college students and 90 non-student individuals. The results demonstrate that there is a difference in attitude towards surveys but not for marketing surveys. While results measuring survey value results are mixed, there is no difference in variation of attitude towards marketing surveys for student and non-student samples. Also, no significant differences exist for the incentives related to the attitude towards marketing surveys.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Digital Developments On Company Law
Özet: At the end of the 25-year development and transformation phase, the virtual universe began to develop its own dynamics. In particular, technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain have emerged in the digital world and contain many conveniences compared to traditional business ways in the real world. Innovations such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and smart contracts offer us a very useful set of tools for managing and monitoring companies within the framework of the principles of accountability, transparency, responsibility and fairness. The elimination of information asymmetry, which is a prerequisite for the complete separation of the management and auditing structures, becomes an achievable goal thanks to these new tools.It is not to be expected that the tools used in company organization will stay away from developments in the digital world. It is clear that these innovations will be useful in achieving the goals set under corporate governance principles. On the other hand, it should be remembered that, as with any innovation, there will be side effects and these tools should be used to anticipate these effects.

Makale Başlığı: Oriental Women in 19th Century French Orientalist Paintings: Women in Harem, Hammam and Public Spaces
Özet: The images of Oriental women are among the most alluring themes of European orientalism. Oriental women are seen as objects of desire, femmes fatales from whom all men need to avoid, or oppressed women who must be saved from the barbary of the “Orient” and Oriental men. Deterioration of the political and military power of the Ottoman Empire, which was a crossroad between the Mediterranean East and the European West, also influenced the representations of Oriental women. Cultural, social, political, and intellectual developments, which impact the changes, transformations, and continuities of orientalism, also emerge as a significant factor that shapes gender relations both in the “Orient” and “Occident”. In such a context, understanding the representations of oriental women in paintings necessitates a multi-dimensional perspective which includes being aware of the fact that neither a homogeneous “Orient” nor a homogeneous “Occident” exits; understanding gender relations as power relations; and the dynamics of power relations between the “Orient” and “Occident”. In such a context, considering the social, political, and historical conditions of the 19th-century, we will focus on the representations of Oriental women figured in different places in 19th-century French orientalist paintings and question the forms of othering of women who were defined as Orientals by orientalists. To better understand the representations of race and class that impact gender representations, this subject will be considered within the framework of the theory of intersectionality and postcolonial feminism.

Makale Başlığı: The Daily Life Experiences of Conservative Upper-Middle-Class Women in Turkey
Özet: Conservatism is currently a significant political ideology that determines the political sphere in Turkey. As known, conservative ideology is represented in the center-right parties in the country. However, the conservative Islamic ideology, which became visible as a political actor in the 1970s, was brought to power first at the local level and then at the national scale in the 1990s. Today, it can be argued that this is why Islamist conservatism leads central politics. This political alteration has also been reflected in the culture and daily life of society. After all, Islamist conservatism becomes visible in daily life with transformations that we can refer to as modern popular and consumer culture. Principally conservative women play a notable role in building this synthesis in everyday life. With these concerns, the article tries to find out how the contents of these specific experiences take place, particularly through interviews with upper-middle-class women, with particular deep interviews that were conducted in a neighborhood the upper-middle-classes lived in Istanbul. Then the data obtained from these interviews were divided into themes and analyzed the connections formed by upper-middle-class women with new forms of life in Turkey, and their contents are tried to be learned.

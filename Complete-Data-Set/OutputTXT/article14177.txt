Besides its economic cost, unemployment can also increase the severity of the outcomes because it results in social and psychological consequences.

Our study aims to evaluate these costs, the relationship among unemployment, income, crime, and population growth from 1990 to 2019 was analyzed. The results of cointegration tests show that there is a long-term relationship a mong unemployment, income, population growth, and crime in Turkey. According to the results obtained from the causality test, there is a one-way causality relationship between the crime rate and unemployment variables. There is a two-way causality relationship between crime rate and population growth. It has been determined that there is a one-way causality relationship between the income and unemployment variables and the population growth variable. Because unemployment is a chronic problem in Turkey, it is clear that its effects create more serious conditions in the economy. Taking this reality into consideration while deciding on the economic policies and fighting unemployment could have a supportive effect over economic and social development.

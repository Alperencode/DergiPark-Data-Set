Makale Başlığı: Incendies in the Context of Dialectics of Cinema and Hybrid Narrative
Özet: The subject of this study, which aims to read a motion picture from a multiple perspective, is about dividing and reassembling the film of Incendies (2010) by Denis Villeneuve within the context of its filmic framework. For this purpose, a dialectical explanation of the main lines and intellectual features of the First, Second and Third Cinema concepts, which are essentially mutually exclusive but form the basis of each other when evaluated in the axis of emergence, is made through the film in question. Based on this starting point, it is aimed to present a holistic and multiple view by associating the features of the film with the narrative features of the First, Second and Third Cinema. In the study designed in a qualitative pattern to understand which narrative pattern the film is included in, it was concluded that the film “Incendies” has a hybrid narrative that erodes the boundaries of different conventions. As a production that makes a sharp reference to the conservatism of three narrative patterns, each of which declares its independence in cinema, Incendies presents the harmony of togetherness with the dialectic of narrative patterns between themselves.

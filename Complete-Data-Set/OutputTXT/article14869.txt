Makale Başlığı: Obtaining Polyamide 6.6 Based Nano Fibers on the Different Non-Woven Surfaces via Solution Blow Spinning Technique and Investigation of Their Suitability for Vehicle Cabin Filters
Özet: In the scope of the study, it was aimed to develop alternative filter surfaces to 100 g/m2 spunbond filter surfaces, which are used extensively in cabin filters. With this aim, as an alternative to commercially used filter surface, the different nonwoven surfaces, which obtained with different weights and different nonwoven surface techniques (Spunbond, meltblown, airlaid) and different polymers (Polypropylene, Polyester), were used and performance tests were performed, and their comparison and usage possibilities were examined. In addition, using a new nanofiber production method, “solution blow spinning technique”, composite filter surfaces were obtained by transferring polyamide 6.6 (PA 6.6) nanofibers onto both commercial and alternative surfaces. The obtained new surfaces were compared with commercial and different nonwoven filter surfaces in performance tests. When the results obtained are examined, the air permeability values ranged from 603 to 4271 lt/m²sn and pore diameters ranged from 7 to 231 μm of different nonwoven surfaces obtained with different weights and different nonwoven surface techniques showed variability. At the same time, it was seen that the meltblown surfaces had the least pore diameter with the 7μm. On examining the air permeability and pore diameters of polyamide transferred surfaces, it was determined that the air permeability values decreased up to 114 lt / m²sn and the pore diameters decreased to 5μm after the alternative surfaces were coated with nanofibers. According to these results, it is concluded that different surfaces can be used as alternative to commercial filter surfaces, as well as the developed layered filter surfaces can be used for effective filtration.

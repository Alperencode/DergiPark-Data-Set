Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Infill Wall Materials and Their Location in Plan on the Behaviour of a Reinforced Concrete Building
Özet: It is known that infill walls affect the strength and rigidity of the structure, although the effect of infill walls is neglected in the calculation and design of reinforced concrete structures. In this study, the effects of two different infill wall materials, namely vertically perforated brick and gas concrete block, and different wall locations on a ten-storey symmetrical structure with six spans in the x-direction and three spans in the y-direction with a reinforced concrete framed load-carrying system were investigated. According to Turkey Building Earthquake Code-2018, 16 models were examined in the SAP2000 program, which is based on the finite element method. Infill walls with different materials are defined in the program as a single equivalent pressure bar according to their properties. The effects of different infill wall types and different infill wall placements on the horizontal displacement of a reinforced concrete framed structure, relative storey drifts, strength, and the performance target of the building under horizontal and vertical loads were examined on the models made. As a result of the research, it was observed that infill wall material types and infill wall location significantly reduced the horizontal displacement of the structure in both directions, while increasing the rigidity of the structure and decreasing its period.

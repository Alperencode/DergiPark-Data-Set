Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Instructor Humor Orientation and Students’ Report on Second Language Learning
Özet: Humor is an integral component of any language and therefore has an impact on  the way languages are acquired/learned. Numerous studies have investigated the  role of instructor humor in teaching/learning processes; however, there is little  empirical research on the relationship between instructor humor and learning of a  second language. This paper investigated the relationship of English as a second  language (ESL) instructors’ humor orientation (IHO) to students’ perceptions of  second language learning (SLL). Perceived L2 learning was also examined in  relation to students’ perceived importance of humor (IH) and effects of humor  (EH). Additionally, variations in the interaction between IHO, SLL, IH and EH  across students’ education level, ethnicity and gender were examined. It was found  that high levels of instructor humor orientation associated significantly with  students’ L2 learning perceptions. Also strong correlations were found between  students’ perceived SLL behaviors and their perceived IH and EH. However,  student perceived IHO, SLL, IH and EH did not vary significantly across their  gender, ethnicity, and education level. Implications of the study for second  language education and materials development along with the limitations of the  study have been discussed

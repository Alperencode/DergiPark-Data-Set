Makale Başlığı: Adaptation of the Managerial Behaviors Scale into Turkish: A Validity and Reliability Study
Özet: It is aimed to carry out validity and reliability studies by adapting the Executive Behavior Scale developed by Murphy (2011) into Turkish in this current study. The data of the study were obtained from 453 employees of corporate companies operating in the education, health, banking, insurance, construction, and tourism sectors in Adana and Hatay provinces in Turkey. In order to test the factor structure of the original scale, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed first. The results revealed a six-dimensional scale structure consisting of 29 items in total, explaining 73.53% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test the accuracy and model fit of the EFA findings. CFA results confirmed the item-factor structure (χ²/df= 4.462). DFA fit indices were RMSEA= 0.088; RMR = 0.053; GFI = 0.861; NFI= 0.908; TLI= 0.906; CFI= 0.904; IFI= 0.905. The reliability coefficient (α) of the scale was calculated as 0.969. In addition, the alpha coefficients of the factors were calculated 0.91 for customer orientation and communication; 0.93 for participation and fairness; 0.92 for team building and consistency; 0.85 for authorization; 0.88 for career coaching; 0.86 for flexibility and work-life balance. Thus, it was confirmed that the scale also had internal consistency.

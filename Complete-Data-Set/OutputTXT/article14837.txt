Makale Başlığı: TRANSACTIONS THAT THE PERSON UNDER GUARDIANSHIP CAN MAKE PERSONALLY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE GUARDIAN
Özet: Pursuant to the provision of article 453 of the Turkish Civil Code, a minor or a limited person who has the power to distinguish under guardianship can personally carry out the necessary ordinary legal proceedings regarding the execution of a profession or art, with the permission of the guardianship authority. Pursuant to the relevant provision, the person is exceptionally authorized to engage in commercial and professional activities as if he were fully competent in terms of ordinary legal transactions. This permission can only be given by the guardianship authority. There are no formal requirements for granting the permit. Unless permission is given, transactions made are subject to pending invalidity sanction in terms of the person under guardianship. However, permission does not authorize the person under guardianship to perform prohibited actions as specified in article 449 of the Turkish Civil Code. Pursuant to article 16 of the Turkish Civil Code, unrequited gains can be made to a limited incompetent person under guardianship without the consent of the guardian. Even if these transactions bring great economic advantages to the limited incompetent person under the guardianship, the validity of the transaction depends on the consent of the guardian. In accordance with the provision of article 455 of the Turkish Civil Code, a limited incompetent person under guardianship can personally perform all transactions regarding the management of free goods left to him by his guardian (even if the transaction is of a debiting nature).

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT CULTURE AND RATIONAL SUB-CULTURES ON WORK PERFORMANCE, THE MEDIATING ROLE OF OPENNESS TOWARD ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE
Özet: Organizational culture affects many organizational variables, especially performance. In recent years, the role and importance of organizational culture in increasing job performance, which has an important place in organizational outputs, has been increasing. However, it is thought that various variables may have different contributions to this effect. With this research, the effect of organizational culture on the job performance of employees and the mediating role of openness toward organizational change in this effect were tried to be determined. In research conducted in the defense sector, explanatory findings were obtained by measuring the attitudes of 424 employees. As a result of the research, it was determined that development and rational culture, which are types of outward organizational culture, positively affect the work performance of employees and that openness toward organizational change has a mediating role in this effect.

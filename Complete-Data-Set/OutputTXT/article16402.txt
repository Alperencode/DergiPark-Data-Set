Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF ASSET DIVERSIFICATION ON BANK RISK – EVIDENCE FROM TURKEY
Özet: The main purpose of the paper is to investigate the effect of asset diversification on bank risk. The relationship between diversification strategies and bank risk has been evaluated for a long time. However, there is no consensus about the relationship between asset diversification and bank risk so far. It remains inconclusive whether asset diversification has a positive or negative effect on bank risk. The opposing arguments about diversification are based on Markowitz (1952) modern portfolio theory and Jensen (1986) agency theory. In line with the modern portfolio theory, traditional banking theory suggests that if there is negative correlation between assets diversification is beneficial for banks in terms of risk. In contrast, agency theory argue that diversification strategy is not beneficial because of agency costs. As a measure for bank diversification Laeven and Levine (2007) asset diversification formula is used. Bank risk is discussed in the context of credit risk. Using quarterly data of top 10 Turkish deposit banks from 2010 to 2020, pooled OLS regression results suggest that relationship between asset diversification and risk is positive which supports agency theory and contradicts with traditional banking theory. It can be concluded that diversification is not advantageous in terms of bank risk. This analysis may provide guiding for regulators and bank managers in Turkey as well as in other developing economies.

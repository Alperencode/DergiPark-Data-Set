Makale Başlığı: ETHICS, PERFECT HUMAN, AND ECONOMICS IN THE TRADITION OF FUTUWWA-AKHISM: AN EVALUATION ON INDIRECT BUSINESS ETHICS PRINCIPLES OF THE AKHISM
Özet: Futuwwa or akhism is the institutionalized name of the ideal of building a moral life and society based on the principle of doing good things, not doing or preventing bad things in the Islamic framework. It is understood that the idea of futuwwa is a civilization project based on raising ideal or perfect human (‘insan-ı kamil’) in terms of the series of people it takes as an example/guide and the principles it accepts as a way compass. Of course, some sufis such as Ibn Arabi preferred to explain the subject with deep philosophical considerations, like the authors of the history of thought before and after Islam. This understanding, which has been heavily criticized by a significant part of the Sunni Islamic scholars, makes the issue the subject of a deep philosophical analysis; it is an ideal human imagination that is understood by the circles of morality, mysticism and futuwwa as the perfect human being in general, moralized with the morals of the Qur'an, and living a life in accordance with the compass of revelation. Therefore, we have already dealt with the concept of the perfect human being, which is seen as the purpose function of futuwwa, within this framework. In this respect, in this study, a perfect human being has been analyzed over six of the general (indirect) business ethics principles of futuwwa and akhism. These principles are honesty, generosity, humility, being good-natured and well-spoken, altruism, not looking for fault and being forgiving.

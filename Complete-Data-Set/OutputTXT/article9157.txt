Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the relationships between the attitudes of secondary school students towards robotic activities and the levels of self-regulation, metacognitive awareness
Özet: This study examines secondary school students' attitudes towards robotics, self-regulation skills, and meta-cognition awareness. The research was conducted in the correlational research model, one of the general survey models. The research sample comprised 68 secondary school students who attended a robotic course for two terms. The research data were collected using online data collection tools consisting of two parts. The first part is demographic questions, and the second contains attitudes towards robotics, self-regulation skills, and meta-cognition awareness Scale items.  Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, T-Test, and Pearson Correlation analyses were used to analyze the data. While there was no significant difference between students' attitudes towards robotic activities, self-regulation skills, and metacognitive skills according to their education level of mother and father, a statistically significant difference was found between self-regulation skills and grade level. The self-regulation scores of fifth and sixth grade students are significantly higher than those of seventh grade students. Finally, a high positive correlation was found between students' attitudes towards robotic activities and their self-regulation and metacognitive skills.

Makale Başlığı: Supervisory And Legal Transformation in European Union Banking
Özet: The 2008 crisis showed how quickly and powerfully problems in the financial sector can spread, especially in the currency union, and how such problems directly affect people in Europe. The European banking supervision, which has undergone a major transformation with the crisis, aims to contribute to the safety, soundness of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system by ensuring that banking supervision in the Eurozone is of a high standard and applied consistently to all banks. While the European Central Bank holds the ultimate responsibility in the banking supervision of the European Union, the national authorities fulfill their supervisory duties within a single supervisory mechanism. This structure ensures a strong and consistent audit of all audited entities in the euro area, while making the most of the local and specific knowledge of the national auditors.Although the Single Supervision Mechanism, which is the most important pillar of the European Union banking supervision system, is an important step for the EU banking system to become more effective, the deficient areas of the supervision system will be completed with the full establishment of deposit insurance mechanisms. A single European deposit insurance scheme would ensure uniformity across the Eurozone and facilitate the removal of barriers to liquidity and capital mobility within the single market. This, in turn, will emerge as a factor that will increase the efficiency of the banking sector and economy and enable the EU to compete with the USA and China.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Satisfaction Level in Family-Centered Intensive Care Concept; A Single-Center Survey Study
Özet: Aim: In our study,it was aimed to determine and improve the quality of the intensive care unit(ICU) of our hospital by evaluating the satisfaction perception of patient relatives through a questionnaire.Materials and Methods: The revised version of the questionnaire named FS-ICU-24 was applied to the patients relatives whose patients had been treated for at least 48 hours in Eskişehir Osmangazi University Anesthesia ICU.Results: According to evaluation results of 79 questionnaires that fit the criteria of the study, it was seen that the satisfaction with the decision-making process of the patients with high satisfaction with care was also significantly higher (p<0.01). The lowest satisfaction was related to being involved in the decision-making process and being able to see their patients whenever they wanted.The highest satisfaction rate was in meeting the requests of relatives of patients by ICU staff.Conclusion: The only thing that the relatives of patients who experience anxiety due to the fear of losing a family member want to see their patient impulsively.In our study,similar to the literature, the subject with the lowest satisfaction rate wasn’t being able to see their patients when they wanted.We showed the importance of being able to respond to the expectations of patient relatives in accordance with the family-centered intensive care concept. We found that it is important for the relatives of the patients to feel that they participate in the decision-making process and that this seriously affects the satisfaction rates. We think that research should be done on how family members can be more involved in the decision-making process when planning quality improvement interventions for ICU.

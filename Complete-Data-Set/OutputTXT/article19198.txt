Makale Başlığı: Self-Efficacy, Quality of Life and Care Burden in Caregivers of Patients with Dementia
Özet: Purpose: This study aimed to determine the relationship between self-efficacy, quality of life, and careburden in caregivers of patient with dementia.Method: In a descriptive study, 145 individuals who cared for patients with dementia of the Alzheimer'stype were participated. The data were collected using “Patient Caregiver Presentation Form”, “Self-Efficacy Scale”, “SF-36 Quality of Life Scale”, “Caregiver Burden Scale”, and “Barthel Index”.Results: The caregivers were 77.9% female, 35.9% university graduate, 74.5% married, with an averageage of 53.34±11 years. Our results found a significant negative correlation among the mean scores of theself-efficacy and the care burden of the caregivers (p<0.05). Also, the study showed a significant negative correlation between the mean of the care burden and the quality of life of the caregivers (p<0.05). It was determined that as the dependence level of the patients increased, the caregiver burden of the caregivers increased and their self-efficacy levels decreased (p<0.05).Conclusion and Suggestions: This study showed that there was a negative relationship between selfefficacy and quality of life and care burden in caregivers of patients with alzheimer type dementia. So, it is recommended to do more comprehensive studies and interventions to enhance self-efficacy and quality life of the caregivers of Alzheimer patients.

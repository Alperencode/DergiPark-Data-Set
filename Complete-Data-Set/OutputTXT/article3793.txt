Makale Başlığı: Burhānüddīn en-Nasafī and His Scholary Personality
Özet: Burhānüddīn en-Nasafī (d. 687/1289) is an important scholar who was born in the town of Nasef (Nahsheb) in Transoxiana region (in the city of Karshi in modern-day Uzbekistan) in 600/1203. Nasafī, who organized scientific journeys to the leading scientific centers of the period such as Nesef, Dehlî, Damascus and Baghdad, witnessed a period in which the most difficult political fluctuations in the history of Islam were experienced. It has witnessed the establishment and collapse of many states, the proclamation of new sultanates and bloody wars in the Islamic world. Despite living in such a turbulent period, he passed through a good education stage and succeeded in getting himself accepted to scientific assemblies, and continued his education activities for the rest of his life. Nasafī, who struggled with the ideologies and innovation sects that he considered to be false throughout his life, defended the principle of tawhid and the basic belief principles of the Ahl al-Sunnah against them. Although he followed Ebû Hanîfe (d. 150/767) in fiqh, he adopted Ash'arism in creed under the influence of thinkers such as Ghazali (d. 505/1111) and Fahruddin er-Razi (d. 606/1210). Nasafī, who produced works in different fields, made important contributions to Islamic thought.

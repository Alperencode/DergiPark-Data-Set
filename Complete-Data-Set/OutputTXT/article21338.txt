Makale Başlığı: The promising effects of BMP2 transfected mesenchymal stem cells on human osteosarcoma
Özet: Selective targeting of transfected mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) carrying specific antioncogenes to the tumor was suggested as a treatment option. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) was shown to inhibit the proliferation and aggressiveness of osteosarcoma (OS)  cells.  Here,  we  aimed  to  assess  the  homing  efficiency  of  intraperitoneally  administered  hMSCs  transfected  with  BMP2 to  the  tumoral site and their effects on OS using an orthotopic xenograft murine model. Orthotopic xenograft murine model of OS in six-week-old female NOD/SCID mice using 143B cells was established. hMSCs transfected with BMP2 (BMP2+hMSC) were used. In vivo experiments  performed  on  four  groups  of  mice  that  received  no  treatment,  or  intraperitoneally  administered  BMP2,  hMSCs,  and  BMP2+hMSCs. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were used to evaluate the pathological identification and to assess the dimensions and necrotic foci of the tumor, the features of lung metastases, and immunostaining against p27, Ki-67, and caspase-3 antibodies. The osteogenic differentiation markers BMP2, BMP4, COL1A1, OPN, OCN and PF4 evaluated using RT-PCR. The tumor dimensions  in  the  hMSCs  group  were  significantly  higher  than  those  of  the  remaining  groups  (p  <  0.01).  The  number  of  metastatic  foci in the BMP2+hMSCs group was significantly lower than those of the other groups (p < 0.01). The current results showed that the intraperitoneal route could be efficiently used for targeting hMSCs to the tumoral tissues for effective BMP2 delivery. In this study, the effects of BMP2 transfected hMSCs on human OS and metastasis were promising for achieving osteogenic differentiation and reduced metastatic process.

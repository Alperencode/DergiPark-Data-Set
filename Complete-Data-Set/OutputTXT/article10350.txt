Makale Başlığı: An Essay On Coffee -Circulation of Coffee as a Commercial Commodity-
Özet: Coffee, which we became aware of with the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in the 16th century, contributed to the understanding of the history of colonialism and became one of the most prominent elements of the change of societies. The literary process, in which the taste of conversation is associated with coffee, has turned into books about the taste and making of coffee over time, and coffee houses have become the unchanging places of social life and cultural flow. The production and delivery places of coffee have become the center of struggles for domination and interstate relations rather than the trade of the object that gives pleasure to those who drink it. Coffee and coffeehouses, which spread to many regions, started to be seen in the big cities of Europe such as London, Paris and Vienna through the Ottoman Empire, and it was seen once again that the East was the address of the civilization transition. Over time, when the coffeehouses where this pleasant object was consumed turned into harmful places where activities against the administration were carried out, they were decided be closed down. Ottoman scholars banned coffee at first, but later abolished it; even their judgment that it has some benefits has been possible with social change and better recognition of this product. This political and social process has also revealed the cultural and artistic dimension, and once again the art products and some terms on this subject have revealed that objects change with societies.

Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATION OF THE STATUS OF ENERGY COOPERATIVES IN THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEM
Özet: Social entrepreneurship and the basic principles of cooperatives, which develop to create a solution to a social problem and add value, require using these concepts together. The increase in energy demand with the increasing population increases the initiatives for energy production. However, the energy cooperative model, in which the needs of the community economy and energy production are met locally, and the local benefit is enlarged, has not become widespread enough yet. It is necessary to adopt the social enterprise model by providing the energy production of the cooperatives and to develop the necessary policies in this regard.  In this study, the research method was determined as follows: First of all, international publications on the subject and reports and publications made by the Ministry and its affiliated institutions on a national scale were examined in order to evaluate the secondary data. In addition, academic researches published scientifically and researches made up to date were examined with literature review. This research was carried out in order to evaluate the energy cooperatives in Turkey in the context of social entrepreneurship and to guide the growth of social benefit by realizing successful investments.

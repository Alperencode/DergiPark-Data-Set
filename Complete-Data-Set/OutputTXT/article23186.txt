Makale Başlığı: IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISIONS OF THE COURT OF JURISDICTION, THE CORRECTION OF THE USE CADASTRE REPORT ON THE LANDS (2/B) CLASSIFIED OUT OF THE FORESTLAND
Özet: The use cadastral report is the report prepared for the purpose of determining the users of the immovable properties that have lost their forest quality and have therefore been taken out of the forest boundaries. The immovables subject to the use cadastral record are generally immovables that have not been registered in the title deed as a result of the cadastral activity before. After the 2/B application in term of Forest Code, these immovables are registered in the title deed and registered in the name of the Treasury and are subject to private ownership. These places, which are registered in the name of the Treasury, can be sold by the Treasury to persons determined as users in the cadastral record of use, provided that the relevant conditions are met in terms of Code on Supporting the Development of Forest Villagers, Evaluation of Areas Taken Out of the Forest Boundaries on behalf of the Treasury and Sale of Agricultural Lands Owned by the Treasury. The fact that it is important to be specified as a user in the cadastral record of use causes a correction lawsuit to be filed against the person who are specified as users for any reason in the usage cadastral record. Within the scope of our study, it is aimed to examine the case of correction of user records in the usage cadastre report prepared within the framework of court decisions.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation and Importance of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)-1-Alpha in Adolescents with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Özet: It was aimed at investigating the place of serum hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha level in the diagnosis of adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), its clinical significance and whether or not it can be used as a biomarker. 30 patients with PCOS and 30 healthy adolescent and young adult women with ages ranging between 15 and 22 were recruited in a grade III Women’s Health Education and Research Hospital. A general physical examination, pelvic examination and ultrasonographic evaluation was carried out on each patient. Serum fasting glucose and insulin levels, lipid profile, HIF-1 alpha levels were recorded as the main parameters of patients. No statistically significant differences were found in serum HIF-1 alpha levels between groups. While the mean HIF-1 alpha levels in PCOS patients was higher as compared to the healthy population, this difference was not statistically significant. Waist/hip circumference ratio, serum LH level, LH/FSH ratio and serum androgen levels in patients with PCOS were significantly higher as compared to control cases.  The small number of patients included in the study and the age range covering the adolescence, which is the period that PCOS symptoms and findings have not become clear yet constitute the limitations of our study, and it is possible that they have affected out study results. Place of HIF-1 alpha level in the diagnosis of PCOS must be supported with studies including larger patient groups.

Makale Başlığı: Pre-School Teachers' Experiences in Astronomy Education
Özet: Astronomy subjects and concepts have always been a fascinating subject at the center of children’s attention. As a result, it is critical to reveal pre-school teachers' experiences in astronomy education, to determine how they design activities and carry them out, to determine whether they see themselves as sufficient/incompetent, and to determine the reasons for this. The primary goal of this research is to uncover pre-school teachers' experiences with astronomy education in their classrooms. The research was carried out with 52 pre-school teachers working in the Eastern Black Sea Region. Six questions were asked of the teachers during semi-structured interviews in order to collect data, and the data was analyzed using the content analysis method. According to the findings of the study, children frequently asked their teachers about celestial bodies and astronomy, and teachers felt comfortable and happy while teaching astronomy subjects and concepts. Although the majority of pre-school teachers believe that the pre-school education program is deficient in astronomy, they also believe that the materials and activities they designed compensate for this deficiency. Based on these results, it is suggested that astronomy subjects and concepts be included more prominently in the pre-school education undergraduate program. As a result, designing and implementing exemplary activities can help teacher candidates in their professional lives in the coming years.

Makale Başlığı: Fixed Point Theorem for Single valued Mapping in Convex Partial Symmetric Spaces with an Application
Özet: In this paper, we proved a fixed point theorem for single-valued mapping in convex partial symmetric spaces. In doing so, we extended and generalised the theorem due to Asim et al. [3] by employing a convex structure for single-valued Kannan type contractions. We also provided an illustrative example to support the results and anapplication to integral equation.

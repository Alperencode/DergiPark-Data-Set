Makale Başlığı: AN OVERVIEW OF THE UNIVERSITIES FOUNDED DURING THE REIGN OF ABDULHAMID II AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH TRANSLATION
Özet: Many factors, such as the economy, technology, health, and education, affect and determine the level of development of a society. It would not be incorrect to believe that education is the most influential aspect of society's cultural life. Education is a phenomenon that should be evaluated within the dynamics of every society. In this context, the infrastructure in which educational institutions are offered can be an essential starting point.Madrasahs are the first thing that comes to mind regarding education in the Ottoman period. Various scientific courses were taught in madrasahs, especially Arabic, Persian, and religious studies. Education was revised in the Ottoman Period due to the modernization of education in all international nations; the new generation's focus was shifted to Europe, and the European-style education model was adopted. In this study, the new civilian schools were founded by the Ottoman intellectuals, who realized that they were lagging behind Europe in scientific progress in the last period, with the support and guidance of the state, and the curricula of these schools transferred through translation were discussed.

Makale Başlığı: An Experimental Study on Comparison of Selected Performance Properties of Soybean and Cotton Knitted Fabrics
Özet: In this study, 100% soybean and 100% cotton suprem and pique knitted fabrics were produced. Quality performance parameters, color fastness and spectrophotometric color results of the knitted fabrics were compared. The aim of the study is to reveal the advantages and weaknesses of soybean knitted fabrics compared to cotton knitted fabrics. When the production and test results are examined, soybean fabrics are softer than cotton fabrics. Knitted pique 100% soybean protein fiber fabrics dimensional change is worse than 100% cotton. Air permeability of fabrics made from soybean fiber is better than cotton fabrics therefore it can be provided thermal comfort conditions. Bursting strength of soybean fabrics is as good as cotton fabrics. In the color fastness tests, the fastness values of the soybean fabrics were found to be high and wet rubbing fastness is good. As a result of this study, it was seen that the color fastness, softness, abrasion resistance, air permeability of the soybean knitted were better than cotton fabrics. Soybean fabrics were found to be more pilling than cotton fabrics. When the results of the research are examined, 100% soybean fabrics can be used instead of cotton fabrics.

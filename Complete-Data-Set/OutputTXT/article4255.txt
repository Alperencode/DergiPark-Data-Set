Makale Başlığı: REGULATORY ROLE OF ROLE CONFLICT AND ROLE UNCERTAINTY IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE AND CREATIVITY
Özet: In this research, while examining the relationship between organizational justice and creativity, the moderating role of role conflict and role ambiguity was investigated. In the first stage of the study the relations between the variables were examined by literature review and research hypotheses were formed. In the second stage, a research was conducted on 396 bank employees selected by using convenience sampling method. In the third and final stage, while the relations between the variables were examined with correlation analysis, research hypotheses were tested with regulatory regression analysis. According to the results of the research, it was seen that the dimensions of organizational justice have positive and significant effects on creativity. However, in the relationship between the dimensions of organizational justice and creativity, it has been determined that role conflict does not have a moderator role, while role ambiguity has a moderator role in this relationship. The effect of procedural and interactional justice on the relationship of creativity increases when role ambiguity is low and medium, and this effect decreases when role ambiguity is high. A significant increase was found in the relationship between distributive justice and creativity when role ambiguity was low, and a significant decrease was found when role ambiguity was high. It is thought that the results of the research will contribute to the literature in terms of understanding the moderating effect of role conflict and role ambiguity in the relationship between organizational justice and creativity.

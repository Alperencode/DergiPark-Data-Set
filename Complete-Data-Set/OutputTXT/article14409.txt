Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Morphological Differences on CIGS Thin Film Surface by GLCM Image Processing Method
Özet: In the study, CIGS semiconductor material was deposited on Mo foils and Mo thin films coated with DC sputtering method on glass by co-evaporation method. The topography and average surface roughness of the two groups of Mo substrates were obtained by the AFM device. The thickness of the CIGS thin films was determined as 1.122 µm from the cross-section SEM image. The structural differences of the samples were determined by taking XRD measurements. SEM images were taken at 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000 magnifications from the surface of CIGS thin films deposited on Mo foil and thin film substrates. Haralick texture features of the obtained SEM images were examined by GLCM method, the results obtained were evaluated and the effect of substrate Mo topography on the morphology of CIGS thin films was investigated. According to the calculated Haralick features, the changes from large areas to smaller areas were evaluated. In the images obtained from group A samples, it was determined that the energy value in the range of 0.21 and 0.54, the contrast value between 0.15 and 0.35, the correlation value between 0.66 and 0.65 and the homogeneity value between 0.82 and 0.92. It was observed that the same features differed in group B. The effect of substrate difference on structure and morphology is explained by the differences in Haralick texture features of SEM images.

Makale Başlığı: Filipino Migrant Women in Domestic Work: A Comparative Evaluation Among Turkiye, East Asian, and Middle Eastern Countries
Özet: This study examines the work experiences of female Filipino domestic workers in some countries and presents comparative evaluations between Turkiye and selected countries in the Middle East and East Asia. From this point of view, the data used in the study were collected from different country cases, including Turkiye and selected countries in East Asia and the Middle East. The evaluations were revealed through descriptive analysis with comparison. Several studies, reports, and news about female Filipino domestic workers from these countries were reviewed throughout this research. By comparing the working conditions and their experiences in said countries, it is understood that workers are alone in bearing the consequences of the lack of protection between the walls of private homes. Therefore, this study stresses that immigrant workers’ rights are violated at domestic-related work in many ways. They face severe abuses and human rights violations in some regions where slave-like conditions still exist. As a result, reviewing the existing migration and labour laws should be the first step to be taken by the host countries. As such, sustainable policies should be introduced immediately to reduce the vulnerability of migrant domestic workers and provide adequate protection.

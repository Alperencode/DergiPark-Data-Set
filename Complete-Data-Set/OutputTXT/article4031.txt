Makale Başlığı: Effect of Energy Deficiency at the End of Pregnancy on Sheep and Lamb Birth Weights
Özet: Abstract: This study was carried out in Chios breed pregnant sheep which created experimentally energy deficiency. To determine the effect of low energy feeding on the birth weights of sheep and lambs in the last period of pregnancy. 38 Chios breed sheep, 4-6 years old, were used in the study. The live weight weights of the ewes before the pregnancy were done on the zero day and the other weight weights on the days 120, 127, 134, 141 and 148 of the pregnancy. On the 105th day of pregnancy, pregnant and non-pregnant sheep were divided into 3 groups as normal energy pregnant group (PNE), deficient energy pregnant group (PLE) and non-pregnant normal energy group (N-PNE). From the 106th day of pregnancy to delivery; The pregnant sheep in the PNE group were fed with the ration containing 13% HP and 10 MJ / kg ME, the pregnant sheep in the PLE group were fed with ration containing 13% HP and 8.0 MJ / kg ME. The sheep in the N-PNE group were fed with ration containing 11% HP and 8.8 MJ / kg ME. PLE and N-PNE groups were found to have lower body weight than the PNE group. However, there was no statistical difference between these groups. In all pregnant sheep, body weight was higher than 120 days of pregnancy, it was found to be higher than day 0 (p <0,05) and after 120 days there was no statistically significant difference between groups. In the study, there was no statistically significant difference between the birth weights of PNE and PLE group. This can be explained by the fact that fetal growth is not affected by %13 HP ve 8.0 MJ / kg ME and does not cause serious energy deficiency in animals.

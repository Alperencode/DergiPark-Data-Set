Makale Başlığı: Digital transformation in art and museums
Özet: In this study, the effects of digital transformation and social media on art organizations and art consumption are examined. At the same time, it is discussed to what extent it contributes to the dissemination of art on a social scale and makes it accessible to everyone. Findings obtained by reviewing the current literature, studies and projects are evaluated with a critical view. Digitalization transforms the way we experience and produce works of art, as well as reducing limitations on location, time and money consumption. Enhancing digital media with augmented reality and virtual reality technology enables us to interact extensively with works of art, enabling the transition from a passive experience to an active art experience. Finally, the expansion of the usage areas of social media creates an online socializing effect in the consumption of art, while allowing art organizations to reach the art consumer at lower costs.

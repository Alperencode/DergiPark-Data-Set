Makale Başlığı: Lipase from new isolate Bacillus cereus ATA179: optimization of production conditions, partial purification, characterization and its potential in the detergent industry
Özet: In this study, 341 Bacillus sp. strains were isolated from agricultural soils of Turkey. The potent extracellular lipase producer was selected. It was identified by 16S rRNA, named as Bacillus cereus ATA179. Optimal nutritional and physical parameters for lipase production were determined. Sucrose as the carbon source, (NH4)2HPO4 as the nitrogen source, CaCl2 as the metal ion were obtained. The  best  results  of  physical  parameters  were  stated  at  45°C,  pH  7.0,  shaking  rate  50  rpm,  inoculation  amount  7%  and  inoculum  age  24  h.  ATA179  strain  showed  a  51%  increase  in  enzyme  production  in  the  modified  medium  created  by  optimizing  nutritional  and  physical  conditions.  Optimum  pH  value  and  temperature  were  found  as  6.0  and  55  °C,  respectively.  CaCl2,  Tween  20,  Triton  X-100  had  an  activating  effect  on  enzyme  activity.  Vmax  and  Km kinetic  values  were  found  as  18.28  U/mL  and  0.11  mM,  respectively.  The  molecular  weight  was  determined  as  47  kDa.  Lipase  was  found  to  be  stable  up  to  75  days  at  -20  ºC.  The  potential  of  the  enzyme  in  detergent industry was also investigated. It was not affected by detergent additives, but was found to be effective in removing oils from contaminated fabrics. This new lipase may have potential to be used in detergent industry.

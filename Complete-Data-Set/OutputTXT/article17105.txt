Makale Başlığı: Assessment of Yunus Emre's Awareness in Faith Tourism by the Youth of the Turkic World: The Case of Kastamonu University Faculty of Tourism
Özet: From past to present, Yunus Emre has been a respected figure in many parts of Anatolia as a guide with his divine love. For this reason, there are still many people who want to follow Yunus Emre's path. It is known that there are more than one tomb of Yunus Emre in the geography of the Turkish world, and people visit these shrines to pay their respects to him. When these visits are evaluated within the scope of faith tourism, it shows that more people over middle age adopt the Sufi love that Yunus Emre shed light on. But it is clear that Yunus Emre, which also occupies a very important place in terms of our culture, should also know about young people. Considering the importance of 2021, Yunus Emre's death is 700. being a period of years and entering UNESCO's list of anniversaries, the impact it has caused on the youth of the Turkic world comes to the fore. Therefore, the study has two goals. Its first goal is to measure how much young people know and know Yunus Emre, and the other is to introduce Yunus Emre's words and works that he left behind to the youth. In this study, students of the Faculty of Tourism of Kastamonu university were selected as a sample. In the study, 280 students were surveyed and the awareness levels of young people on Yunus Emre were examined. As a result, it was revealed that young people did not know Yunus Emre enough and confused most of the information they knew about Yunus Emre with other Sufi leaders.

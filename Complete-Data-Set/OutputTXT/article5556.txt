Makale Başlığı: Dodder (Cuscuta sp.) Extract Ameliorates Liver Fibrosis in Bile Duct-Ligated Rats
Özet: Objective: The aim is to examine the possible protective effect of Cuscuta sp. extract against liver damage induced by biliary obstruction in rats. Materials and Methods: To induce biliary obstruction, the bile duct ligation (BDL) method was used. Sprague Dawley rats were allocated to 4 groups: Control (C), Cuscuta (CUS), bile duct ligation (BDL), and bile duct ligation + Cuscuta (BDL+CUS). Control and BDL rats were given physiological saline (SF), while CUS and BDL+CUS groups were administered 250 mg/ kg of Cuscuta extract by oral gavage. At the end of 28th day, the rats were decapitated, serum and tissue samples were collected, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and direct and total bilirubin (DB and TB) levels were determined in blood samples. In liver tissues, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hydroxyproline, and sodium–potassium ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase) levels were determined. Results: Serum samples of rats with cholestasis had high ALT, AST, DB, and TB levels, while TGF-β, 8-OHdG, and hydroxyproline concentrations were found to be significantly high in tissues. Hepatic Na+/K+-ATPase levels were decreased through biliary obstruction. Biochemical parameters were drastically reversed by Cuscuta care; also, this was supported histologically. Conclusion: Results showed that Cuscuta extract, through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, provided protection against oxidative injury by biliary obstruction. Also, these results confirm the traditional use of Cuscuta sp. as hepatoprotective.

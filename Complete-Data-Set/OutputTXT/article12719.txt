Makale Başlığı: Some Hadı̄ths About the Conquest of Alexandria by a Muslim Group From al-Andalus
Özet: This article discusses the conquest of Alexandria by a Muslim group from al-Andalus. In the relevant context, it aims to examine this conquest and the hadı̄ths related to it in detail. The author firstly presents a detailed story of this conquest through relevant historical documents; then he cites nine hadı̄ths that related to this conquest in the Nuʿaym Ibn Ḥammād’s Kitāb al-Fitan which one of the oldest eschatological books that extant. While discussing these eschatological hadı̄ths, he first makes a comparison in terms of content and claims that the prophecies expressed here actually may be predictions based on some simultaneous events. In addition, he reveals that there are many aspects of these hadı̄ths that are inconsistent with each other and with historical facts in terms of content. Then, by applying some dating methods (tpq and taq), he makes some determinations about the emergence dates of these hadı̄ths. As a result of these determinations, he records that all the hadı̄ths in question were not fabricated by Nuʿaym and he was just content to collect the hadı̄ths about the conquest of Alexandria. According to the author, the main responsible of this fabrication are probably some narrators from the third generation, whose names are frequently mentioned in eschatological hadı̄ths; however, the issue that Nuʿaym is responsible for here is related to the transmission of these hadı̄ths; because Nuʿaym tried to eliminate the disconnection in the chain of narration by doing tadlı̄s.

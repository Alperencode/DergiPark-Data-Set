Since 26 items of the scale were found suitable by experts, the scale was first applied to 289 students by 30 teachers for validity and reliability analyzes including statistical methods. Exploratory factor analyzes were performed with the data obtained, and it was determined that 19 items covered 62% of the total variance with a single factor structure. Then, 200 students were evaluated by 20 teachers by using a 19-item scale for confirmatory factor analyses; and based on the data obtained, a total of 17 items could reach appropriate values (X²/sd [CMIN/DF]: 1.453, CFI: .970, GFI: .907, RMSEA: .048) but it was determined that 2 items should be removed. In addition, in order to determine the reliability of the scale, the data of 17 items were tested with Cronbach Alpha and a bit value of .941 which can be considered high was found. At the end of the studies carried out, the Speaking Skills Expert Evaluation Scale took its final form consisting of 17 items and one dimension.

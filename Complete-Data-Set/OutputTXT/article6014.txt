Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP OF HEDONIC HUNGER WİTH OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS
Özet: Hedonic hunger is defined as the urge to enjoy food and to eat even if hunger does not occur physiologically. Hedonic hunger causes more energy intake with diet for pleasure rather than metabolic need, and it causes an increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, especially in childhood and adolescence. Due to the acquisition of healthy eating behaviors in adolescence, measures to be taken in order to maintain body weight and prevent obesity gain importance in this period. In recent years, it has been stated that obesity, especially in childhood, is caused by an increase in dietary energy, on the other hand, a decrease in energy expenditure. In adolescents, high consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages has been associated with increased dietary energy intake, increased body weight in adolescence and adulthood, and a higher risk of chronic disease. In this review, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between hedonic hunger and obesity in children and adolescents.

Makale Başlığı: Theory of Divine Attributes in the Islamic Cultural Tradition
Özet: The difficulty of talking about God is because He is a separate entity from the world. Allah made some proportions to himself in the Qur'an, and spoke about himself in this way. It can therefore be assumed that divine revelation aims to be understood. This is closely related to the person being the addressee of the offer. The assumption in question reveals that it is necessary to understand the proportions made to God. Muslim theologians, being aware of the difficulty of speaking about God, turned to this theological problem and tried to find a solution. In this equation with many unknowns, they tried to solve some of the known ones.The purpose of this study is not to judge the schools through the theological language they developed about adjectives. It is not aimed within the framework of this study to reveal their theories about adjectives. In this study, it has been tried to show the basic starting points in the assumptions of Islamic theological schools regarding the theory of adjectives (Attributes of God), and the theological perceptions that they are worried about in expressing their claims. In this respect, our study is a purely theoretical and conceptual study. Making reference to theologians from different schools from time to time, on the other hand, aims to test and verify our theoretical construct from the field.

In order to achieve this goal, pictures of natural disasters were shown to 20 preschool children in a primary school in Iğdır, and it was observed whether they knew about the disaster and how they would react if it did. Children's reactions and attitudes towards what they see were observed. Since there was no direct interview, an ethics committee document was not required. Considering the disasters examined, fire, avalanche, flood, earthquake and landslide were examined as the most common disasters for children. Although the most known disaster is earthquake, it has been revealed that children do not know enough how disasters occur and what to do when they occur.

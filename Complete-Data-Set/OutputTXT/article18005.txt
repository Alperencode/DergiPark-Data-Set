Makale Başlığı: Effect of motivational behaviors and race/ ethnicity on academic success in physical  therapy students: a preliminary study
Özet: Objectives: Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program admissions criteria and markers indicative of academic success appear to be mismatched. Acceptance into a DPT program implies that students have developed self-regulated learning strategies however, motivation behaviors are not typically assessed during the admissions process. The aim of this study was to determine direct effects of motivational behaviors and race/ethnicity on academic success and the moderating effect of race/ethnicity on motivational behaviors. Methods: Thirty-three first-year DPT students participated during their first foundational course, clinical anatomy. Motivation subscales from the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ) were used to assess student motivation behaviors which were then compared to course grades. Results: Self-efficacy for learning and performance was significantly correlated with course grade [r(31)=0.44, p< 0.05]. Course grade differed at a statistically significant level by race/ethnicity [t(31)=2.93, p<0.01]. Race/ethnicity (B=0.05, SE=0.01, b=0.42, p<0.008) and self-efficacy for learning and performance (B=0.02, SE=0.01, b=0.39, p<0.01), remained significantly related to course grade. Conclusion: Self-efficacy for learning and performance and ethnicity are factors that determine academic success and could be utilized in DPT programs to aid in the development of teaching strategies to support students.

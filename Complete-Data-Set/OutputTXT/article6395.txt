Makale Başlığı: Edible films and coatings for food
Özet: Objective: Edible films and coatings are substances consisting of thin-layered edible resources formed on the surface of the food, which play an important role in the preservation, extension of shelf life, distribution and marketing of food. It is used to protect food from mechanical, chemical, physical and microbiological hazards. Edible films and coatings have usages in food applications due to their functional, mechanical and optical properties, gas barrier effect, and structural resistance against water and microorganisms. In this review, the general properties of edible films and coatings, their application to foods and their use in the food industry are discussed.Conclusion: Films and coatings, when applied as a thin layer, act as a barrier between food and the environment, extending shelf life without affecting product quality. These coatings improve the nutritional and sensory quality of food. In addition, its properties can be improved by adding components such as antimicrobial compounds, antioxidants, essential oils, minerals and vitamins. The carcinogenic effect and waste problem of plastics used in traditional food packaging have encouraged the development of biodegradable materials. Edible packaging extends the shelf life of foods compared to plastic packaging, creating a selective barrier for water, oxygen and light. When edible films and coatings are prepared properly, they can fulfill all the functions of a functional package.

Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Theoretical Terms Within The Framework of Scientific Realism and The Observation Problem
Özet: The success of scientific theories depends on enabling of explaning, predicting and observations. Theoretical terms, which form an important part of the success of the theories, enable the explanation by giving regularity to the empirical mass. They can not reconcile with empiricism due to theoretical terms are not observable. While scientific realism asserts to described the world accurately, anti-realists imply that science contains speculations independent of experiment on this unobservable field. However, theoretical terms have operational definitions that can be explained with factual contents, and the whole process is controlled by mathematical calculations. On the other hand, to overcome the observation problem of theoretical terms, the empirical adequacy offered instead of truth can not set standards for observation. Quantum physics, which is kenned as indeterminism and assumed to support instrumentalism, is problematic and does not provide enough information to come out against scientific realism.

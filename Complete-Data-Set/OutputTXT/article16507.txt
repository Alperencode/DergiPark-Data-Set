Makale Başlığı: New Hematological Indices as Markers of Inflammation and High Disease Activity in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
Özet: (MLR) ratio, systemic inflammatory index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and systemic inflammation aggregate index (AISI) were evaluated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. It was aimed to determine the importance of new hematological markers as an inflammation marker in SLE, evaluate the relationship of these parameters with SLE disease activity (DA), and investigate their sensitivity in showing very high DA. 91 SLE patients and 100 healthy controls were included in the study. The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was used to evaluate the DA. SLE patients were divided into patients with SLEDAI-2K <20 and ≥20. NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, SIRI, AISI were all found to be significantly higher in SLE patients compared to the healthy controls; respectively (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.022, p=0.016, p<0.001, p=0.007). NLR (p=0.040), SII (p=0.012), SIRI (p=0.002) and AISI (p=0.003) were significantly higher in patients with SLEDAI-2K≥20 than patients with SLEDAI-2K<20. A positive correlation was observed between SLEDAI-2K and NLR, SII, SIRI and AISI; respectively (r=0.216) (p=0.039), (r=0.265) (p=0.011), (r=0.3258) (p=0.002), (r=0.309) (p=0.003). The sensitivity of hematological parameters to predict very high DA was evaluated with the ROC curve. SIRI, AISI, SII, and NLR had the highest sensitivity. In this study, it has been shown that the new hematological markers are effective in demonstrating inflammation in SLE, are associated with very high DA, and have a high sensitivity in detecting very high DA.

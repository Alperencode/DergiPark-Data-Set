Makale Başlığı: AN EVALUATION ON THE ISLAMIC PERIOD GLAZED CERAMICS IN THE VAN MUSEUM
Özet: AbstractIn this study, bowl, plate, bowls, tray, inkwells, medicine containers (albarello), jar and jugs produced with monochromatic glazed, sgraffito and underglaze decoration techniques belonging to the Islamic period in the Van Museum are discussed. Very few examples among the works examined were unearthed during the excavations of Van Castle and the Old City of Van. A large part of the ceramics was brought to the museum through purchases and grants. The works belonging to the Seljuk, Principalities, Ottoman, Safavid and Qajar periods were examined in terms of material, technique, form and decoration, and the similarities and differences between the periods were emphasized. The ceramics grouped according to their techniques were evaluated according to their dough, form and ornamental characteristics and a dating proposal was made. It is observed that the examined containers exhibit features close to the stylistic lines of the periods they belong to, with their qualities. It is thought that inkwells and medicine containers from monochrome glazed containers have a stylistic appearance from the 12th-13th century, while bowls, jars, trays and jugs have a continuous stylistic appearance from the 17th to the 20th centuries. It has been observed that the ceramics in the Sgraffito technique have some characteristics that can be dated to the 13th-14th century, and the underglaze decoration samples to the 15-20th century.

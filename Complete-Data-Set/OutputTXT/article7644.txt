Makale Başlığı: Synthesis of Nano Iron Oxide and Investigation of Its Use as a Fertilizer Ingredient
Özet: Faced with famine and environmental problems day by day, the world population has begun to explore the rational use of arable land. It is very important to minimize soil pollution caused by excessive fertilization used in this area. In this study, pomegranate fruit extract was used as the reducing medium of the green synthesis method. After characterizing the nano-iron oxide particles (Fe2O3 NPs) produced under optimized conditions, its effects on plants were investigated. To examine the effects of Fe2O3 NPs on plant growth, experimental random plots were set up with the plant Chinese Fringe Flower plant (Loropetalum chinense) grown under sterile and homogeneous conditions. The number of shoots per explant, which was 2.76 in the standard iron-containing medium, was obtained as 4.00 in the Fe2O3 NPs1.00 mg/L medium. From these results, it was determined that the best medium for plant growth and reproduction was Fe2O3 NPs-1.00 mg/L. For this reason, it was thought that domestic nano fertilizer formulations can be used to increase agricultural productivity and create value-added contributions to countries in the production of different plants that cause the least damage to the environment.

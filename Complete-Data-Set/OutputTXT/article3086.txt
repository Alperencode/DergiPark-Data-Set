Makale Başlığı: Determination of Rheological Properties of Alternative Flour Substituted Doughs
Özet: All over the world, healthy foods, functional foods, diet foods and many similar terms are on the agenda. Consumers are offered different types of foods for a healthy diet. To this end, studies to improve the functional properties of bread have gained momentum. One of the ways to improve the functional properties of bread is to use flours with more functional properties than wheat flour. However, the effects of the added flours on the rheology of the dough are also different. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of flours (buckwheat (10-30%), carob (3, 6, 9, and 12), chickpea (10-50%), oat (10-50%), and barley (10-50%)) in different proportions added to bread flour on the rheological properties of the dough. The Mixolab® (Chopin) instrument was used to determine the rheological properties. A standard protocol for flour analysis was used for the analysis of bread flour and other flour mixtures. Various rheological and other dough properties were determined, such as water holding capacity, development time, stability, amylase activity, and degree of flour retrogradation. Using the obtained Mixolab® curve, C1 values for water retention and stability, C2 values for protein quality, C3 values for starch gelatinization, C4 values for amylase activity, and C5 values for degree of starch degradation were measured. C1 changed between 1.05 and 1.16 Nm, C2 between 0.33 and 0.58 Nm, C3 between 1.22 and 2.13 Nm, C4 between 0.96 and 1.98 Nm, and C5 between 0.95 and 2.81 Nm depending on the flour ratio and type used. As a result of the tests, it was determined that the most suitable flour for bread flour profile is 30% barley flour, 20% oat flour, 9% carob flour and 20% buckwheat flour, separately for each added flour.

Makale Başlığı: Metaphorical Opinions of Teacher Candidates on the Concept of Classroom Management
Özet: Today, metaphor means creating a perception of thinking that embodies concepts that are similar to each other in general. At the same time, it directs the individual to think creatively, imagine and establish relationships between concepts. The fact that pre-service teachers from different branches produce metaphors about classroom management allows to approach the literature from a different perspective. This study was carried out in order to reveal the metaphorical views of teacher candidates about the concept of classroom management. In the method of the study, the phenomenology design was used as a qualitative research design. In the 2021-2022 academic year, 166 teacher candidates from different branches, studying in the 4th grade of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Education, participated in the study. While analyzing the data in the study, descriptive analysis and content analysis methods were used. In the semi-structured interview form, “Classroom management …………. like this; because……………” sentence was asked to be filled by the teacher candidates. As a result of the analysis of the data, 80 metaphors emerged. Metaphors are grouped under 9 different categories according to their common features. As a result, it was seen that pre-service teachers have creative, rich, cognitive and affective approaches about classroom management.

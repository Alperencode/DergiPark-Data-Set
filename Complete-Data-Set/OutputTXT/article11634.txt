Makale Başlığı: Objections to Occasionalism and Corresponding Answers: A Dialectical Analysis
Özet: According to occasionalism, God constantly intervenes in the universe with his infinite will and power, and therefore he is the only true cause of all cause-effect relationships in the universe. All the agents we observe regarding the cause-effect relationship are in fact occasional causes of divine intervention. This paper firstly deals with the basic claims of occasionalism from the perspective of Ghazali and Malebranche with a descriptive narrative. The paper then analyzes the objections to occasionalism and replies from occasionalism in a dialectical manner. The paper claims that occasionalism is an approach with internal consistency but does not respond to objections outside of this perspective of internal consistency. Finally, the paper reveals that within the scope of contemporary philosophy of mind, occasionalism seems not to allow for scientific studies on the nature of the mind and consciousness and advocates a mysterian position.

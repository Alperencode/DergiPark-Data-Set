Makale Başlığı: PRODUCTION PROBLEMS ON  MATERIAL EXTRUSION BASED 3D PRINTERS
Özet: Material extrusion is an additive manufacturing method by melting the wire form thermoplastic material to the desired area on the printing table with the help of a moving nozzle. With its low cost, material extrusion is the most commonly used additive manufacturing method. However, it is one of the most problematic technology due to the faults encountered during production. The slicer software, hardware of the 3D printer, and the production parameters used during production can lead to production problems. In this study, the problems experienced in 3D printers using the material extrusion method were evaluated. The identified problems were classified. Although such production problems are more common in low-cost printers, they are also an important problem in high-cost professional printers. Classified problems in this study can be applied to all 3D printers using the material extrusion method. Twenty-one fundamental production difficulties have been classified. These production problems are the problems that make the product unusable or interrupt production process. Each production problem identified in the study was presented with detailed visuals, comprehensive information given about the causes of the problem, and solution advices suggested.

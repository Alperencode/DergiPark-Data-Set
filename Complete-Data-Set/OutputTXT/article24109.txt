Makale Başlığı: The Presidency Of Religious Affairs In The Spiral Of Exclusive And Passive Secularism
Özet: This study aims to compare the position of the Presidency of Religious Affairs in the early period of the Republic with the position of the Presidency during the AK Party government. As a result of this comparison, the question arises whether the secularism approach of the Republic of Turkey has changed. For this reason, the study starts with the theoretical framework of secularism. Passive secularism, which the state does not interfere with the religious sphere, and the exclusionary secularism, which the state regulates the religious sphere, constitute the two sides of the modern state's religion policies. The Republic of Turkey used exclusionary secularism practices more intensively in the early period. However, over time, the state's policies on the field of religion entered a phase of softening due to various reasons. The AK Party government, which has been in power since 2003, can be considered as one of the peak points of this softening. As a result of the policy change of the state in the field of religion, the position of the Presidency of Religious Affairs has also changed. The study traces this change and discusses the question of whether this change can theoretically be considered as a transition from exclusionary secularism to passive secularism. It is claimed that the changes in the religious policy arose the need for a revision of the secularism form of the Republic of Turkey.

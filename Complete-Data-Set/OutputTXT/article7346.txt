Makale Başlığı: All Dehn Fillings of the Whitehead Link Complement are Tetrahedron Manifolds
Özet: In this paper we show that Dehn surgeries on the oriented components of the Whitehead link yield tetrahedron manifolds of Heegaard genus $\le 2$. As a consequence, the eight homogeneous Thurston 3-geometries are realized by tetrahedron manifolds of Heegaard genus $\le 2$. The proof is based on techniques of Combinatorial Group Theory, and geometric presentations of manifold fundamental groups.

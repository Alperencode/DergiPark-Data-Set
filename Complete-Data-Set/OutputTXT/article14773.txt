Makale Başlığı: AN ASSESSMENT ON AUDIT OF MUNICIPAL COMPANIES
Özet: Municipalities have been active in various ways in the performance of local joint services in the historical process. In particular, depending on the diversification and differentiation of the nature of local services over time, service delivery models and processes had to be improved as a requirement of the new public administration approach. In addition to this important change, service provision had to be made more effective, economical and efficient due to the expansion of urban areas and the increase in their number. In this process, it became necessary for municipalities to produce and provide services through their companies. However, it has been understood over time that the control of these structures is as important as their management. In this article, an evaluation has been made about the supervision of municipal companies in a temporal period. Subsequently, various suggestions were made in order to eliminate the deficiencies identified in the supervision of municipal companies.

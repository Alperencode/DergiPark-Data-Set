Makale Başlığı: VALUES EDUCATION IN ISPARTA LEGEND
Özet: Values are qualities that encompass the material, spiritual, cultural phenomena of the society in which it is lived and guide the society to the ideal. These qualities, which constitute the basis of social culture, are tasked with ensuring social control in society. Societies that want to ensure continuity in unity and togetherness have to pass these values on to next generations. Thus, the first goal is to make society more livable by ensuring the functioning of the values mechanism in society. The myth, which is one of the products of Turkish folk literature, plays a major role in this social transfer and goal. Both the relationship of myths with reality and the educational message aspect make myths the bearer of culture from the past to the present. As a matter of fact, myths are the mirror of society; they are reflective of the values that make us who we are. The mythical stories engraved in the memory of society in the historical process have become extensions of society by internalizing values. It is necessary to give importance to our legends, which are a valuable resource with short and intensive teachings wıth regard to maıntaın to contınuıty and functıonalıty of Turkish community educationThe lack of these values is beginning to be felt in today's Turkey. In this study, we tried to interpret that compiled legend from Isparta areas in terms of educational messages and values education.

Makale Başlığı: Examination of the Associations of Happiness, Self-Efficacy, Peer Relationships and Need for Social Approval Among Adolescents
Özet: In present study, it was aimed to determine the associations among the psychosocial indicators of happiness in adolescents attending high school. Self-efficacy, peer relations, and the need for social approval were considered as psychosocial indicators. The study group of the research consisted of 637 high school students. The ages of the students in the research group ranged from 13 to 19 (M=15.56; SD= 1.19). The results of the analysis showed that there were significant associations among adolescent happiness and self-efficacy, the need for peer relationships and social approval, and between self-efficacy and the need for peer and social approval. According to the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, it was determined that peer relations and the need for social approval had a partial mediating role in the association between adolescent happiness and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy, peer relationships, and the need for social approval accounted for 54% of the total variance of adolescent happiness. In the current study, it was concluded that self-efficacy, peer relations, and the need for social approval, which were considered as psychosocial indicators, were significant predictors of adolescent happiness. The findings were discussed in line with the literature and suggestions were presented.

Makale Başlığı: Doubt in terms of Kalam and Philosophy
Özet: The concept of doubt has been the common issue of religions and philosophy in the epistemological sense in the historical process. This concept, which is used in depth and diversity in the history of philosophy, has been used more functionally for research and questioning purposes in Islamic thought. In this context, three types of doubt can be mentioned in terms of philosophy: septic, methodical and fideistic. While skepticism, which is the first of these doubt types in Islamic thought, has been criticized as being equivalent to denialism, skeptical fideism has not been accepted in the context of religious texts that give importance and value to reason and research. Methodical doubt has been encouraged both in religious texts and Islamic thought in order to reach true and precise knowledge in terms of research and questioning. For this reason, in this study, starting from the Ancient Age, the types of doubt and doubt will be examined in terms of philosophy, then these types of doubt will be compared in terms of religious texts and theological thought, and their importance and value in terms of Islamic thought will be revealed.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Activities in Dogs Infected with Canine Distemper Virus
Özet: Supraphysiological reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. One of the diseases pathophysiologically associated with ROS accumulation is canine distemper (CD). The purpose of this study was to compare lipid peroxidation and antioxidant biomarkers in dogs infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) to healthy dogs. The animals in this study consisted of a total of 20 dogs, 10 CDV-positive dogs (Trial group) aged 0–12 months of different breeds and sexes, and 10 healthy dogs (Control group) aged 0–12 months of different breeds and sexes. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits using serum samples. While the activities of GSH and SOD were statistically lower in CDV positive animals compared to healthy animals (p<0.05), the level of TBARS was significantly higher (p<0.05). In conclusion, current study findings that CDV increases lipid peroxidation activity in serum while decreasing antioxidant enzyme levels may be useful for future research.

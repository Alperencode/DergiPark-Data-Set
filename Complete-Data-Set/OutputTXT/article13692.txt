Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Emotional Labor on the Performance of Security Forces: A Conceptual and Literature Focused Review
Özet: The management of emotions in accordance with the requirements of the job and the organization is explained by the concept of Emotional Labor. Choosing the appropriate emotional labor strategy is a critical process, especially for the security force personnel, considering the victims and criminals they serve, and the public power in their hands. Emotional labor has many negative effects on organizational performance and the psychological health of the employee. In this context, it is aimed to examine the effects of emotional labor on security organizations and their personnel. For this purpose, 24 studies presenting empirical results from publications in various indexes (Ulakbim, Scopus, Web of Science, and Proquest) were discussed in detail. Suggestions were made to increase the effectiveness and performance of the security forces and to reduce the effects of emotional labor. It is considered that the results of the study will contribute significantly to the emotional labor literature, while raising awareness about the development of the socio-emotional abilities of the security forces, who play an important role in the fine line between chaos and order, and increase their individual and organizational performance.

Makale Başlığı: A Legal Examination of Anti-Islamism in France
Özet: Anti-immigrant and anti-Arab/North African racism in France has evolved into racism against Muslims since the 2000s. When it comes to the first quarter of the 2000s, it is seen that terms such as Anti-Islamism, Islamophobia, Islamophobic hate speech and the integration of Muslim women are used by supranational organizations. The problem of racial discrimination in France focuses on issues such as employment, education, housing, access to goods and services, and violence. In France, it is possible to say that the sources of discriminatory treatment against Muslims are actually based on the French Constitution. Namely, it should be noted that discriminatory treatments occur as a result of misinterpretation and implementation of the principle of secularism and equality before the law in the Constitution. Anti-Islamic legal practices in France are revealed especially by supranational organizations and their quasi-judicial organs, and recommendations are made to eliminate the said discriminatory treatment.

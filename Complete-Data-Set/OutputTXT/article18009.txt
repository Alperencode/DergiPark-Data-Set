Makale Başlığı: Radio-anatomical aspects of a rare case: interpeduncular lipoma
Özet: Intracranial lipomas can be associated with other congenital abnormalities, but they are commonly found incidentally on imaging studies. Although the location of intracranial lipomas can be quite variable, they are extremely rare in interpeduncular fossa. We report a case of interpeduncular lipoma with its radio-anatomical features in terms of distinction with pathologies that can appear similarly, as the unexpected location of rare cases can be challenging for radiologists. The MR images of a 55-year-old male patient suffering from episodic dizziness attacks and impaired walking showed two different lipoma masses in interpeduncular fossa and chiasmatic cistern which are isointense with adipose tissue in T1, T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. Intracranial lipomas can be located in the corpus callosum and almost in all cisterns, however they are extremely rare in interpeduncular fossa. Due to the mass effect, the structures located in close proximity of the lipomas should be evaluated.

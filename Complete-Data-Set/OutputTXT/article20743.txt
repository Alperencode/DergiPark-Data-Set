Makale Başlığı: Application of full cost and normal cost according to IAS-2 inventories
Özet: Even though there are numerous approaches to charging general production cost elements to the products, the IAS 2  Inventories  standard  mandates  using  the  normal  cost  method  in  certain  circumstances. The  cost  results calculated  using  the  normal  and  full  cost  methods  are  different  from  each  other.  In  particular,  as  long  as businesses that use the full cost method are not running at full capacity, their costs will be calculated higher than those that use the normal cost method. This will put them at a disadvantage when it comes to pricing.Full cost and normal cost calculations based on the assumption of a single process or product may not yield accurate cost results.Accepting  normal  capacity  as  practical  capacity  will  result  in  the  imposition  of  idle  capacitycosts  on product costs, as well as incorrect management accounting decisions. In addition, different deferred tax effects will occur when tax procedure law and IAS/IFRSare compared.In this regard, this study compares normal and total  costs,  which  vary  according  to  normal  capacity  and  practical  capacity  levels,  for  three  distinct  primary production  cost  centers  and  three  distinct  products.  Furthermore,  deficiencies  discovered  in  applications  were addressed,  and  recommendations  were  provided  for  proper  cost  computation,  accounting  record  keeping,  and reporting.

Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND ITS EFFECTS ON PARENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROCESS
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the functionality of disabled children and its effects on parents during the Covid-19 pandemic.Methods: A total of 168 people, including 84 disabled children and 84 mothers, were included in the study. The Pediatric Disability Assessment Inventory (PEDI) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) were used for children with disabilities. The Zarit Burden Scale (ZBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) were applied to the mothers to question musculoskeletal disorders.Results: There was no correlation between care burden score and PEDI, total score, self-care and mobility scores (p>0.05). A moderately negative (r=-0.306; p<0.01) significant linear relationship was found between care burden score and social function score. There was no significant linear relationship between the fatigue severity score and PEDI total score, self-care, mobility and social function scores (p>0.05). No correlation was found between care burden score and fatigue severity score (p>0.05). For the last 12 months, only the pain in the lumbar region of the parents prevented them from doing their usual work. It was determined that the most aching body parts of the parents who complained of musculoskeletal pain during the last 12 months were in the waist, neck, shoulder, back, and knee regions.Conclusion: As a result, no relationship was found between the functionality of disabled children and their parents’ influences during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES AT THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL IN TURKEY IN 2014-2019
Özet: The analysis of policies in the public sector is monitored with various indicators and new policies are determined according to the changes. The official reports highlighted that the distribution of health human resources, which should be benefited equally by all individuals in public health services in Turkey, is not equal on a provincial basis and that policies tolerating this are implemented. In this study, the change in the distribution of health human resources in 81 provinces of Turkey between the years 2014 and 2019 was analyzed using multi-criteria decision-making techniques. The findings obtained as a result of the analysis can be listed as follows. i) To eliminate the inequities between provinces, the priorities of health human resources have been determined. ii) In different periods, the rank of the provinces expressing the relative status of the health human resources compared to the country has been determined. iii) Interpretations of the obtained rankings from different perspectives are presented.

Makale Başlığı: "Subaltern Portraits in Waiting for the Barbarians, Sea of Poppies and The Afghan Girl"
Özet: Oppression against the subaltern women has always been a significant issue. They have not onlystruggled through many challenges caused by imperial powers but also suffered from the traditional, religiousand social norms imposed by their own patriarchy. Although it is considered that the West is the only saviour forthe East, it has never become true as it has been nothing but devastation, poverty, identity struggle and achallenging life in refugee camps. In order to avoid misinterpretation of the subaltern women, it is now up tointellectuals, writers and journalists to make their voices heard and reveal all the facts about them. In this sense,Coetzee and Ghosh draw a perfect picture and become the voice of the subaltern women under the domination oftheir own patriarchy and imperial powers all around the world. They, in a way, tell the story of millions ofsubaltern women like Sharbat Gula, who was objectified both by her patriarchal society and by the West tojustify its violent acts upon the East. Intertwined between colonists and patriarchy the subaltern is alwayssubaltern and it is almost impossible for them to express themselves as they do not have autonomy and are notindependent from dominant foreign groups. Thus, the aim of this study is to discuss how the subalternity ispictured through the female portraits in the novel Waiting For The Barbarians by John Maxwell Coetzee andSea of Poppies by Amitav Ghosh along with the real life story of the Afghan Girl, Sharbat Gula, who wasphotographed by Steve McCurry.

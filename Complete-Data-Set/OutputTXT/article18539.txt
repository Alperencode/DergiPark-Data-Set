Makale Başlığı: Retrospective evaluation of liver transaminase abnormalities in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients according to   liver  biopsy results
Özet: Background  and  Aim: Histopathological examination of liver tissue is often performed with percutaneous liver biopsy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the causes and results of liver biopsy performed for various reasons in our clinic between years 2016 and 2019.Materials and Methods: 554 of 750 liver biopsies performed between July 2016 and January 2019 were included in the study. Pathology results of liver biopsies, the clinical information of the same patients were  obtained from the patient files. Biopsy indications and results of the patients were evaluated retrospectively.Results: 554 liver biopsy results (M:323, 58.4%; mean age: 45±14.3) were included in the study. The most common liver biopsy indication in our hospital, was determined as the biopsies of patients with chronic hepatitis B. This indication was followed by liver biopsies performed to examine non-viral liver enzyme elevations.The pathology results were  listed as; chronic hepatitis B (65%), NAFLD/NASH (16%), AIH (3%), Hepatitis C (3%) respectively.Discussion: The diversity in liver biopsy results shows the importance of histopathological evaluation. In order to reach healthy data, multi-centered prospective randomized controlled studies with  larger  populations are needed.

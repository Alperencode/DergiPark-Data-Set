Makale Başlığı: Clinical Stress Levels of Senior Nursing Students in The Operating Room And Surgical Inpatient Practices
Özet: Clinical practices, which have an important place in nursing education, are also a source of stress for the student. To examine the clinical stress levels of senior nursing students in the operating room and surgical clinics. It was descriptive and cross-sectional study and conducted at a university in Turkey, in 2019-2020. In the study, 89 of the senior nursing students took part in the operating room and 81 in the surgical clinics. Quantitative data were collected by sociodemographic clinical characteristics form and the Pagana Clinical Stress Questionnaire. The operating room stress score of the senior nursing students was 27.41±8.75. According to the clinics, there was a significant difference between the clinical stress score of the first day. The highest clinical stress score belonged to the students who practiced in the neurosurgery clinic on the first day and in the ED on the last day. The clinical stress level of students on the last day was higher than the first day. We found that the senior nursing students' stress levels were low on the surgical clinics and the OR. The findings showed that the clinical stress level experienced by the students at the end of their surgical clinical practices was higher than the first day. When planning the clinical placements of nursing students, planning according to the clinics they have applied before and determining the practice goals according to the clinics that students will apply for the first time can reduce the clinical stress of students.

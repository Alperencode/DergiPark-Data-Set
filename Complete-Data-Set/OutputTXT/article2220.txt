Makale Başlığı: PEG-DA/Concanavalin A Biocomposite Hydrogels Synthesis And Investigations For Cancer Therapy
Özet: Drug therapy is an important research area in cancer treatment. Conconavalin a (ConA) is a lectin used for anti-cancer drug research because it can interact with cancer cells. In this study, hydrogels was synthesized using ConA and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). Synthesized hydrogels were characterized by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and the Scanning Electron microscope (SEM). When we examined at the characterization of hydrogels, it was observed that PEGDA/ConA was integrated and that biocomposites were synthesized. Dynamic swelling behavior of synthesized hydrogels were studied at pH = 7.4 and 1.2. When we examined the swelling behavior of synthesized PEGDA/ConA hydrogels, it was observed that biocomposite hydrogels reached maximum in approximately 60 minutes. PEGDA/ConA hydrogels were loaded gentamisin, a broad spectrum antibiotic,and drug release behavior of gentamicin loaded hydrogels at pH=7.4 and pH=1.2 were investigated and compared. Considering the drug release behavior of PEGDA/ConA biocomposite hydrogels at pH=1,2, it was observed that the drug release was around 15-20% in 400 minutes, and that the drug release was around 60% in 400 minutes at pH=7,4. It has been found that its design is suitable as a drug delivery system that can be used in long-term release studies. Thus, it has been seen that PEGDA/ConA hydrogels can be used in anti-cancer drug release.

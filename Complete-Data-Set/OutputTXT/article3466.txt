Makale Başlığı: Effectiveness of melatonin in preventing vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity: an experimental study
Özet: Purpose: The aim of the study explores probable toxic effects of vancomycin on kidney and analysis of the probable protective effects of melatonin.Materials and Methods: In this study, rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group; the melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) group; the vancomycin-treated (200 mg/kg) group; and the vancomycin (200 mg/kg) + melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) group. Rats in the treatment group were given two doses of vancomycin a day with an interval of seven consecutive days and melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) once daily for seven consecutive days. The experiment was continued for 15 days. In each group, seven rats were grouped together. 15 days after the experiment, the rats were sacrificed under anesthesia and among all groups. Kidney tissues were collected and processed for further TNF- expression analysis, as well as histological analyses such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson's tricrom, and Periodic acid schiff (PAS) staining to assess pathological severity. In addition, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to evaluate apoptosis.Results: While vancomycin upregulated TNF-α expression, melatonin reduced levels of TNF-α immunoreactivity intensity and clearly improved pathological severity in rat kidneys. Further, melatonin significantly inhibited vancomycin-induced TUNEL-positive cell numbers. Conclusion: Melatonin has protective activity against vancomycin-induced pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects in kidneys during organ preservation time and improves kidney function.

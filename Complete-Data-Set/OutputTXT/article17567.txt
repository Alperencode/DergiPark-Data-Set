Makale Başlığı: PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW
Özet: European political thought in the 15th and 16th centuries sought to establish an absolute, permanent and indivisible sovereign power. In the following centuries, discussions began on how this sovereign power could be limited. Natural rights theory and the principle of separation of powers were presented as the two most effective solutions proposed for the limitation of sovereign power in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since the 19th century, we see that the principle called the rule of law has come to the fore in the debates on the limitation of power. Though, the adventure of this principle in England is older: As an idea, it was effective in the 17th century, and in the 18th century it was completely settled in the British state system. Adoption of the rule of law principle in continental European countries will remain in the 19th and 20th centuries. Although it is included in the constitutions of many states and is approved as a political ideal, opinions differ significantly on the content of the rule of law principle. In this article, the birth of the rule of law, its importance in the modern state, its criticism, and its development in Turkey as a constitutional principle will be examined.

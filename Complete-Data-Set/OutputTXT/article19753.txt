Makale Başlığı: Inscribing African American Women into the National Narrative: Lucille Clifton’s Generations as a Work of Life Writing Within the Black Arts Movement
Özet: Lucille Clifton (1936-2010) was a key figure of the Black ArtsMovement of the 1960s and 1970s. By dedicating her poems to her bodyparts and her personal experiences at different stages of her life, she hasnot only brought her African American attributes from the margins, butalso used her private female body to make political claims, sheddinglight on the points where racial and gendered experiences overlap andintersect. However, while her poetry has been celebrated and studied,her autobiography, which is a unique example of life writing withinthe Black Arts Movement, has been overlooked. This article aims totake a close look at Generations (1976) to understand how life writingcould be a platform upon which Black Arts Movement and feministwriting can intersect to reveal that the rediscovery of African Americanwomen’s histories is crucial to the goal of locating African Americancommunity in a historical chain.

Makale Başlığı: 19th Century Diwan Poet Hayri and His Poems
Özet: Among diwans there are ones which are arranged/analysed by the poet himself and also those which are compiled by someone else after the decease of poets. Information about poets whose poems could not be compiled for any reason could be attained thanks to periodicals which serve as the literary and cultural database of the period. There are periodicals which are released systemically and also those which have no regularity. Within these periodicals, we can add new information about a poet with poetry samples to the existing restricted ones in literary sources. Periodicals are important for detecting the identity of the poet by comparing his poems included in other periodicals/resources. Also, these records provide us with valuable information for detecting the relation of poet’s era with his previous and following period. A periodical which sets an example for these evaluations is recorded in 22 Sel 2299 at Edirne Selimiye Manuscript Library. On this periodical, the poems of Hayri who is one of 19th century poets have been detected and with reference to these poems, evaluations on the poems of the poet have been carried out.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluating the Clinical Leadership Levels of Nurse Managers
Özet: Objective: This study aims to determine the clinical leadership levels of nurse managers and related factorsMethods: This descriptive study was conducted on 109 nurse managers working at six hospitals – including four public hospitals, one private hospital, and one university hospital. The data was collected using Clinical Leadership Scale (CLS) including their personal and demographic information, as well as their clinical leadership traits.Results: The participants had a total mean score of 2.72±0.19 on clinical leadership scale. The mean scores of the improving services subscale were higher in female nurse managers than those of male counterparts. Participants who formally studied on management earned higher mean scores for the overall CLS and its setting direction subscale than those who did not. Likewise, the participants who formally studied on leadership earned higher mean scores for the overall CLS and its personal qualities subscale than those who did not. These findings were statistically significant (p<0.05).Conclusion: Nurse managers, especially those who formally studied on management and leadership, had high levels of clinical leadership.

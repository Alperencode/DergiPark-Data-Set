For this purpose the measurements of noise, lighting, dust, relative humidity and air velocity were made. The recommendations were made according to actual results compared with the standards. Measurements of noise and lighting were made in front of all the machinery and designated points in the factory layout plan. A noise map was drawn according to the results and recommendations were made for the points exceeding the standard noise values. For insufficiently illuminated areas, special lighting equipment was recommended. The dust measurements were made in front of dust producing machinery and the values were compared with Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAK) values. The air velocity was measured at the centre of the factory and recommendations were made for special areas that needed ventilation. Moreover, the necessity of the education of employees about the chemicals used and personal safety equipment was stated.

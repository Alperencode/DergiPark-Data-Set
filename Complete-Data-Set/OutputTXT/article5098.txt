Makale Başlığı: Digital Tendencies in Journalism Education: Comparison of Undergraduate Journalism Education in Turkey Between Universities
Özet: Developments in information and communication technologies necessitate the renewal of academic education practices and theories  in journalism education. For this reason, it is not enough for journalism in the 21st century to consist of people with sociological thinking power, professional ethics and a strong theoretical background. In addition to all these qualities, journalism needs digital literate people who can understand the language of the age, meet their needs, and know technical knowledge and programs. In this study, it is aimed to determine whether journalism undergraduate curricula in Turkey are adapted to digitalization. A total of 39 universities, 33 of which are state and 6 of which are foundations, with undergraduate programs named ‘journalism’ and ‘press and broadcasting’ in Turkey through Yök Atlas were included in the research. Courses were scanned by document analysis on the Course Information Packages of the universities. It has been concluded that the curricula of universities have adapted to digitalization, especially in the field of new media, but that adequate digitalization has not been achieved in data journalism, artificial intelligence/robot journalism.

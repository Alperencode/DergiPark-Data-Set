Makale Başlığı: Cost-Effectiveness research according to the type of catheter in the group of patients on routine hemodialysis program with permanent tunneled or temporary hemodialysis catheters
Özet: AbstractBackground: In this study, our aim was to conduct a cost/effectiveness research by determining the cost , in the patients who are in the routine hemodialysis program with a hemodialysis catheter, according to type of the catheter and  the number of the days in which the catheters can be used actively.Methods:Between 2013 and 2020,patients with temporary hemodialysis catheters (Group 1 , n:81) and patients tunneled hemodialysis catheters (Group 2, n:205) were identified by scanning the hospital archive. The number of days in which the catheters were actively used was calculated according to the next catheter insertion or replacement date. Then, the permanent and temporary catheter fees paid by the governmentdetermined, according to the current Health Practices Communique (SUT) pricing that learnt from the hospital accounting department. Catheter cost per day was determined using the SPSS 22 program.Results:In the analysis made according to demographic characteristics, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of gender (p=0.129). When the mean age of the patients was examined, no difference was found between the groups (p=0.085). No statistical difference was found between the groups in comorbid conditions: diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (p=0.219, p=0.129, p=0.822). The patency period was significantly higher in group 2 (p<0.001). It was observed that the femoral (p<0.001) region was preferred most for Group 1 patients and the jugular region (p<0.001) for Group 2 patients as the placement site of the catheters. When the catheter cost per unit day was calculated, it was understood that Group 1 was significantly less costly (p=0.031).Conclusion:Temporary hemodialysis catheters are cost/effective products compared to permanent tunneled catheters.Keywords:Hemodialysis catheter cost/effectiveness,Temporary hemodialysis catheter, Permanent tunneled hemodialysis catheter,Femoral vein, Jugular vein

Makale Başlığı: Temporal variation of air pollution variables in different regions of Turkey during the Covid-19 restrictions
Özet: The main source of air pollution is harmful gases and particulate matter released into the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels. The emergence of the new coronavirus has caused a pandemic respiratory disease (COVID-19) in which vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment are unavailable. For this reason, the concentration levels of PM10 and SO2 measured with the help of data from 78 measurement stations in Turkey, primarily in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir, were evaluated within the scope of the “National Air Quality Monitoring Network”. According to the average values calculated depending on some measures taken during the quarantine period, there has been a significant decrease in air pollutant concentrations such as PM10 and SO2, albeit in a short time. Depending on the population density of the 78 provinces represented, the ratio of the population in the regions positively affected by the decrease in PM10 and SO2 parameters to the population of Turkey is 87.6% and 70.2%, respectively. The rates for the regions negatively affected by the concentration increase were calculated as 11.8% and 29.8% for both pollutants.

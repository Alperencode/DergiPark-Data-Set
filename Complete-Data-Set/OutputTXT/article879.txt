Makale Başlığı: Effect of Inspiratory Muscle Training With the Device on Respiratory Functions
Özet: qImprovements in lung functions and respiratory muscle strength can provide better physical performance and a healthy life. The functions of the respiratory system depend on the capacity of the inspiratory muscles. Inspiratory muscle training can increase respiratory capacity by strengthening the inspiratory muscles. In the light of this information, researches on the inspiratory muscle training have increased in recently. In this study, it is aimed to examine the chronic effect of 4-week inspiratory muscle training with the device (IMT-D) on respiratory functions.  Twenty volunteers between the ages of 20-40 participate in the study IMT-D is applied to the participants every day for 4 weeks, with 40% of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values and 30 repetitions in the morning and the evening. The respiratory functions of the participants (FVC, FEV1, PEF, FEV1/FVC) is determined by spirometry at the beginning of the study, at the end of the 2nd week and at the end of the 4th week. In repeated measurements, Friedman Test is used to determine the differences between the measurements. As results, it is determined that IMT-D provided statistically significant improvement in all respiratory parameters, it is determined that the highest improvement in all parameters is in the last measurements (p<0.05).  Since it is determined that IMT-D are an important factor in improving respiratory functions, it can be recommended that people use these exercises to increase their quality of life and to protect/improve their health.

Makale Başlığı: Cost analysis in peanut bagging (human labor & prototype bagging machine)
Özet: Aims: The aim of this study was to economically compare the method that could semi-mechanized bagging and the method that uses human labor.Methods and Results: For this reason, a Prototype Pneumatic Peanut Bagging Machine powered by tractor PTO shaft was designed, manufactured and used, which conveys peanut pods from the ground using aspirated air and fill the product into the bags. As a result of the cost analysis made within the scope of the study, the cost of bagging using human labor costs 7.2 $ t-1, and the prototype bagging machine costs 9.6 $ t-1. It was determined that an average of 2.5% loss occurs due to crushing while the bags were filled with human labor. In a day of work, 15 tons of products were generally bagged and loaded on a truck. In this case, approximately 375 kg of product was lost. The shelled peanut price was approximately 1.6 $ kg-1 in 2019. The approximate monetary value of the 375 kg lost product was $600. This loss should be taken into account when evaluating both bagging methods in terms of costs.Conclusions: It has been found that bagging with a prototype machine is more profitable and more humane in terms of conditions than bagging using human labor.Significance and Impact of the Study: In terms of mechanization in the cultivation and harvesting of peanuts was no problem but some post-harvest processes (especially bagging) still require a large amount of human labor and has such as some basic problems with peanut bagging. Due to lean working and dusty environment, there was a difficult and tiring working situation in terms of occupational health. Thus was getting more and more difficult to find workers for this heavy work conditions. In addition, the shovel or canister used in bagging breaks the peanut shells and causes losses.

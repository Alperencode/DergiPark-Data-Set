This motif, whose meaning changes according to the structure or surface on which it is embroidered, has a wide range of meanings such as a divine symbol, birth-death, the light of God, prophets, heaven, the universe and worship. The motif, which is mostly respected in folk culture, is in religious buildings such as mosques, tombs and lodges; it has been applied in civil structures such as man-sions and residences and also in tombstones. The motif, which is usually made as a pencil work on plaster, on the walls of religious and civil architectural structures; it has also been applied on different surfaces such as wood, tile, ceramic, marble, stone, metal, glass and woven. One of the places where the oil lamp motif is used is the Uşak Boduroğ-lu Mosque. The oil lamp motif on the dome appears as the only example used in mosques in Uşak.

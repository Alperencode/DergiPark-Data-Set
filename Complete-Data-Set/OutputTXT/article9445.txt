Makale Başlığı: Improvement of Machining Vibrational Stabilization for a CNC Lathe in Turning of 420 Hardened Steels by MQL and Cryogenic Method
Özet: It is common to find annealed and tempered stainless steels on the market for raw materials. The choice of proper heat treatment settings is one of the most influential aspects in determining the corrosion resistance of annealed materials. The degradation of materials as a result of wear and corrosion is a problem that leads to very considerable economic losses nowadays. By applying lubrication and cooling to the material's surface during operation, the destructive effects of wear and corrosion on the material may be reduced. This study investigates the influence that different machining and lubrication/cooling environments have on vibrational stabilization-based acceleration as well as power consumption during the turning of AISI 420 stainless steel under dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), and cryogenic settings. In all of the turning trials, the cutting speed and the depth of cut were maintained at the same levels. When the data were analyzed, a change from the dry environment to the MQL condition resulted in a drop of 7.04% and 5.2% in power consumption and acceleration, respectively, while a change from the MQL test settings to cryogenic cooling conditions resulted in a decrease of 2.02% and 14.3% in power consumption and acceleration, respectively.

Makale Başlığı: Nakş and Nakkaş in Divan Literature 1: First Era
Özet: Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, in his lifetime wrote  his teachings in a book called “Erjeng” and he ornamented  a chapter of his book with drawings describing the  universe. Since drawings in “Erjeng” are so beautiful, the  book was shown as a miracle coming from the sky and  therefore Mani was attributed to be a miniaturist. That  illustrated periodical which consists of seven inscriptions  and an illustration chapter is also known as “Nigâr”,  “Nigâristan”, “Engelyûn” or “Erteng”.  Also within the divan literature, the beauty of the lover,  her image being engraved into the lover’s heart and  creativity attribute of Allah were mentioned through  various literary arts by using the miniature (nakş), the  miniaturist (nakkaş), and other related words and terms  (musavvir, nigâr, Mani, and Erjeng). In order to determine  how these words and terms were used in divan  poetry, limiting the search in terms of the era, four poets  from XIV. and XV. centuries were selected and their  poems were analyzed. Those poets are Kadı Burhaneddin  (d. 800/1398), Şeyhî (d. later than 832/1429), Ahmed  Paşa (d. 902/1497), and Necati Beg (d. 914/1509). In this  way, it is tried to manifest in which context these words  and terms were used in these centuries when the divan  literature started to develop.

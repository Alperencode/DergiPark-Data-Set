Makale Başlığı: The Effect of GA3 Applications on Yield and Quality Properties in Oil Bearing Rosa (Rosa damascena Miller)
Özet: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of GA3 applications on yield and quality characteristics. In the study, GA3 was applied to oil rose plants at five different doses (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 ppm) when budding and pink petals began to appear on sepals and one week after this date. Flowers were picked at the beginning of flowering (1-7 days), middle (8-14 days) and at the end of the (15-21 days) flowering season. Flower diameter, petal ratio, 100-flower weight and flower and essential oil yield increased up to 50 ppm GA3 dose in plants. But number of components in the essential oil increased up to 25 ppm doses, and started to decrease at the consequent GA3 doses. Geraniol decreased from 36.69% to 21.16% from the control to 100 ppm at the beginning of flowering, from 27.34% to 12.93% in the mid-flowering, and from 22.33% to 21.14% at the end of flowering. Nonadecene and nonadecane at the beginning of flowering increased from 1.44% to 2.47% and 16.50% to 23.58%, respectively, from control to 100 ppm dose, from 1.69% to 2.66 and from 17.15% to 21.23% in mid-flowering. At the end of flowering, nonadecene decreased from 2.56% to 1.87%, while nonadecene increased from 20.66% to 29.45%. Finally; it could be recommended to apply 25 ppm GA3 to obtain high flower and essential oil yield and its components in oil bearing.

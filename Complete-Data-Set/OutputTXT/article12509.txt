Makale Başlığı: Validity and reliability study of the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S) in the context of organization
Özet: This research aims to ensure the validity and reliability of the measurement tool named “Short Grit Scale” in the context of the organization. The sample of the research consists of 174 bluecollar employees working in a textile company in the province of Tokat. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to the data to test the measurement model, and the scale consistent with the data collected in accordance with its original form (eight expressions, two dimensions) has shown (x2/sd=1.49, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.53, comparative fit index (CFI) =.98, standardized root mean square residuals (SRMR) =.04). Convergent and discriminant validity were examined for construct validity. At this point, since the AVE values are calculated as .60 and .61, convergent validity was ensured; since the MSV values (.002 for both dimensions) were lower than the AVE values and the √AVE values (.77 and .78) were higher than the correlation between the factors (r =.06), discriminant validity was ensured. The positive correlation (r =.20, p < .001), which was initially predicted and determined as a result of the analysis, between the Short Grit Scale and the Resilience Scale, indicates criterion-related validity. Cronbach’s alpha and CR coefficients calculated for internal consistency gave results between .74 and .87 for the whole scale and its sub-dimensions. Findings indicate that the scale, which has been validated on students in Turkish culture before, is a valid and reliable measurement tool in the context of the organization.

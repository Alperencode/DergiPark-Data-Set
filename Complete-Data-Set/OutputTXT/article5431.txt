Makale Başlığı: Sociological Elements in Cinuçen Tanrıkorur's Understanding of Music
Özet: We can say that music is the most incredible private of a person. We all confession to ourselves the breeze of our emotions, sometimes hard, sometimes soft, sometimes emotional and sometimes motivating. In this sense, music is sometimes a way of coming to terms with oneself and even confronting oneself. Most of the time, a feeling that cannot be explained to anyone else flow itself to the mystery of a note that explodes inside us. Just as the novel built itself on the culture of confession in the modern west, music is, in a way, the composer's confession to society. But it is also the reflection of the social stracture that manifests itself in the person. In that case, can we say that music (perhaps all fields of art) is neither the individual's nor the society, but both the individual and the society at the same time? The culture that enable us to talk about the individual and society, the historical process that creates its context, etc. Should it be spoken in the subject position? Is the music what the performer or  composer lives or wants to live? This article will try to understand and explain the sociological elements of the musical style that Tanrıkorur idealized.

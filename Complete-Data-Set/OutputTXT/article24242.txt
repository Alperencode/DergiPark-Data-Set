Makale Başlığı: Restore a 9 mm diameter osteochondral defect with gene enhanced tissue engineering followed mosaicplasty in a goat model
Özet: Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of gene enhanced tissue engineering followed mosaicplasty in a goat model expecting to find a suitable method for the clinical larger osteochondral restoration. Methods: An acute cylindrical defect 9 mm in diameter was created in the weight bearing area of the medial femoral condyle in a goat model. Thirty-six medial femoral condyles were divided into 6 groups using different proportion of gene enhanced tissue engineering and mosaicplasty to restore the defects. The specimen received gross and histology observation, which was evaluated by the histological grading scale of O'Driscoll, Keeley and Salter. Transmission electron microscope observation was also performed. Two factors analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Kewls test were used to compare the specimen. Results: The gross and histology observation revealed that each defects of six groups had different restoration. The scores of the reparative tissue of three groups were significantly higher than those in other three groups. Conclusion: Gene enhanced tissue engineering followed mosaicplasty could restore a 9 mm diameter osteochondral defects in a goat model effectively. With the reduction of covering area of the graft, the advantages of the combined gene enhanced tissue engineering method can be better reflected. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0427This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

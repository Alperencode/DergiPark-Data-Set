Makale Başlığı: Mehmet Akif Ersoy and Muhammed Ikbal's Understanding Of Dynamic Godhead and The Principle of Movement
Özet: This study focuses on the understanding of the godhead of these two thinkers who determined the religious-social problems of their period and produced solutions. In addition, the study examines the principles of movement, which were found to be very effective in terms of bringing dynamism to society. Mehmet Akif Ersoy and Muhammed İkbal, who draw attention to the fact that Allah continues to create continuously, by giving place to various Qur'anic concepts expressing the creative attribute of Allah, recommend continuous activity, study and movement as an extension of their dynamic understanding of the godhead. According to İkbal and Akif, one of the most important features that distinguish human beings from other beings is their creative ability.  What makes man valuable is also his creativity. According to Iqbal and Akif, a believing man should attach importance to continuous activity and dynamism, and should not refrain from worldly affairs. All kinds of laziness and slackness, which drag society to annihilation, are strongly criticized by both poet thinkers.

It has been observed that the performance of mosque music by mosque imams and muezzins who know the science of music and have a beautiful voice has a positive effect on the congregation, while the discontent of the congregation is noticeable in other cases. The fact that halal-haram issues are Dec between Islam and music also leads to confusion in the community.

Makale Başlığı: Self-Perception from Goethe to Nigari or Fight of Human and The Devil  (Self-Journey in Context of Monomite Theory)
Özet: Nigar-name, a work written in an Islamic framework at the same time as Faust, is similar in terms of describing the inner journey of man and his struggle against various obstacles. It is noteworthy that both works describe the evolutionary journey of man. This similarity in the narrative plane of these two works, which were written without knowing each other in the same period, reveals that human beings basically try to cope with the same problem, regardless of belief or society. This fundamental problem is, according to Jung, a product of the collective unconscious. The ways of dealing with these problems, which are the common product of humanity, formed the basis of the archetype concept. Various psychological defense mechanisms created by people against all kinds of events they encounter are explained with archetypes. In this study, the similarity of the two different works of Goethe and Nigari in the same period is examined and the role of the concept of archetype in the emergence of similar creations in different cultures is emphasized by explaining the transformation journey of human through J. Campbell's Monomite Theory. This is a study that helps us understand the fundamental fallacy of the separation of Humanity in the context of Eastern and Western culture. Two people in two different geographies, who did not know each other in the same years - a good Christian and a good Muslim; one German and one Turk - arrive at the same humane conclusion: Man's fundamental fight is with the Devil.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Hematological and Biochemical Parameters and Cardiovascular Risk Scores in Patients Applying to the Obesity Outpatient Clinic
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study was to compare hematological and biochemical parameters and cardiovascular risk scoring in patients admitted to the obesity outpatient clinic. Method: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, data of the patients who admitted to the Obesity Outpatient Clinic of Duzce University Research and Application Hospital between 2017 and 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Age, gender, smoking status, presence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and body mass index (BMI) were recorded and the cardiovascular risk of the patients was calculated by using the scoring system of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and Turkish Society of Cardiology (TSC). Results: A total of 631 participants were included in the study. The mean age was 38.9±12.1 (min=21, max=65) and 75.1% of the patients were female and 24.9% were male. It was observed that 19.2% of the patients were smokers, 4.6% had DM and 36.9% had insulin resistance. When the patients were evaluated according to the BMI scores, it was found that 3.3% of them were underweight, 7.3% were  normal weight, 22.5% were overweight and 66.9% were obese. According to TSC risk scoring system, 51.4% of the patients were in low risk, 20.5% were in medium risk and 28.1% were in high risk category. According to the ESC risk scoring system, 83.5% of the patients were in low risk, 10.9% were in medium risk and 5.5% were in high risk category. According to both risk scoring systems, there were significant differences between the risk groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, and presence of DM (p<0.001). When evaluated according to the TSC risk score, it was seen that the patients in the high-risk category had a lower platelet/lymphocyte ratio and a higher total cholesterol/HDL ratio. According to both risk scoring systems, no correlation was found between cardiovascular risk and RDW, MPV, leukocyte count, and NLR(Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio).Conclusion: Conducting a cardiovascular risk assessment for patients who admit to primary health care services for obesity counseling is important. A cardiovascular risk assessment conducted at admission may help some precautions to be taken earlier. There is a need for more studies to determine easily accessible parameters that can predict cardiovascular risk.

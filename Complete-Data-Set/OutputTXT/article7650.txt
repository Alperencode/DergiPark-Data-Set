Makale Başlığı: Nanotechnological Drug Release Systems in Oral Diseases: A Review
Özet: Nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field on the  focus of most researchescarried out in the field of health in recent years. Nanotechnological drug release systems developed with nanotechnology have gained ground in many fields of medicine and have brought about in numerous advantages. The small sizes and high surface areas of nano-scale particles provide chemically more reactive and superior electrical, magnetic, optical, biological, or mechanical properties  compared  to  their  macroscopic  or  microscopic  counterparts.  Thanks  to  their superior physicochemical and biological properties, nanotechnological drugs are involved in the  diagnosis,  prevention,  and  treatment  of  oral  diseases  such  as  dental  caries,  periodontal diseases,  peri-implantitis,  pulp,  and  periapical  lesions,  denture  stomatitis,  hyposalivation, oral  cancer,  and  oral  candidiasis.  Nanotechnological  drug  delivery  systems  have  taken  an active role in the treatment of periodontal diseases and oral cancers, for they perform a long-term   release   in   the   mouth.   This   review   study   is   aimed   to   explain   the   effects   of nanotechnological  drug  delivery  systems  in  the  treatment  of  periodontal  diseases  and  oral cancers, which will be examined under the title of oral diseases.

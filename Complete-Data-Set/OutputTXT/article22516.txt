Makale Başlığı: A RARE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC TABLE: A CASE REPORT OF DELIRIOUS MANIA
Özet: Delirious mania should be considered when symptoms of delirium such as blurred consciousness, disorientation, and fluctuating course during the day are accompanied by symptoms of mania, catatonia, and/or psychosis. The clinical presentation of delirious mania begins within hours and days and progresses rapidly. Here, the appearance of mania symptoms and the treatment process of a 65-year-old female patient while being examined in the neurology service due to confusion and disorientation after a subacute-chronic period cerebrovascular accident are discussed. With the cooperation of neurology and psychiatry branches, ECT was applied to the patient who was diagnosed with delirious mania within a few hours, and a dramatic response was observed from the first ECT. After ECT was terminated, valproic acid was started as a mood stabilizer in the patient who had no history of bipolar disorder before. The patient is still in remission in terms of bipolar disorder and continues to be followed up and treated regularly. Clinicians should be careful in this regard, as delirious mania, which is rare, is a neuropsychiatric condition and can be fatal if left untreated.

Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON MILK AND HONEY PRODUCTION IN ARDAHAN PROVINCE
Özet: Changes in the global climate are among the factors threatening the stability of the global food supply. Precipitation and temperature are important components of the agricultural sector directly affecting the production. However, factors such as temperature increases, drought and sudden weather events due to natural disasters increase the concerns in the agricultural sector. Climate is one of the most determining factors in agricultural production and productivity. Preventing the negative effects of climate change on agricultural production, increasing the adaptation of agricultural production to climate change and ensuring sustainable food security should be among the priorities of the governments. In this study, it is aimed to reveal the effects of global climate change on the agricultural sector in Ardahan province for the time period of 1995-2020. For this purpose, the relationship between milk and honey production, important in Ardahan economy, with average temperature and total precipitation was examined by linear regression analysis. According to the findings, while annual total precipitation decreased milk and honey production, average temperatures did not have a significant effect on milk and honey production.

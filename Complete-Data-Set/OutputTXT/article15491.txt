Makale Başlığı: PERFORMANCE OF SOME DIFFERENT HYBRID DENT CORN (Zea mays L. indentata S.) VARIETIES UNDER CENTRAL ANATOLIAN CONDITIONS
Özet: This study was conducted under Cumra ecological conditions between 2019 and 2020 in order to determine theperformance of some KWS hybrid corn varieties (V1; Kerbanis, V2; Kefieros, V3; Kontigos, V4; Kefrancos,V5; 2572) belonging to different maturity groups. When the results obtained in both years of the study wereevaluated together, it was seen that the highest leaf number, grain protein content, and the lowest stalk lodgingvalues were obtained from the V3 variety. The highest first ear height and thousand grain weight values wereobtained from the V2, V4, and V5 varieties. The highest ear weight and grain weight per ear values wereobtained from the V2 and V5 varieties. The highest grain ear ratio, hectoliter, and the lowest grain moisturevalues were obtained from the V1 variety. The highest plant height, number of grains per ear, tasseling stage,ear length, ear diameter, stalk lodging, and grain moisture values were obtained from the V5 variety.However, obtaining the highest stalk lodging and grain moisture values from this variety in both researchyears eliminated the other positive characteristics of this variety. The highest grain yield values were obtainedfrom the V2 variety. When the evaluation is done by taking into account the highest grain yield, lowest grainmoisture, and stalk lodging values together, it is seen that the V3 variety is of a nature that can berecommended for Cumra-Konya ecological conditions.

Makale Başlığı: Ibn Khaldun's Views on Islamic Economics
Özet: Among the scientists working on Ibn Khaldun, there are those who state that Ibn Khaldun's economic thoughts are very similar to the free market theory, and there are those who argue that these ideas are closer to the Marxist understanding than the free market theory. However, his thoughts about production, property, the birth and collapse of states, counting labor among the sources of wealth and basing everything on labor and accepting it as the essential element led researchers close to Marxism to think that he was defending their own ideas. He says that economic formations are the main factor for the formation and progress of civilizations, which have a very important position for human beings and nations. These thoughts caused Marx to be understood as an intellectual who prepared his premises. However, his economic ideas are not close to either the free market theory or the Marxian mentality, as claimed. He has the idea of Islamic economy with reference to the Qur'an-Sunnah, which has its own economic system. As a result, the predictions and determinations of Ibn Khaldun are guiding for the healthy management of today's economies.

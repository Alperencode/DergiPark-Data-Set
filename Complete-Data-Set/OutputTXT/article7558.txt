Makale Başlığı: Analysing Shipping Emissions of Turkish Ports in the Black Sea and Investigating Their Contributions to Black Sea Emissions
Özet: The Black Sea is the crossroads for many nations and the economic interests of numerous countries. The ports in the Black Sea are the most important economic activity centres where the Black Sea countries carry out their import and export activities. In this paper, shipping emissions generated from ships visiting the 10 Turkish ports located in the Black Sea were estimated and their ratio in shipping emissions in the Black Sea region was evaluated. Total emissions from ships in the studied ports were estimated as 4.949 t y-1 for NOX, 280.498 t y-1 for CO2, 2.059 t y-1 for SO2, 197 t y-1 for VOC, 260 t y-1 for PM for 2018 based on ship activity-based method. General cargo and tanker ships were responsible for 92% of the total ship-borne emissions in the region, and chemicals, bulk carrier, passenger/ro-ro cargo, and other ships such as tugs, barge, multi-purpose ships, yachts, warships follow it. Emissions produced from ships were mainly emitted at cruising mode (84%), followed by hotelling mode (15%). The environmental cost of the port emissions for each pollutant was estimated as t was estimated as 61,5 million and 6.164 per ship call. Black Sea shipping emissions were 2,5% of the total international shipping emissions and shipping emissions from Turkish ports constitute 6-7% of PM, 14% of CO2, 6-14% of SO2, and 11-20% of NOX emissions of Black Sea emissions. The Black Sea region should be declared as an emission control area/sulphur emission control area to reduce shipping emissions. This is the first study to estimate Turkish port emissions in the Black Sea.

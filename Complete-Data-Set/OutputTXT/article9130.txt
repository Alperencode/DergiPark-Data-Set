As a result of the analysis, it was observed that in recent years qualitative research has dominated in educational research, content and document analysis has gained weight in the analysis of research, different sub-leadership titles have increased in the main theme of leadership in research issues, and new topics have been included in a problem-based broad school perspective. It was concluded that teachers, school administrators, students, and documents related to school processes were treatedas the study group, and, in general, document analysis and accordingly content analysis were used in the analysis of the data. It was observed that the largest number of articles published in the journals came from North America, particularly the USA while a certain proportion of research took place in other parts of the world.

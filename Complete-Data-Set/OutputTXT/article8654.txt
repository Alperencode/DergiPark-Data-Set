Makale Başlığı: Examination of Interdisciplinary Personality Profiles in Context of Financial Behaviors
Özet: The study is based on examining the relationship between personality positions in the context of psychodynamic object relations, psychological personality types and personality traits of horoscopes and basic financial behaviors. By using Melanie Klein's paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions, Myers-Briggs' 16 personality types and personality traits defined through 12 zodiac signs, a description of people's personality profiles was made on three different grounds. Not by asking people directly, the data of the study were collected in the form of proxy reports in order to reach more objective findings and to eliminate attitudes and perceptions. Horoscopes were included in the study, so that a mnemic connotation could be made in the minds of the proxies and the contours of the characters of the persons could be made more prominent, thus making it easier to obtain direct answers to basic financial behaviors. Although the findings show complexity on three different grounds regarding personality profiles, these strikingly point out that individuals' narcissistic object relations take precedence over their own schizoid positions. Because although there is a significant difference between individuals themselves, their empathic relationships or altruism and rationality, as constructed within the framework of this study, it is understood that narcissism yields complex results. In addition, it is understood that it facilitates the detection of a significant difference in the introversion-extraversion dichotomy, which is the main distinction in Myers-Briggs personality types. Regarding horoscopes, statistically significant but logically meaningless results were obtained.

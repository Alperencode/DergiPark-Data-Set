Makale Başlığı: Investigating Relationships between Catalase, Reduced Glutathione, Malondialdehyde, Vitamin C, and Total Protein Levels in Simmental Cow’s Milk and Milk Cells
Özet: In this study, to evaluate some antioxidant parameters of Simmental dairy cow’s milk and milk cells, the catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin C (Vit C), and total protein (TP) were determined, and correlations between these parameters were revealed. The milk samples, collected from 28 clinically healthy cows from a private farm, were tested by CMT. Furthermore, CMT negative samples were included in the study. Briefly, milk cells were isolated from 15 mL of milk by centrifugation, and then they were sonicated. Milk and milk cell CAT activities, GSH, MDA, Vit C, and TP levels were determined by spectrophotometric methods. TP levels were 0.043 ± 0.008 mg in milk cell of 1 mL milk and 34.28 ± 0.656 mg/mL in milk. GSH levels were 21.19 ± 1.834 nmol/mg protein in milk cells and 25.78 ± 3.054 nmol/mL in milk. CAT activities were 0.13 ± 0.017 U/mg protein in milk cells and 2.391 ± 0.277 U/mL in milk. MDA levels were 2.27 ± 0.180 nmol/mL and Vit C levels were 68.89 ± 4.226 μg/mL in milk. As regards correlations: Milk cell GSH and milk GSH levels were negatively correlated with milk cell TP levels (p<0.01). Milk cell GSH levels were positively correlated with milk GSH levels (p<0.05). Milk Vit C levels were positively correlated with milk TP levels (p<0.01). Although it was weak, there was a positive correlation between milk CAT activities and milk Vit C levels (p=0.05). In conclusion, some biochemical parameters (CAT, GSH, MDA, Vit C, and TP) of Simmental cow’s milk and milk cells were evaluated and discussed in the present study. It is thought that udder health will be positively affected by increasing the antioxidant capacity of milk cells.

Makale Başlığı: The Cognitive Biases in E-Commerce and Effects on Consumer Decisions
Özet: Commerce has been moved to online platforms, and purchasing decisions have begun to be made online without face-to-face interaction with digitalization. The digitalization of interaction eliminates the product-specific information asymmetry between sellers and consumers in favor of consumers. On the other hand, the digital footprints left by individuals in digital environments and the internet's ability to offer personalized content independent of time and place have led to the emergence of a new type of information asymmetry. The processing of consumer data has made it possible to develop digital nudge messages and content containing cognitive biases and thus posing the risk of directing consumers to irrational consumption decisions. In this study, first of all, the product pages of e-commerce platforms were examined, and frequently used cognitive biases to direct consumers to irrational consumption were revealed. Subsequently, the frequency of consumers' decision-making under the influence of cognitive biases was determined by experiments with volunteer participants on an e-commerce page developed. In addition, the data of the participants and the rational behavior scores of the participants were obtained by questionnaire study, and the relationships between cognitive biases and personal data such as rationality score, age, gender, shopping frequency, and daily time spent on the internet were analyzed by binary logistic regression. As a result of the study, the factors affecting each cognitive bias were determined, and recommendations were made for further researches.

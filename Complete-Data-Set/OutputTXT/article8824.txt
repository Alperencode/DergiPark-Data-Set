Makale Başlığı: First steps of a little artist- an introduction book for early beginners of piano and for children in special education
Özet: First steps of a little artist" is a piano method that enables two-year-olds to make their first musical steps. But this teaching method does not aim to present child prodigies as early as possible. Rather, it is about holistic creative, cognitive, motor and emotional development through music-making by people with and without handicaps. In addition to young children, piano students with autism, cognitive impairments or mental illness have also been shown to benefit from this piano method. "First steps of a little artist" works with an intuitive, colourful notation system that explicitly encourages composing one's own works from the very beginning

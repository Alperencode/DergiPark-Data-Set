Makale Başlığı: Liver Biopsy in Chronic Hepatitis Patients: Our Single Center Experience
Özet: Aim: Liver biopsy, which is used to determine fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B, is an invasive procedure and may have complications. In this study, we planned to evaluate blinded and ultrasonography (USG)-guided liver biopsies and compare complications.Material and Method: This is a retrospective study containing the data of a total of 436 chronic hepatitis B patients who underwent liver biopsy in our hospital.Results: 150 (34.4%) of the patients included in the study were female, and the mean age was 33.3±13.1/year. Complications developed in 174 (39.9%) of the patients. Of these, 110 (51.9%) developed in patients who underwent blind biopsy, 64 (28.6%) developed in patients who underwent USG guided biopsy, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Among the major complications, bleeding developed only in 2 (0.5%) patients who underwent blind biopsy, and bile leakage in 2 (0.5%) patients who underwent blind biopsy. No major complications were observed in any of the patients who underwent USG guidance. Minor complications were also detected predominantly in patients who underwent blind biopsy.Conclusion: Liver biopsy is still a reliable method in terms of complications in the evaluation of fibrosis in patients followed up with chronic hepatitis B. Minor complications are less common in USG-guided biopsies.

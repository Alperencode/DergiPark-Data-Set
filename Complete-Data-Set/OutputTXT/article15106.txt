Makale Başlığı: Nutritional values of plant residues of bean varieties grown as second crops
Özet: Bean plant is produced for fresh, canned and dried grain. The green pods of 11 bean varieties, which were grown in Kahramanmaraş conditions as second crops, were harvested due to the cold weather in November. After the fresh pods are taken, the nutritional values of the plant residues were examined by taking into account the contribution they will make to the feed or soil. In the plant residues of bean varieties used in the research, the dry weight of plant residue, ratio of dry matter, Protein, Ca (Calcium), Mg (Magnesium), K (Potassium), P (Phosphorus), ADF (Fiber Insoluble in Acid Detergent), ADP (Protein Insoluble in Acid Detergent), NDF (Insoluble Fiber in Neutral Detergent) ratios were investigated. At the end of the research, it was noted that the average values were varies plant residues weight from 1202.5 to 217.3 kg/de, dry matter ratio from 89.54 to 88.92%, protein from 17.09 to 8.49%, Ca from 1.91 to 1.42%, Mg from 0.67 to 0.51%, K from 1.23 to 0.55%, P from 0.30 to 0.21%, ADF from 76.70 to 38.03%, ADP from 1.46 to 0.9%, NDF from 66.74 to 46.39%. It was thought that it would be a very good pre-plant for the plant to be planted in winter, as it provides organic matter to the soil and fixes nitrogen to the soil with the help of nodosity formed in the plant roots. In addition to being used as fodder.

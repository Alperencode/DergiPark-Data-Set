Özet: In the world, as a result of the effects of global warming and climate change, arable land is being destroyed and is gradually decreasing. Because of this, there are serious problems with the food supply in some coastal countries. It is one of the expected threats that this problem will gain a global dimension in the coming years. For this reason, floating agriculture is making progress with different application techniques in developing and developed countries. In this study, these application techniques are expressed as traditional and modern floating agriculture and floating agriculture examples of countries are examined. In this respect, smart floating farms, where agricultural and animal production are carried out together and which have a cyclical structure within themselves, are important for sustainable and ecological production.In our country, it is necessary to advance these future-oriented applications and to increase the studies. For this reason, in the study, different floating agriculture applications are mentioned and the necessity of it is emphasized. As a result of these examined examples, the concept of outdoor and indoor space floating agriculture is opened to discussion.

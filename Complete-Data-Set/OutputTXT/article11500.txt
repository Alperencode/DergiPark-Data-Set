Makale Başlığı: Effects of hemoglobin and albumin levels on the development of pressure ulcers in inpatients in intensive care clinics
Özet: Pressure sores are accepted as an indicator of inadequate care all over the world. It also prolongs the length of hospital stay and increases the rates of mortality and morbidity. In our study, the effects of hemoglobin and albumen values on the development of pressure ulcers were investigated. The sample of the descriptive study consisted of 68 adults over the age of 18 who were hospitalized in intensive care clinics between November 2021 and March 2022. The mean age of the patients included in the study was 67.08±14.35 years. Of them, 42.6% were women, 17.6% were intubated, and 57.4% had the normal state of consciousness. The rate of pressure ulcer development in patients was 26.5%. In our study, it was determined that hemoglobin and albumin values in patients with pressure ulcers hospitalized in intensive care clinics were lower than those without pressure ulcers, and the difference was statistically significant.

Makale Başlığı: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DEFENSE REALISM, COLD WAR GERMAN-ISRAEL RELATIONS AND COOPERATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
Özet: The rivalry between USA and the Soviet Union during the Cold War also affected the intelligence wars. In this context, Germany has been the geography where the intelligence activities of the two countries took place most frequently. The rising Soviet threat, especially in the eastern region of Germany, made West German intelligence more important. The Federal Intelligence Service, the intelligence agency of West Germany, sought to cooperate with the intelligence agencies of other countries against the rising Soviet threat in this period. For this reason, the Federal Intelligence Agency turned its direction to the Israeli intelligence service. Therefore, in this study, the cooperation between the German intelligence service and the Israeli intelligence service is examined from the perspective of Defensive Realism. The basic assumption of the study is that although the international system is anarchic, as predicted by the Defensive Realist theory, states sometimes feel more secure by collaborating. Therefore, Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany also cooperated between the intelligence services in the context of the Soviet danger, Arab-Israeli wars, and the fight against terrorism during the Cold War period, and both states felt more secure in the international system. There are not enough resources on this subject in the literature. This study sheds light on the cooperation activities of BND and MOSSAD intelligence agencies during the Cold War period.

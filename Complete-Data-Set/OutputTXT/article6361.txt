Makale Başlığı: A Bull Statue with Hieroglyphic Luwian Inscription (MARAŞ 16) in Kahramanmaraş Museum and the Chronology of the Late Hittite Kingdom of Gurgum
Özet: In this article, an edition of an unpublished inscription (MARAŞ 16) on a basalt bull statue of the 8thcentury BCE from Maraş is presented. Unlike the two rulers by the name of Larama known in Gurgumhistory, the author of the inscription is a third Larama, son of Hunita. The implications of this newdatum for the chronology of the Gurgum dynasty are briefly discussed as well.

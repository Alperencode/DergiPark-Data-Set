Makale Başlığı: Feminism, Historical Origins Of Feminism And Basic Concepts
Özet: Since the 18th century, women have begun to question their disadvantaged position in society because of the inequalities they face. Experiencing inequalities in legal, political, economic, administrative, social and cultural areas caused them to question their positions and thus to start a struggle. When we look at the origin of the word feminism, we encounter the word "femine", which means woman in Latin. Historically, feminism first appeared in England in the 18th century. Feminism opposes the inequality that exists between men and women, and advocates social, cultural, political and economic equality between men and women. Feminism, whose main purpose is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of women, strives for women to have equal rights with men. Feminism involves women making politics in their struggle for their fundamental rights and freedoms. The movement of feminism, which was initiated by women to be equal with men in the private and public sphere, to be free and to get rid of social pressure, has undergone a change in meaning in different times and situations in the historical process, experienced with changes and transformations in terms of conceptual and political activism. Feminism in general claims that women should be equal to men and aims to destroy masculine oppression against women. In this study, feminism is discussed within the framework of its historical origin and basic concepts.

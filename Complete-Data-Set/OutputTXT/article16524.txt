Makale Başlığı: History of Mustafa Naîmȃ Efendi in the Context of Tȃrih-i Naȋmȃ
Özet: History is a branch of science that examines the events in the past, and historiography is the transfer of the events that happened in the past to future generations by writing them down through historians. Although the Ottoman Empire's understanding of historiography was built on the legacy of the Turkish-Islamic states before it, over time it took on a unique structure. In this context, in the later periods of the state, historiography activities gained importance and emerged as an official state duty under the name of chronicler. Mustafa Naȋmâ Efendi, who is the subject of our study; He is one of the famous chroniclers who was born in 1655 in Aleppo and lived in the 17th century Ottoman period. He is distinguished from other Ottoman historiographers in many ways in Ottoman historiography with his work called Ravzatü’l-Hüseyn fȋ hulâsati ahbari’l-hâfikayn, which he wrote as the first chronicler. In this respect, the author and his work have been widely used in every period. In this study, we will try to evaluate Mustafa Naȋmâ Efendi's life, his work, historiography in the context of his work, and the innovations he brought to the field of history from a contemporary perspective.

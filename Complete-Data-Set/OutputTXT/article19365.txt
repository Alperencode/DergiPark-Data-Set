Makale Başlığı: Identifying the presence of context and item-writing flaws in practice items: The case of Turkish mathematics textbooks
Özet: This study seeks to ascertain the degree to which context-based items are offered in Turkish mathematics textbooks as well as the quality of the items in terms of item writing guidelines, whether or not they are given as traditional or context-based. A qualitative research approach is used in this study. The eighth-grade mathematics textbook used in public schools and a textbook used in certain private school chains constitute its sample. The practice items (i.e, exercises without solutions given) included in the textbooks were analyzed by performing document analysis. The results revealed that both textbooks contain several flawed items in terms of item writing rules, as well as having mainly non-contextual items.

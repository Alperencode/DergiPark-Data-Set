Makale Başlığı: A Suggestion and Evaluation of a STEM Activity about Friction Coefficient for Pre-Service Science Teachers
Özet: In this study, the process of developing and evaluating a STEM activity which can be implemented during Science Teaching Laboratory Practice course in accordance with the 5E Model related to the concept of friction coefficient was addressed. The implementation of the activity was conducted in the form of a case study with the participation of 16 third year pre-service science teachers. Student journal forms and worksheets were utilized for the evaluation of the activity. As a result, it was determined that planned activity could be successfully applied to the pre-service teachers during the weekly course hours of Science Teaching Laboratory Practice course. In addition, positive feedbacks were obtained from pre-service teachers’ evaluation for the activity. It is believed that such studies, which establish connections between science and different disciplines, can contribute to the training of qualified science teachers and that such studies should be given more space in science teacher education.

Makale Başlığı: IMMUNOMODULATORY POTENTIAL OF CLAUSENA EXCAVATA LEAVES FRACTIONS VIA DECREASING THE PRODUCTION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES FROM IMMUNE CELLS
Özet: Objective: Clausena excavata is known to possess anti-oxidant property. However, this property through which mechanism it affects the immune cells and suppresses the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has not been explored.         Material and Method: This study evaluated the immunomodulatory activities of ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, chloroform, and methanol C. excavata leaf extracts by decreasing the production of ROS from whole blood, polymorphonuclears (PMNs) cells and macrophages.         Result and Discussion: Among the fractions tested, ethyl acetate C. excavate extract (EACE) showed potent anti-oxidant property and significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed intracellular and extracellular phagocytic oxidative ROS burst produced by the zymosan and PMA-activated whole blood, PMNs, and macrophages cells with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5.7 ± 0.01, 1.3 ± 0.01, and 0.7 ± 0.03 µg/mL respectively. This study provides information regarding the mechanism behind its anti-oxidant property and its herbal use in treating various higher oxidative stress associated diseases.

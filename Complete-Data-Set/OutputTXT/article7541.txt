Makale Başlığı: Using multiple linear regression to analyze changes in forest area: the case study of Akdeniz Region
Özet: Forest area losses are one of the most significant changes in land cover. These losses negatively affect ecosystems and cause severe economic and social life problems. It is necessary to monitor the process carefully and analyze the effects well to minimize all these negative effects in forest land losses and improve the development in urban areas positively. It is of great importance that these analyses are carried out quickly and accurately in terms of developing the natural environment. In this study, the effects that cause forest losses in the Mediterranean Region over the years are examined with the data obtained with the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Within the scope of the study, the changes in forest areas in the Mediterranean Region between 2004 and 2019 have been examined by considering many factors. In the study, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, temperature, land surface temperature, aerosol optical depth, ozone, fire, urban areas, and population data were obtained with GEE. The data obtained were analyzed statistically, and the factors affecting the losses in forest areas the most were determined.

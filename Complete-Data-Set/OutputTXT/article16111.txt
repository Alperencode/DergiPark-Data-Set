Makale Başlığı: Missing Children Of Migrations And Their Rights Deprivation
Özet: We live in a time that is associated with negative emotions such as fear, anxiety and worry. Forced migrations are a time of crisis when the above-mentioned negative emotions become the dominant emotions of daily life for the people who were forced to migrate. Among the main reasons that create the migration mobility, to which Eastern societies geographically and mostly Muslim masses are exposed, the economic-based problems such as poverty, hunger and unemployment, which affect large masses, are at the forefront, along with political problems such as social internal turmoil, terrorism and wars. It is also a fact that the main victims of migration, one of the deep-rooted problems of human history, are disadvantaged groups of people such as women, children and the elderly. Migration, as a phenomenon that threatens the basic social structure that has value for the individual and society, such as family, where the ordinary flow of life is interrupted, points to an insecure and dangerous process especially for children. Losing one or both of their parents, even though family integrity is preserved, children who have to travel thousands of kilometers illegally and overcoming difficult geographical obstacles for reasons such as life safety cannot always achieve the security and peace they aim for. In a world where the problems that create the basis for migration do not slow down, Turkey, as a key country on the migration route, has received general appreciation for its approach that prioritizes humanitarian and religious values against the migration waves caused by the Syrian and Afghani crises. In the context of immigration policies, it is important to protect children from the emotional traumas caused by migration, to ensure their safety, education and employment. In this research, the negative effects of migration on children are subjected to content analysis through concepts in the literature such as 	“child abandonment”, “misopedia”.

Makale Başlığı: Corporate Social Responsibility Practices as a Tool of Organizational Legitimacy: The Case of Koza Mining
Özet: Our aim in this study is to evaluate the corporate social responsibility practices of Koza Mining Operations from the perspective of institutional mechanisms, and to reveal the society-based nature, which was inadequate in previous studies that explain the concept in particular.In particular, the fact that the institutional environment is subject to insufficient scrutiny by researchers and the studies conducted so far mainly on the place of responsibility practices related to financial performance have caused the concept to be subject to limited research in the literature. The study was carried out through in-depth interviews and archive scans with company officials in three mining sites (Bergama, Balıkesir and Gümüşhane) where the highest number of administrative lawsuits were filed against Koza Mining Operations. The case study method was chosen among the qualitative research methods in the study.  According to the findings obtained from the study, it was determined that the company uses its corporate social responsibility practices as a public relations policy to solve or eliminate local or national problems (corporate legitimacy crisis) in the region.

Makale Başlığı: Political History of Gorgan until the Domination of the Ziyâri Dynasty
Özet: The city of Gorgan has an important place in Islamic History and Civilization. Located in the south-east of the Caspian Sea, Gorgan has always been a center of attraction due to its geopolitical position, its port, fertile wetlands and being on the silk road route. Although it is not clear, different local dynasties ruled in the city, whose history dates back to very ancient times. For the first time, the city conquered by Muslims in the time of Umar's caliphate, but rebelliona broke out and the administration of city changed  many times. It was only possible to establish complete dominance in the city and region in the time of Suleiman b. Abdulmalik who was the caliph of Umayyads. The area became a refuge for opponents of the administration during the Abbasid era. After the Ziyarid Dynasty (928-1090) acquired the center of Gorgan, the city regained its calm and after that became a center of science, culture and art where great scholars grew up.

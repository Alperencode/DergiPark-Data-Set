Makale Başlığı: Identification of Key Genes and Pathways Associated With Pediatric Obesity
Özet: Objective: In this study, it was aimed to identify potential key genes and pathways that play a role in obesity in children diagnosed with obesity in order to investigate possible molecular mechanisms associated with childhood obesity. Materials & Methods: Expression data of pediatric obesity data with accession numbers GSE9624 and GSE139400 were selected from the GEO database for bioinformatics analysis. The GSE9624 dataset was studied with samples from 14 obese and 13 non-obese children, and the GSE139400 dataset was studied with samples of adipose tissue and blood samples from 5 obese and 5 normal-weight children.  Samples from obese children and samples from normal-weight children were analyzed by GEO2R to find differentially expressed genes (DEG). GO and KEGG enrichment analyzes were performed for DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created with the Cytoscape software and important genes associated with obesity were identified.Results: DEGs with a P-value <0.05 and log2FC≥0 or ≤0 as a result of analysis with GEO2R were selected. In the GSE9624 dataset, the expression of 1933 genes increased in the obesity group compared to the control group, while the expression of 1462 genes decreased. In the GSE139400 data set, while the expression of 725 genes increased in the obesity group compared to the control group, the expression of 1372 genes decreased. In both data sets, 89 DEGs with increased expression and 161 DEGs with decreased expression were identified. It has been observed that the genes whose expression changes are collected in Lipid and atherosclerosis, Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, mTOR signaling pathway and Parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and effect pathways. In addition, ALB, RHOA, KRAS, CREB1, GNAQ, GATA3, CXCR3, EZR, SERPINA1, GNAO1 genes were among the most important genes.Conclusion: The results of this study showed that emerging pathways and genes may have an important role in childhood obesity.

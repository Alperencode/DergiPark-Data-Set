Makale Başlığı: Retrospective evaluation of Q fever cases in Çanakkale province
Özet: Objective: Q fever is a zoonotic disease that can be misdiagnosed due to non-specific symptoms that can be seen in acute and chronic forms, especially in individuals in the risk group. These disease cases, which were frequently misdiagnosed in the past, have started to be reported in our country in recent years. In this study, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters of Q fever cases and to increase awareness of Q fever disease.Method: In our retrospective observational study, Q fever cases over 18 years of age with a definitive diagnosis were evaluated. Demographic data of the patients, such as age, gender, occupation, place of residence, tick contact history, the time period of the disease (year, season, month), accompanying comorbidities, symptoms, physical examination, laboratory findings, treatments, recovery, and mortality status of the patients examined.Results: A total of 14 cases, 7 (57%) males, with a mean age of 49.2±12.1 years were included in the study. The most common symptoms were fever (100%), cough (71.4%), and myalgia (57.1%). All of the cases were cases of acute Q fever, and endocarditis was not detected in any of the cases.Conclusion: Since our country is one of the possible endemic regions for Q fever disease, it should be kept in mind, especially in the presence of pneumonia and myalgia in patients who live in rural areas and have risk factors such as dealing with livestock and consuming unpasteurized milk and dairy products.

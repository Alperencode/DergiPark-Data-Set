Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE FATHERS’ TIME SPENDING TOGETHER WITH THEIR CHILDREN
Özet: Fathers taking a more active role in raising children have positive effects on the child's social, emotional, mental, sexual identity, and personality development. This study examined the situation of fathers whose children are between three and six years old, spending time with their children. The participants of the study consisted of 848 fathers whose children are between three and six years old. "Personal Information Form" and "The Form for Determining the Situation of Spending Time with the Child" developed by the researcher were used as data collection tools. The data were collected through the internet. Obtained data were analyzed with T-Test, Anova, and v tests. According to the findings, it was seen that socioeconomic level affects the father's spending time with the child, and fathers with high income spend more time with their children than fathers with low income. The educational level of the father also affects the level of spending time with the child. As the educational level increases, the level of the fathers’ spending time with their child increases in direct proportion. An inversely proportional relationship was found between the number of children and the time spent with the child. It was understood that fathers with fewer children spent more time with their children. In addition, older fathers spend less time with their children than younger fathers. It was concluded that the level of fathers spending time with their children did not differ significantly according to the gender of the child.

Makale Başlığı: SIMILAR FISCAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE LIGHT OF ARTICLE 73 OF THE CONSTITUTION: CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION SHARE
Özet: The Article 73 of the Constitution regulates the tax obligation as follows; Paragraph 3: "Taxes, fees, duties, and similar fiscal obligations shall be imposed, amended, or revoked by law." and Paragraph 4: "The authority can be granted to the President of the Republic to amend the percentages of exemption, exceptions, and reductions in taxes, fees, duties, and other such financial obligations, within the minimum and maximum limits described by law".  States enforce a large number of monetary obligations to cover public spendings, which are classified according to their qualifications. The study aims to investigate whether the "cultural contribution" brought to the telephone devices by the Decision of the President No. 2187 is "similar fiscal obligation" or a fee in the light of the Article 73 of the Constitution and with the help of the Constitutional Court decisions.

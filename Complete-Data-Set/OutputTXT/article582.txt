Makale Başlığı: Disadvantaged Students in the Distance Education: An Analysis  Specific to Science Lesson
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to reveal the situation of disadvantaged students in the science lesson of the COVID-19 pandemic distance education period in Turkey. For this purpose, the experiences of science and primary school teachers in distance education were examined. The research was a case study, which is one of the qualitative research methods. Participants comprised 58 science and primary school teachers. The data collected via a semi-structured interview form was subjected to content analysis. The results show that the disadvantaged groups most affected by distance education are poor students, inclusive students, students without parental care, gifted students, and immigrant students. Teachers stated that disadvantaged students have experienced deep learning losses in science, their interest in science has decreased, and multiple disadvantages have made science teaching difficult. Also, it has been concluded that in science teaching with disadvantaged students, teachers show individual attention to students, cooperate with stakeholders, and create an inclusive education environment. Another important result is that many students could not receive science education in distance education.

Makale Başlığı: AN ASSESSMENT OF THE DETENTION MEASURE IN THE CASES OF LACK OF JURISDICTION, LACK OF COMPETENCE AND DETERMINATION OF THE COMPETENT COURT
Özet: The rule of jurisdiction and competence has a significant role in criminal proceedings. Even though it is not widely applied in criminal proceedings, the indication of appropriate court is also important based on the court's intended judicial role. Only the disputed matters are evaluated by the judicial authorities in applica-tions for jurisdiction, competence, and indication of appropriate court disputes, and judicial authorities refrain from deciding on issues such as objections to the detention order, claims for release, and reviews of detention orders. Therefore, it takes a long time to come to a ruling on claims for the detention order. This situation leads to unjust treatment of individuals as well as interference with their freedom and rights, which is prohibited by the ECHR and the Constitution. Hence, the aim of “Eliminating the Vagueness and Unjust Treatment Arising from the Practice of Appealing and Juridical Review in the Event of Lack of Venue and Competence, and Indication of Appropriate Court" in the Action Plan on Human Rights (APHR) will bring a strong legal assur-ance against unlawful interference with people's freedom and rights. In addition, enacting legal measures that are consistent with our perspectives in order to avoid vagueness and unjust treatment can be a beginning for accomplishing the APHR’s aim and solving the problem.

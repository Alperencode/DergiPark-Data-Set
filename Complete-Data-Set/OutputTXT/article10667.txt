Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Teratogenic and Developmental Toxicity of Everzol Red LFB and Everzol Yellow CGL on Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Embryos
Özet: Synthetic dyes produced by chemical synthesis are used in textile, food, cosmetic, plastic, and pharmaceutical industries. Of these dyes, azo dyes are a major group of dyes widely used by these industries despite their harm to the environment. A limited number of studies have focused on the impact of dyes on the environment; thus eco-toxicological studies are imperative. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effect of Everzol Red LFB (ERL) and Everzol Yellow CGL (EYC) on zebrafish embryos. Embryos were exposed to 23-600 mg L-1 ERL and EYC for 96 hours and the survival rates, heart rate, hatching rates, and body malformation of these individuals were determined. According to the results of this study, the 96 h LC50 values of the ERL and EYC were determined to be 292 (232-391) and 127 (107-152) mg L-1, respectively. The teratogenic index (TI) values of the ERL and EYC were calculated as 1.37 and 1.49, respectively. ERL and EYC are teratogenic for zebrafish embryos based on the calculated TI value. Both dyes caused significant inhibition of embryonic growth and heart rate in Danio rerio embryos. ERL and EYC caused pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail malformation, and spinal curvature in embryos. According to the determined parameters, the negative effect of EYC on zebrafish larvae is greater than of the ERL. These results indicate that both dyes have adverse effects on zebrafish development and may adversely affect the aquatic ecosystem if they enter the aquatic environment.

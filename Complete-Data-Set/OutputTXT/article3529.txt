Makale Başlığı: Effect of Covid-19 Pandemic on Patients Undergoing Definitive Chemoradiotherapy
Özet: Lung cancer is frequently seen in patients who smoke, who are elderly, and who have more comorbid diseases. The risk of being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic is high in these patients.  Here, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of the definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with non metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) during the pandemic period. Patients with NSCLCs, between 2020-2022 were evaluated retrospectively. Treatment responses were evaluated and prognostic factors were investigated. Twenty-eight patients (70%) were men and twelve (30%) were women. Twenty-five (62.5%) patients had comorbidities. All of patients complated their treatments. Objective response rate was 72.5%. Respectively, 72.5% of patients had partial response, 27.5% of patients had stable disease. 92.5% of patients had a reduction in primary tumor, 42.5% had lymph nodes and 75% had a reduction in stage. Seven (17.5%) patients developed Covid-19. Passing a Covid-19 was decreased survival (p=0.012). In conclusion; High response rates have been obtained with CRT treatment applied to NSCLC patients during the Covid-19 pandemic period. Covid-19 infection significantly reduced survival in NSCLC patients receiving definitive CRT.

Makale Başlığı: The assessment of clinical approaches and properties of benign hindfoot tumors
Özet: INTRODUCTION: In this study we retrospectively aimed to analyze the 24 patients with the diagnosis of benign hindfoot tumor who were surgically treated.METHODS: Eighteen of the patients were male, and six were female. Sixteen of the tumors were in calcaneus and eight were in talus. Open biopsy was performed for all the patients and the surgical planning was decided according to histopathologic results.RESULTS: The most common tumor was osteochondroma. Local infection was encountered in three of the patients. No intraoperative complication was recorded. No recurrence was detected in any patients.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The most common complaint of patients with hindfoot tumors was pain and a possible bone tumor should be kept in mind and radiological interventions should be ordered for the diagnosis of the patients unresponsive to treatment. Because of its unique anatomic structure and the requirement for detailed imaging studies, talus located bone tumors can easily be skipped. Finally, biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis following radiologic interventions.

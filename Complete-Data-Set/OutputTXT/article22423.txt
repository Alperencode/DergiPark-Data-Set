Makale Başlığı: Architectural Space Readings of Emre Arolat Designs
Özet: Today's architecture maintains the coexistence of many movements, theories, ideologies and ideas with complex and pluralistic approaches. With the changes and differences in lifestyles in the physical and cultural environment, the obtained content data and expectations shape the architectural design. While every design starts with a search for ideas and insights on how to solve a problem, architects show their creativity in their designs with different answers and solution suggestions. Emre Arolat (EAA) has been one of the architects who determined the architectural agenda of the last 20 years with his designs, practices, discourses, success in competitions, and work in academic and professional organizations. Since it is thought that Emre Arolat's accepted architectural understanding thought/idea, style/language, representation, design interpretations and promotion of his works will contribute to the development and understanding of contemporary Turkish architecture, it is aimed to transfer his architectural works to the next generations by bringing them into the literature. Among the projects with different functions provided by Emre Arolat (EAA) office, 8 buildings that stand out with their unique architecture, thematic formation and spatial qualities are studied. As a result of literature review, field study, online interviews with Emre Arolat (EAA) in digital environment and by obtaining the study’s data the guiding qualities in the relationship between physical architecture and thematic formations were interpreted. Architectural space readings based on Emre Arolat's (EAA) practices and discourses have been designed to provide a different perspective on design creativity and enable the acquisition of necessary information for new designs.

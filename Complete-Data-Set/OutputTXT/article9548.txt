Makale Başlığı: A Novel Operator to Solve Decision-Making Problems Under Trapezoidal Fuzzy Multi Numbers and Its Application
Özet: This article investigates solutions to multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems in which the attribute values take the form of trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers. To do this, this paper proposes a kind of mean aggregation operator called the Bonferroni harmonic mean operator for aggregating trapezoidal fuzzy information. Then, an approach that is a solution algorithm has been developed to find a solution to multi-attribute decision-making problems. Afterwards, an illustrative example has been given to verify the developed approach and to show its usefulness and efficiency. Finally, a comparison table has been presented to compare the proposed method with some existing methods.

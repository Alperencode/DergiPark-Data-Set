Makale Başlığı: On efficient computation of equilibrium under social coalition structures
Özet: In game-theoretic settings the key notion of analysis is an equilibrium, which is a profile of agent strategies  such that no viable coalition of agents can improve upon their coalitional welfare by jointly changing their strategies. A  Nash equilibrium, where viable coalitions are only singletons, and a super strong equilibrium, where every coalition is  deemed viable, are two extreme scenarios in regard to coalition formation. A recent trend in the literature is to consider  equilibrium notions that allow for coalition formation in between these two extremes and which are suitable to model  social coalition structures that arise in various real-life settings. The recent literature considered the question on the  existence of equilibria under social coalition structures mainly in Resource Selection Games  RSGs , due to the simplicity  of this game form and its wide range of application domains. We take the question on the existence of equilibria under  social coalition structures from the perspective of computational complexity theory. We study the problem of deciding  the existence of an equilibrium in RSGs with respect to a given social coalition structure. For an arbitrary coalition  structure, we show that it is computationally intractable to decide whether an equilibrium exists even in very restricted  settings of RSGs. In certain settings where an equilibrium is guaranteed to exist we give polynomial-time algorithms to  find an equilibrium.

Makale Başlığı: ÇOLAK İBRAHİM AND THE 2ND KUVA-YI SEYYARE
Özet: Until the establishment of the regular armies in the National Struggle, the forces that occupied our country and especially the Greek invasions in Western Anatolia were fought within the structure of the Kuva-yı Milliye. The forces commanded by Circassian Ethem among the Kuva-yı Milliye groups fighting on different fronts were called Kuva-yı Seyyare. While the Circassian Ethem and Kuva-yı Seyyare forces were fighting against the invading Greeks in 1919 and 1920, they were also effective in suppressing the riots against the National Struggle.Starting from April 1920, the formation of a new force was deemed necessary, as the Kuva-yı Seyyare units and national forces were insufficient in the rebellion regions. In this context, the new force created with the encouragement and direction of Ali Fuat Pasha was called Kuva-yı Seyyare. However, in order for the Circassian Ethem to be seen separately from the Kuva-yı Planet, this force was called the 2nd Kuva-yı Seyyare. Miralay Çolak İbrahim Bey was appointed as its commander.Çolak İbrahim Bey and the 2nd Kuva-yı Seyyare units he commanded took part in suppressing the rebellions in Düzce and Yozgat. Later, in the efforts to establish a regular army, Çolak İbrahim Bey and the 2nd Kuva-yı Seyyare detachments were organized as the 3rd Cavalry Division and actively fought on the front in the Battle of İnönü, the Battle of Sakarya and the Great Offensive, respectively, and gained significant success.In this study, the formation of the 2nd Kuva-yı Seyyare is discussed by making use of archival documents, published memories and studies on the subject. Later on, the effects and efforts of the 2nd Kuva-yı Seyyare, which he commanded together with Çolak İbrahim Bey, in suppressing the rebellions were tried to be given.

Makale Başlığı: Eligibility of Disputes for Mediaton Arising from Trademark Infringement
Özet: The protection of industrial property rights requires disputes arising from these rights to be resolved in a reasonable time, with less cost and effectiveness. For this reason, mediation is an effective method for the disputes arising from the infringement of the trademark to ensure the rapid circulation of the goods and services that are subject to the trademark right, to protect the commercial reputation, and for the possibility of the emergence of irreparable damages in case of the products subject to the infringement act. However, eligibility for mediation of the disputes arising from the infringement of the trademark should be examined in the light of the nature and varieties of claims of the trademark right holder, asserting these claims together, and the non-eligibility for mediation of certain claims. In this study, the following questions are examined considering the claims the trademark right holder may assert: do the parties have the power to freely dispose of the disputes arising from the infringement of the trademark, do the disputes arising from the infringement of the trademark eligible for mediation?

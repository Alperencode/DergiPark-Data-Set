Makale Başlığı: ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY PSEUDOANEURYSM DUE TO INTERLOCKING BOLT OF TIBIAL NAIL  A CASE REPORT AND REVIEW
Özet: Vascular injuries associated with the tibial nailing have been reported in few case reports now. We here report a unique case of anterior tibial artery (ATA) pseudoaneurysm caused by the second proximal coronal interlocking bolt, only second such case in English literature. This case, along with other reports of ATA injury by interlocking bolts, highlight the need for relook at the nail design and screw hole positions to avoid such complications in future. We found that the position of interlocking bolts on the nail brings them very close to the anatomical positions of arteries in leg. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0373This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: A Prayer Phrase on the Doublures Cover of the Principalities Period Turkish-Islamic Bindings: al-‘İzz al-dā’im wa’l-iqbāl
Özet: The phrases of prayer on the Turkish-Islamic bindings of the Principalities period are among the subjects that have been studied at least. The subject of this article is the al-’İzz al-dā’im wa’l-iqbāl phrase written on the doublure cover of the Turkish-Islamic bindings produced in the Principalities period, which has not been the subject of a scientific study until now, and the pattern composition containing this phrase. al-’İzz al-dā’im wa’l-iqbāl translates as everlasting power and prosperity/high position. As a result of the research, this phrase was found on the doublure cover of six manuscripts of the Principalities period (Amasya ML: 217, İnebey ML Hüseyin Çelebi: 481 and Ulu Cami: 318, Kastamonu ML: 2856 and 3435 and Süleymaniye ML Fatih: 5004). The pat-tern of the doublure cover is a full-ground geometric design decorated with floral and rūmī motifs. This prayer phrase is written on the hexagonal sheets inside the geometric pattern. The phrase has been designed and written in two types, a single line and double line reverse symmetrical. The inscription was found on books and various objects (bowl, ewer, cup, etc.) belonging to important people in the Seljuk, Anatolian Principalities, and early Ottoman periods. It is thought that this phrase is a phrase of prayer wishing that power and high position will be permanent, and that the addressee of the prayer is the sultan, a person belonging to the sultanate or a person who took part in important levels of the state. The waqf seals and records of the individuals on the works also support this.

Asthe amount of SCT fuel (tons) – the amount of subvention (₺) - amount offishery landings (tons), respectively; It was calculated 273.098 tons -427.239.647 ₺ - 3.113.476 tons for the Black Sea, 232.951 ton - 356.733.841₺ -387.840 tons for the Marmara, 172.072 tons - 265.278.577 ₺ - 378.133 tons forthe Aegean and 152.382 tons - 228.406.677 ₺ - 211.819 tons for theMediterranean. From the entire fishery areas, the total amount of 830,503 tonsfuel was consumed for a total of 4,091,268 tons of fishery landings. Theaverage quantity of fishery landing obtained per liter of fuel was calculated9.58 kg for the Black Sea, 1.40 kg for the Marmara, 1.85 kg for the Aegean and1.17 kg for the Mediterranean. Comparing the kg fishing landing obtained perliter of the fishing areas by year, it was found that there was a significantdifference (P <0.05) between the areas in all years except for the year of2016. This difference was due to the fact that the amount of product obtainedin the Black Sea was considerably higher than the other areas. In the ten yearsperiod, the monetary value of the fishing landings from all of Turkey’s exclusiveeconomic zone was calculated to be 10.560.952.248₺

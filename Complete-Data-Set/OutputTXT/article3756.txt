Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Irrigation Types on Distribution and Population Densities of Citrus Nematode [Tylenchulus semipenetrans (Cobb, 1913) (Tylenchida: Tylenchulidae)] in Citrus Orchards in Adana and Mersin Provinces
Özet: Determination of distribution and population density of citrus nematode, Tylenchulus semipenetrans Cobb (1913) (Tylenchida: Tylenchulidae) is essential for effective control. In this study, 42 different soil and root samples were taken from citrus orchards of different ages in Adana (Yüreğir) and Mersin (Yenice) provinces, where flood irrigation and drip irrigation were applied. The samples were collected from the orchards twice in 2015, in March-April and September-October. Tylenchulus semipenetrans was detected in 100%, 88.8%, 85.7% 75%, 66.6% of the surveyed orchards. Citrus nematode was found in all the samples taken from these orchards. The population density was found to be lower in newly established or early age and drip irrigation orchards. It has been observed that the nematode is above the economic damage threshold and tolerates it in mature orchards.

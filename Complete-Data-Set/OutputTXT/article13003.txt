Makale Başlığı: TATEMAE IN JAPANESE CULTURE AND ITS APPERANCES IN LANGUAGE -A CORPUS ANALYSIS ON THE WORD KONDO-
Özet: In this study, the concept of tatemae which is one of the Japanese cultural elements and has an important role in communication is examined. It is aimed to describe the characteristics of tatemae and how it is represented in the Japanese language. In accordance with this purpose, the previous studies are examined. With the tatemae samples in previous studies, the similar expressions in Japanese workbooks with dialogue are defined as the expressions with tendency of tatemae. In these expressions, it is revealed that the word kondo has the highest frequency in both BCCWJ (Balanced Corpus of Written Japanese Language) and CEJC (Corpus of Everyday Japanese Conversation). Because of the high frequency and both the tendency of tatemae and the general use of kondo, it is examined in detail in CEJC. According to this examination, regardless of whether it is tatemae or not, kondo is mostly used in family in the context of human relations and in dining-meeting in the context of occasion.

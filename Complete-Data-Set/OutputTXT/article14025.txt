Makale Başlığı: All-Solid-State Composite Lead (II)-Selective Potentiometric Electrode Based on Clay
Özet: The bentonite clay was characterized by XRD, FTIR and SEM-EDX techniques. The characterized bentonite clay was used as an ionophore material in the production of solid state composite potentiometric electrodes and its potentiometric electrode application was carried out. It was observed that the electrode exhibited a highly sensitive and selective potentiometric response to Pb2+ ion compared to other common inorganic cations. Membrane optimization studies indicated that the composition exhibiting the best potentiometric performance properties was 65.0% graphite, 5.0% multi-walled carbon nanotube, 20.0% ionophore (bentonite) and 10.0% paraffin oil by mass. It was also observed that the Pb2+ selective composite electrode exhibited a linear response in the concentration range of 1.0×10-5 ˗ 1.0×10-1 M with an average potential difference of 31 mV for each 10-fold Pb2+concentration change in the linear operating range. The detection limit of the electrode was calculated as 9.0×10-6 M. It was also revealed that the response time of the electrode was quite short (~5 s) and the reproducibility of the potentiometric response was quite high.

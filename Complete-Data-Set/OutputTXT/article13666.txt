Makale Başlığı: PSYCHEDELIC APPROACHES OFFERING USER EXPERIENCE IN DIGITAL DESIGN
Özet: Do web pages that offer user experience really affect the user’s desire for spiritual andpsychological development? Web pages like hallucinogens that allow the mind and soul to manifest cando this. Psychedelic art is the catalyst for digital design, just as dreams fuel the imagination. Digital designis inspired by psychedelic art to alter the linear continuity of consciousness. While using the possibilitiesof technology, design also makes use of the psychedelic connotations of art. Common visual elements ofwebsites that offer user experience; spiral patterns, bright colors, modern flowing typographic elementsand detailed fantastic subjects. Visual hallucinations presented to the users of these pages are like a “digitalpsychedelic drug” that targets complex emotions. In this direction, firstly, the basic structure of consciousnessand mind and the effects of psychedelics were discussed in the research. Second, the features of psychedelicart developed with the use of psychedelics and its effects on design are emphasized. Finally, the designfeatures of web pages that change the state of mind and create and virtual reality are examined. Thisstudy, which includes three different website reviews providing user experience, discusses the psychedelicexperiential aspect of web pages used today. The findings show that designs of this nature have intuitivesimilarities with psychedelic visual hallucinations.

Makale Başlığı: Spectral Disentangling of Binary Stars: ε Lupi
Özet: In this study, which is based on spectral disentangling in binary systems, ε Lupi (HD 136504) has been studied. ε Lupi is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (SB2) consisting of two early type B stars. A total of 575 spectra of ε Lupi downloaded from the PolarBase database were used for spectral disentangling. Before spectral disentangling, we cleaned telluric lines, merged orders, normalized the continuum of spectra. To obtain individual spectra of the components, FDBinary code was used. Consequently, the spectra of the components of the ε Lupi system were separated in the wavelength range 3920 - 8560 Å. The radial velocities and atmospheric parameters of the primary and secondary components will be found using with the resultant normalized spectra of ε Lupi.

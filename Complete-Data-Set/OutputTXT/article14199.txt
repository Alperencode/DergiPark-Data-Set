Makale Başlığı: Postmodern Consumers’ Tendency of Nostalgy: Generation Y
Özet: Younger individuals may have a tendency to nostalgia, similar to older individuals. Based on this assumption, in this study, it is aimed to examine the possible nostalgia tendency of generation Y consumers, who are considered to be postmodern consumers. For this purpose, the data of study were obtained with face-to-face interview, which is one of the qualitative data collection techniques. The interviews were held with 23 participants who visited a nostalgia-themed cafe in Eskişehir between 10.04.2019 and 20.04.2019. A semi-structured interview form was used to determine the opinions of participants. The findings obtained as a result of the study revealed that although participants consisted of relatively young individuals representing generation Y consumers, they had nostalgic tendencies. The results of the study are important in terms of revealing the consumption preferences of generation Y consumers with a tendency to nostalgia.

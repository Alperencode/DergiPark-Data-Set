Makale Başlığı: The Contribution of Shah Jalal in the Context of Bengal Islamization
Özet: Although the spread of political Islam in Bengal began in 1204, Sufi-dervishes had been active in Bengal for centuries. Following that, while Islamization activities continued in every corner of Bengal under the guidance of Sufi-dervishes, the number of Muslims progressively increased. As a Turkish Sufi, Shah Jalal’s engagement, in this case, was excessive. For us today, none of his offerings, including his service to Islam in Bengal, come as a surprise. Because Islamic pioneers like him attempted to build Islam in the Bengal  in a true manner. In this perspective, his efforts and sacrifices are unquestionably admired by the Bengali people. On the other hand, the primary goal of this research is to fill the gaps of research in Turkish academia and prove that he is a member of the Turk dynasty. In addition, to research historical data regarding his life, we’ll also take into account his arrival in India, as well as the meeting with Ibn Batuta and Jalal Tabrizi. In this context, we attempted to reach out to rare and fundamental accounts in terms of resources. We also used several modern resources in our investigation.

Makale Başlığı: The Investigation of the Effects of Different Seminal Plasma Heating Processes on Short Term Storage of the Akkaraman Kangal Ram Sperm
Özet: This research, seminal plasma in sperm was examined to determine the effect on sperm and to evaluate the use of reproductive purposes. For the research, the sperm obtained from 24-36 months of age 8 rams were used. Sperm was collected with the help of an electro-ejaculator out of mating season. The sperm collected were divided into 3 equal volumes after combining. It was kept to process in a 28 ⁰C water bath. The sperm were separated from the seminal plasma by centrifugation and combined with the sperm that is separated from after it was kept in 60 ⁰C and 80 ⁰C for 10 minutes and separated again in 28 ⁰C medium. The untreated control group and 60 ⁰C and 80 ⁰Cgroups were kept in a 4 ⁰C environment. Motility, live/dead ratio, and sperm abnormalities were recorded in 3 groups that were controlled once every 8 hours. According to the results of the study, when the control group and experimental groups were compared, the group with the longest duration of motility was determined as 80 ⁰C groups. Results of this study prove that, the denaturation of various proteins and enzymes in the seminal plasma of sperm directly proportional to lifetime, abnormalities, and motility.

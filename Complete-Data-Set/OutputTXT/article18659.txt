Makale Başlığı: Mechanical Analyses of Denim Fabrics Laminated with Recycled Polyethylene Packaging Wastes
Özet: Due to the increasing population and production rate in the world, the amount of waste accumulating in solid waste sites is increasing day by day. In particular, disposable packaging wastes go to landfills after they are used, and this situation poses a serious risk when evaluated in terms of solid waste management. On the other hand, the textile industry, which has a large production volume, causes tons of textile waste to be buried in solid waste sites. The major goal of this study is to produce 100% recycled laminated textiles by combining waste from denim fabric and polyethylene bottle caps, which are the priority waste categories for both industries. In this context, low and high density polyethylene waste bottle caps were recycled separately by the hot press method, and the matrix plates obtained were laminated to waste denim fabrics. The physical and mechanical properties of the produced laminated fabrics were tested, and the results were discussed by comparing them with the test results of polyethylene plates and denim fabrics. The findings demonstrated that high density polyethylene could be processed more easily in the lamination process and also imparted better mechanical properties to the fabric to which it was laminated compared to low density polyethylene. These laminated textiles with 100% waste content are expected to provide a sustainable substitute for value-added products that can be used especially in outdoor application areas such as awnings with their improved properties.

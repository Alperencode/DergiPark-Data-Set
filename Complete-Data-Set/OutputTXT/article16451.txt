Makale Başlığı: The Redundancy of Existence and the Feeling of Nausea in the Philosophy of Sartre
Özet: Existentialism is the common name of philosophies that emphasize the individual, focus on the problem of existence, and find traditionalist philosophy shallow. Therefore, it is possible to talk about existential philosophies, not a single existentialism. According to Sartre, an important existentialist philosopher, man, as a contingent being thrown to the earth, realizes the absurdity of existence when he becomes conscious of his redundancy. This realization makes him feel nauseous. In Sartre’s philosophy, nausea is an experience different from the feeling of anxiety experienced by the individual who realizes his freedom with the weight of his responsibilities. Nausea is the feeling of disgust felt by the individual who becomes conscious of his contingency. The human being, who is a being-in-itself with his body, experiences nausea on earth as being-for-itself with his consciousness and lives in a tense relationship with other. In this article, the categories of being-in-itself and being-for-itself, which are considered among the important concepts of Sartre’s phenomenological ontology, are examined and the existence of other is mentioned; In this study, the nature of the consciousness of redundancy and the feeling of nausea emerging in the context of the originary contingency of existence are emphasized. The aim of our study is to investigate the redundancy of being and the feeling of nausea in Sartre’s philosophy.

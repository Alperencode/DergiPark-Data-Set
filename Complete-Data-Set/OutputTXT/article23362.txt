Makale Başlığı: Ottoman-French Relations Before the Treaty Dated 1597
Özet: The course of the relations between the Ottoman Empire and France, which became an alliance during the reign of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman, passed through different periods after the Battle of Lepanto (1571). After the war, both the Sectarian Wars and the inter-state politics in Europe prompted France to protect its relations with the Ottomans. Likewise, the Ottoman Empire, with the long years of wars in the east and west in the last quarter of the sixteenth century, wanted to continue his aliance with France. Spain’s demand for peace and Britain’s attempts to obtain capulation and the priviliges of trade in Ottoman ports constituted the main topics in the relations between these two states. When Henry IV took the throne, he objected to the rapprochement between his state’s rivals and the Ottomans. He reorganized the political, military and commercial discourse during the Ottoman-Habsburg Wars. The Ottomans, on the other hand, tried to take the necessary steps in order not to allow France to compromise with the European states. Eventually, in 1597, the Ottoman Empire handed over a ahdnâme with new articles to his ally, France.

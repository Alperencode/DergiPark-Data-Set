Özet: Abstract: This article about “Keyfe Aṣbaḥte?” deals with the literary answers to the question. This question is sometimes called “How are you this morning?” sometimes “How did you wake up?”, sometimes directly “How are you?” carries such meanings. “Keyfe Aṣbaḥte?” the interesting answers given to the question have attracted the attention of many authors due to its high literary value and mystical meanings. This literary material, which is mostly poured from the lips of famous ascetics in the form of aphorisms and wise words, appears in the form of both prose and poetry in classical literature and ascetic books. The important aspect of these exemplary and amazing answers in terms of Arabic and rhetoric is that they are presented with artistic interests and have value in terms of oratory arts. Especially in these answers, it is seen that the “badīʿ” arts such as “sajae”, “ṭibāḳ”, “muḳābala” are used skillfully.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Trust Among Employees on Dysfunctional Behavior and the Mediating Role of Management’s Positive Behavior: A Theory of Values Analysis
Özet: In the activities of the employees in an organization, trust, positive behavior, and dysfunctional behavior can be investigated as a whole, in addition to the universal principles of the theory of values. In previous studies, the concepts of trust among colleagues (TYC), dysfunctional behavior (EDB), and positive behavior of management towards employees (PBM) in organizations were examined separately in different areas. Unlike in previous studies, these concepts were, in this study, applied together to employees in different organizations. In this research, employees’ trust in one another positively and significantly affected their dysfunctional behavior. Employees’ trust in one another also positively and significantly affected their management’s positive behavior towards employees. The positive behavior of the management towards their employees in turn affected the dysfunctional behavior of the employees in a positive and meaningful way. In the study, the positive behavior of the management towards their employees had a full mediator effect on the impact of employees’ trust one another on employees' dysfunctional behaviors.

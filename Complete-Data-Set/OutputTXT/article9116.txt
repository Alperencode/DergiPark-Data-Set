Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Conspicuous Consumption Behavior on Wasteful Consumption Behavior: The Intermediary Role of Hedonic Consumption Behavior
Özet: The  concept  of  consumption,  which  has  an  important  place  in  people's  lives,  is  generally  expressed  as  the  use  of  produced  goods  and  services  in  line  with  needs.  Consumption  now  includes  the  psychological  needs  of  people  as  well  as  their  physical  needs.  Consumers  can  buy  things  they   do   not   need   by   acting   pleasure-orientedly,   and   they   exhibit   consumption behaviors to provide psychological satisfaction. One of the consumer-purchase patterns is found to demonstrate others in the social environment.  Therefore,  non-need  consumption  focused  on  pleasure  and  display  causes  excessive  consumption;  this  situation  can  also  cause  wastefulness. Accordingly, in the present study, the aim was to examine the effect of conspicuous consumption behavior on wasteful consumption behavior  and  the  mediating  role  of  hedonic  consumption  behavior  in  this  effect.  With  the  online  survey  form  prepared,  519  participants  were  reached between the dates of 21.05.2020-06.07.2020. The data obtained were  analyzed  with  the  SPSS  21,  AMOS  24,  and  PROCESS  3.5  programs.  After   the   analysis,   it   was   concluded   that   conspicuous   consumption   behavior  has  an  effect  on  wasteful  consumption  behavior  and  that  hedonic consumption behavior has a mediating effect.

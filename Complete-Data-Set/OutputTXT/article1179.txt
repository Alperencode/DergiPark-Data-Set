Makale Başlığı: Production of Green Table Olives in Different Brine Concentrations and Determination of  Chemical and Microbiological Properties of the Product
Özet: The purpose of table olive production is to sweeten the olive by reducing the bitterness substance called oleuropein in its structure and to preserve it for a long time by giving the olives durability with brine. The goal of this study was to produce traditional green table olives with various salt concentrations from olive varieties grown in Kahramanmaraş province, as well as to determine the chemical and microbiological properties of the table olives obtained during the first, seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first day fermentation processes. It was also determined that it complied with the Food Codex table olive communiqué. Two different types of brine were used: 5% and 7% for pickled olives. pH 4,35-6,62, salt 3,72%-9,71%, titration acidity 0,05%-0,33%, protein 2,52%-5,36%, dry matter 21,53%-49,25%, ash 1,18%-3,20% contents were all determined in all brine olives produced and lactic acid bacteria 0.1-4.6 log cfu/mL, yeast count as 0.2-8.8 log cfu/mL were determined. In addition, the identification of Lactobacillus plantarum from lactic acid bacteria found in the flora was carried out molecularly.

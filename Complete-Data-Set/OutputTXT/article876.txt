Makale Başlığı: The 2nd:4th digit ratio and shooting skill performance in Basketball Players
Özet: AbstractThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 2d:4d digit ratio on shooting performance in basketball players.  30 male and 30 female basketball players who have been actively playing basketball for 3 years at the age of 15±04.1.69 participated in the study.  Participants were asked to score 5 shots from the free throw line by scoring between 0 and 5 to determine their basketball shooting skill performance.  To determine finger length, the second finger (2D) and fourth finger (4D) (Figure 3) were measured using a 0-150 mm (USA, Cocraft) Vernier digital caliper with an accuracy of 0.01 mm in millimeters (mm).  In addition, the 20 Meter Shuttle Running Test was applied to measure the endurance of the participants.  Independent sample T-Test and Pearson correlation test were used for statistical analysis. There was no significant difference in the participants' shot parameters, Shuttle Run Test and other 2D and 4D parameters (p>0.05).  There was a negative correlation between the 20 Meter Shuttle Running Test and the left hand 2d:4d variables of the participants (p<0.05). There was no significant relationship between the total shot performance of the participants and the parameters of the 20 Meter Shuttle Running Test and 2d:4d digit ratio (p>0.05). It was found that there was no effect between 2D: 4D and aerobic performance and shooting in adolescent male and female basketball players. This result may be due to the age, training level and heterogeneity of the sample group.

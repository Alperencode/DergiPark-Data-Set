The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of Parkinson's disease that cause early retirement.Methods: Seventy-five patients with Parkinson’s disease (mean age: 59.10±9.20 years) participated in this study. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with patients within the framework of 29 questions determined by the researchers by examining the literature and similar studies.Results: Participants have been analyzed into groups: Retirement types and reasons for retirement. Patients that quit their jobs because of Parkinson's disease stated that bradykinesia in motor symptoms, somnipathy, and depression in non-motor symptoms came first in their reasons for retirement. It has been determined that 90% of participants that quit their jobs because of Parkinson's disease were not supported by the institutions they worked for, 77.55% couldn't receive physiotherapy treatment and 61.22% couldn't receive psychological therapy. In addition, it has been determined that 55.1% of the participants would like to work if they find a suitable job.Conclusion: For patients to stay in the workforce longer, patients with Parkinson's disease, their caregivers, and employers should be informed about the health problems associated with Parkinson's disease, their possible consequences, as well as strategies and treatment techniques developed for motor and non motor symptoms.

Makale Başlığı: German nationalism as a language-based construct
Özet: Benedict Anderson defined the nation as an imagined community. He assumes that both the nation and nationalism are a particular kind of cultural construction. Therefore, in order for a nation to emerge, a “shared cultural past”, a “common history”, and “binding structures” must be invented to provide a sense of belonging to a common and homogeneous identity. It is noteworthy that different nations have preferred different “binding structures”. Historiography, cultural characteristics, territorial unity, ethnicity, language, mythology, etc. The way binding components come together in different national identities determines the character of nations. The fact that the German peoples were scattered over wide areas as principalities for a long time in history delayed their unification into one nation under the umbrella of a single state. As a result, the German language has taken a different and more central position in the formation of German national identity than other national identity models and has come to the fore as the main feature of national identity. In this framework, the aim of this article is to examine the characteristics of German nationalism in the context of the problem of national identity and, departing from Anja Stuckenbrock and Andreas Gardt’s concept of language nationalism to explore the special relationship between the German language and the German nation until the 19th century.

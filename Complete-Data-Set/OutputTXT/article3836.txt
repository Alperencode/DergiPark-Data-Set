Makale Başlığı: THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE OTTOMAN STATE RENEWAL EFFORT TO ATATÜRK'S EDUCATION AND THE TURKISH WORLD JEDIT MOVEMENT
Özet: The concept of jadid, which means "new", and "jaditcilik", which means "innovative", started to be used in the literature with the detection of the deterioration of madrasah education. Since it was known that the deterioration would start in education and spread to the whole society, it was thought that the innovation that would start in education would improve the entire state and social life. However, the madrasahs, which are known to be the cause of deterioration, did not want to lose their authority in education as in every field. Innovators, on the other hand, started to look for solutions in order to save schools from the influence of madrasahs and to provide education with new methods, techniques and tools. In order to find a solution to the madrasa education, which became outdated or dysfunctional because it could not renew itself as a result of these searches, the Ottoman Empire first started to renovate the military field and schools in a Western style. These efforts continued with the Tanzimat Era in civilian schools and institutions. Atatürk, who was born in this process, was brought up in schools that gave education in the new style. In the Turkish world, solutions were sought with the experience of innovation in Russia, Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The aim of the Turks in the Ottoman and Russian geography was to become a modern society on the basis of the Renaissance, reform and enlightenment that started in Europe.

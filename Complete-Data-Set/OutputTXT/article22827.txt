Özet: AbstractThe coronavirus epidemic causes fear and anxiety in all individuals in the society, especially in parents. This is a condition that triggers many psychological symptoms in both the parent and the child. This study was conducted to determine the fear and anxiety levels of parents who suspect that their child may have COVID-19 during the coronavirus epidemic. 410 parents who took their children to the Emergency Department of the Pediatrics unit were included in the study. Data were collected using the “personal information form,” “The Fear of COVID-19 Scale,” and “State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)” and analyzed through the SPSS software. It was determined that the participant parents had moderate (19.69±6.30) fear, moderate Trait (42.93±5.12), and moderate State Anxiety (43.90±6.56), and there was a significant relationship between the Fear of COVID-19 and Trait Anxiety (R=0.117, R2=0.0147, F(1. 408) =5.629, p=0.018).

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Financial Risks on Firm Values of Firms Included in BIST 30 Index (2010-2020)
Özet: In recent years, the development and deepening seen in financial markets cause financial risks to diversify. Financial risks have serious effects on firm value. For this reason, while companies aim to maximize firm value, they will also try to minimize the effects of risks that will negatively affect their financial structures. In the study, it is aimed to test the possible effects of financial risks on firm value with panel data analysis. For this purpose, 27 companies in the BIST 30 index were examined in the 2010-2020 period. The data of the remaining 3 companies could not be reached and this situation constitutes the limitation of the study. In the models created within the scope of the study, PP/DD and Tobin Q were preferred to represent the firm value, and credit risk, currency (currency) risk, liquidity risk, interest risk and financial leverage ratio were preferred for financial risks. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that exchange rate risk and credit risk affect firm value negatively, while liquidity risk affects positively. A possible unit increase in liquidity risk increases the firm's value by 0.35 percent. The direct ratio between risk and return represents the plus side of this situation. Unlike other studies that examine the sensitivity of firm value to financial risks, the study is unique in that it covers the post-covid19 economic process in the 2010-2020 period and contributes to the literature.

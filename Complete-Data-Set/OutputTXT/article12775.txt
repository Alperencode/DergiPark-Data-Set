Makale Başlığı: Determination of Aflatoxin B1 and Total Aflatoxin (B1,B2,G1,G2) Content in Red Peppers and Dried Figs Sold in Çukurova and the Eastern Mediterranean Region by High Performance Liquid Chromatography Method
Özet: Aflatoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by molds that can harm other organisms. In this research, 8 samples each from Adana, red chili peppers and dried figs, 9 each from Mersin and 8 samples from Osmaniye were obtained from small-scale farmers, retail stores and supermarkets. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), aflatoxin G2 (AFG2) and total aflatoxin (AF) contents of red chili pepper and dried fig samples were investigated. HPLC with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD) was used to measure AF amounts. The lowest detectable limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.1 to 0.42 µg kg −1, and the limit of detection (LOQ) ranged from 0.11 to 0.45 µg kg -1. Total AF was detected in 44% (11 samples) of 25 dried fig samples. Concentrations of AFs ranged from 0.10 to 0.19 μg kg −1. AFB1 was detected in 36% (9 specimens) and AFG1 in 24% (6 specimens).  It was determined that 28% (7 pieces) of red chili pepper samples did not comply with the standards in terms of AFB1. Total AF was detected in 16% (4 pieces) of pepper samples. The values of the samples in which aflatoxin was detected are above the legal values determined by the “Communiqué on Maximum Limits of Contaminants in Foodstuffs (2011/28157)”.

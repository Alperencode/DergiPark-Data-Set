Makale Başlığı: Exploring the Association Between Students’ Views on Self-Regulated Learning and Academic Achievement in Emergency Remote Learning
Özet: The present study aimed to explore higher education students’ self-regulated learning in three types of interaction in emergency remote learning and the associations of these situations with their academic achievement and some demographic variables. The sample consisted of 913 students at a state university of the 2020-2021 academic year in Turkey. The findings revealed that the students mostly adopted free virtual classroom applications in emergency remote learning and used their smartphones as an important tool to participate in online classes through their home internet and mobile data. It was also found that the older students had higher self-regulated learning scores than the younger ones. Not surprisingly, it was also the case between senior and junior students. The associate degree students had a higher mean self-regulated learning score than the undergraduate students. Finally, the participants majoring in social sciences and those enrolled in associate degree programs scored higher on the Online Self-Regulation Questionnaire than the science, engineering, health sciences, and teaching students. Furthermore, it was concluded that the students with a high level of self-regulated learning had greater academic achievement. Therefore, it can be asserted that achievement is a remarkable factor associated with self-regulated learning in online learning environments.

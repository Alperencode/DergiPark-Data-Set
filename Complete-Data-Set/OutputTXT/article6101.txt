Makale Başlığı: Experimental Investigation of the Dishwasher Cleaning Performance
Özet: Today, with the advancement of technology, studies on machines that make human life easier have also increased. While the companies in the sector compete with each other, they work hard to design machines that make a difference and to improve customer perception. In present study, a lower spray arm mechanism was designed to increase the washing efficiency of dishwashers and to reduce the noise level during operation. The washing performance of dishwashers could be increased with long washing times and the use of chemicals. However it causes increasing water and energy consumption, as well as environmental effect. For this reason, it has been aimed to improve the cleaning performance with the help of water jet, which is defined as the mechanical effect. For this purpose, a new mechanism design with planet spray arm, which allows sweep more area in the interior volume of the dishwasher, has been realized. The washing performance of the dishwasher, in which this planet spray arm mechanism is used, has been experimentally investigated in accordance with the EN 50242 Standard. The washing performance has been improved by 6.14% and dramatic decreases in sound level were observed.

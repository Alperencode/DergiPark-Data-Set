Makale Başlığı: An Analysis on the Preschool Piano Methods in terms of Early Childhood Development Stages
Özet: This research aims to examine preschool piano methods in terms of early childhood developmental stages. The research aims to determine how the selected methods fit the determined visual, technical, musical, theoretical, and developmental characteristics. Preschool piano methods selected by the researcher were evaluated by the document analysis method. The examination criteria prepared to examine the methods in terms of visual, technical, musical, theoretical, and developmental aspects were presented to the expert opinion and rearranged and took their final form. The methods in the research, Bastiens' Invitation to Music by Jane Smisor Bastien, Lisa Bastien and Lori Bastien, My First Piano Adventure by Nancy Faber and Randall Faber, Preschool Piano Education by Nail Yavuzoğlu, Piano Method for Preschool Children by Yalçın Iman, which were chosen by purposeful sampling method among non-random sampling methods were examined by five experts in the field. Content analysis was used in the analysis of the data obtained. The data obtained in line with the answers given by the experts were presented in tables with frequency and percentage numbers. As a result of the research, it was seen that there is no complete, well-prepared, and perfect method among the examined pre-school piano methods. It was concluded that methods other than Iman's method, among the examined methods, were more suitable for the pre-school period. Although the methods examined in the study have some shortcomings, their use in pre-school piano education has been found appropriate and recommended.

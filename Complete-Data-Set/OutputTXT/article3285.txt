Özet: In 1969, during archaeological excavations under the direction of Prof. Dr. Yusuf Boysal in Bozukbağ within the borders of Yeşilbağcılar neighborhood of the Yatağan district of Muğla province around the area where the tombs belonging to the Late Geometric, Late Classical and Roman periods were found, the remains of a building that did not have a full plan at foundation level were unearthed during the studies conducted by the directorate of the Muğla Museum. An Asclepius figurine was found at the upper level near the corner of the remains of this building. The figurine belongs to the Eleusis type and is depicted with a serpent staff. Although the existence of two Asclepius torsos, one of which is a Gymnasion find and the other of which, the findspot is unknown, among Stratonikeia sculptural works, the Asclepius figurine was not found in the Stratonikeia choroplastic art. Therefore, the Bozukbağ Asklepios sculpture and its context obtain a special importance as it is a complete artifact and an excavated find that shows the existence of the Asklepios cult at Stratonikeia and in its surroundings. According to the find location and style characteristics, the Roman period copy of the Asklepios statuette, which is the subject of this study, has been dated to between the half of the II. century A.D. and the first half of the III. century A.D.

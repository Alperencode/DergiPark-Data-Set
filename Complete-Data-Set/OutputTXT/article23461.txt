Makale Başlığı: Examining the Changing Perception of the Society on Interest Loan: An Interview Study
Özet: Interest is a prohibited transaction for people who believe in Islam. On the other hand; interest-bearing transactionscan be seen in many places with the increasing financialization in the current economic system. The purpose of thisstudy is to determine the position of interest, which plays a key role in the current capitalist system, in the eyes ofindividuals, based on the above-mentioned principle of the prohibition of interest. It will also be learned how theinstitutions that try to fulfill the principles of Islamic economics are evaluated by society. The qualitative researchmethod was used throughout this study. The interview technique was preferred to collect data in qualitative research.The number of individuals participating in the interview was determined as twenty-three. According to the mainfindings, the most of individuals participating in the interview apply to banks without asking to borrow money fromtheir around. It draws the attention that social relations are not adequately inclusive in financial matters. It has beendetermined that the number of individuals knowing alternative institutions, which is one of the ways to find theamount of financing they need, is low among the individuals we interviewed for our study. The main factor in thesedecisions of individuals who think to take interest loans again is that they have “a worldview based on not delayingtheir dreams”. It should be ensured that institutions such as Karz-ı hasen, which are established on the basis of trust,become widespread with the help of necessary policies.

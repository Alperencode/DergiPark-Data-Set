Makale Başlığı: Istihsan With Hidden Analogy (Qiyas Khafi)
Özet: Istiḥsan is a type of ijtihad covering four different deduction ways that differ in logic and functioning. Three of these deduction methods have the quality of exceptions, yet the other one depends on the logic of preferring one of the two opposite qiyas options, which can be applied for case to be solved. This study analyses the type of deduction called istiḥsan with khafi qiyas (istiḥsan with the hidden analogy). The subject is analyzed in the following way: First, to set a basis for the issue to be addressed, the definition of istiḥsan is given, and the essence of the qiyas rejected due to istiḥsan is scrutinized. To compare types of istiḥsan, the kinds of istiḥsan with the quality of exception are briefly mentioned. Finally, the main topic of the study, istiḥsan with khafi qiyas, is analyzed in terms of its quality, the difference from other types of istiḥsan, and the reason why it is preferred over dhahir qiyas.

Makale Başlığı: A Tax Applied as an Indicator of Ability to Pay in England: Hearth Tax
Özet: Throughout history in England, taxes have been imposed on many items such as hats, leather, salt, windows, wallpaper and soap. England is especially important in terms of the reflection of the military and political developments in the 17th and 18th centuries on the field of public finance and therefore itsdifference in determining new taxes in line with the various economic and financial problems that the country is experiencing. Due to these features, in this study, it is aimed to examine and evaluate the hearth tax, which is one of the interesting taxes applied in England. Hearth tax was applied as an indicator of ability to pay in England in the period of 1662-1689 and was important in determining many issues such as population, ability to pay and the level of wealth. However, there were many reactions against this tax, such as not allowing the collectors to make the list, leaving the properties empty, closing the hearths and not paying the tax. On the other hand; hearth tax has been criticized due to the complexity of the exemptions and taxation principles, the fact that the lists made in some regions do not clearly reflect the truth, and that inter-regional comparisons can not be made effectively. The most important reason for criticism was the thought that the number of hearths did not reflect the ability to pay. As a matter of fact, the focus of this criticism has been the idea that some properties with a high number of hearths are used for commercial purposes, while others are shared between families and can not be an indicator of wealth. In the study, hearth tax has been examined in terms of its features, principles of application, reactions to the tax and some classifications for the cities whose data can be obtained, and some evaluations have been made about the way it is applied.

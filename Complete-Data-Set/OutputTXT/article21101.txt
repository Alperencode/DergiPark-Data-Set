Makale Başlığı: HEROIC FORM OF LORD RAGLAN AND KHAN ORBA
Özet: ABSTRACT  Character cadre is one of the most important dynamics of plot in oral based literary genre. Character cadre could be rich or consist of only one character according to the properties of the genre. As a product of folk literature, epics -short or long – prose or poetical- have a rich cadre of characters and pool of pivotal/ secondary heroes. Despite the fact that volume of the product is critical, root of the plot is shaped upon the hero/es. Structural analysis based on hero of the epic has been done in West and East literatures. Lord Raglan’s study is also very important for the issue in addition to the studies of J.G. von Hahn, Otto Rank, Axel Olrik, Thomas Carlyle, Eric Hobsbawm, C.W.Bowra, Joseph Campbell, Dean A. Miller and Ye. M. Meletinsky. Raglan’s study, which focused on the Latin and Middle Eastern epic heroes and consisted of twenty two matters, was also applied to some of the Turkish epic heroes by the researchers of Turkish field. The researchers explored the similarities and differences with Raglan’s model.  In this paper we will analyze Han Orba within the framework of Raglan’s model.  Han Orba, which takes place in the epic tradition of South Siberian Turks, is an epic of Khakas Turks and its pivotal hero is a woman: Han Orba. By doing so we intend to put forward the similarities and differences between Raglan’s heroes and Turkish ones and make some analyses in the light of Han Orba.   Key Words: Lord Raglan, Khassian Turks, traditional hero pattern, Khan Orba

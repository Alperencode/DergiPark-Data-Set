Makale Başlığı: Middle School Students’ Cognitive Structures About Mutation, Modification, and Adaptation Concepts: Drawing and Writing Technique
Özet: This study aims to determine the cognitive structures of the 8th-grade middle school students after teaching the concepts of mutation, modification, and adaptation in the unit of DNA and Genetic Code. Those concepts in the Turkish Science Education Curriculum included the skills such as defining the terms, making explanations on the reasons, explaining the expected results, giving critical examples of each concept, and making analogies. When the literature is examined, it is seen that studies on genetics focus on misconceptions in general. This study is based on a deeper understanding of how mutation, modification, and adaptation concepts could be constructed in mental structures of the students. A case study design known as a qualitative research model was used in the study. The study group included eight grade 27 students consisted of 12 female and 17 male ones who are attending at a private school in Balıkesir in the 2020-2021 academic year. Data were collected by drawing and writing form and analyzed by content analysis technique. Data were collected with the drawing and writing form, and the descriptive and content analysis techniques were used in the evaluation process. The study results revealed that some students had incomplete knowledge of related concepts although they had some correct explanations on such content. These results are important for understanding how the concepts related to genetics, which have abstract characteristics to some degree, are included in the cognitive structures of students.

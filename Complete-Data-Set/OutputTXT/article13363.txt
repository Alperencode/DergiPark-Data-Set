Makale Başlığı: Similarities of Şanlıurfa Arabic with Iraqi and Gulf Arabic
Özet: As a result of the Arab-Islamic conquests during the reign of Caliph Omar between 634 and 644, the Arab-Islamic army under the command of Iyâz Gunm (d.641) conquered the geography in 640 called the al-Cezire region, which is now called the Southeastern Anatolia Region. Since it is surrounded by the Euphrates in the west and the Tigris rivers in the east and waters on both sides, Muslim-Arab geographers named this region 'al-Jazeera' (الجَزِيرَة), which means island in Arabic. Westerners to the region Mesopotamia, Syriacs; They gave the name ‘Beyne Nehreyn’ (بَيْنَ النَّهْرين) which means between two rivers. After the conquests, the Banu Mudar tribe settled in the al-Jazeera region, which includes Urfa. Members of this tribe continue to speak Arabic to this day. In addition, Şanlıurfa Arabic, which is an extension of the local Arabic spoken in Iraq, is quite different from the Arabic spoken in Turkey in Hatay, Mardin and Siirt.The Urfa Arabs, whose ancestry is based on the Banu Mudar tribe and who lived an introverted and isolated life for many years, were able to preserve the Arabic words and phrases they used in their daily language. In this way, Urfa Arabic was able to maintain its feature of being more clear and understandable than the Arabic of Hatay, Mardin and Siirt. Also, someone who speaks Urfa local Arabic can more easily communicate with Arabs of Iraq and Gulf countries (Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain). The aim of this study is to give information about the origin, emergence, words and phrases of Arabic spoken in Şanlıurfa, which is the fourth language used in our country after Turkish, Kurdish and Zazaki.

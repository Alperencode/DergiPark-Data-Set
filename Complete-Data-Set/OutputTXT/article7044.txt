Makale Başlığı: THE MEMORY OF THE WOMAN IN THE PAINTING
Özet: Ahmet Muhip Dıranas, who stands out with his poet identity, also has works in the theater genre. Dranas' play Shadows is the drama of an old Father. Apart from Father, there are Mother, Son, Daughter, Fiancee, Neighbor, Woman in Pomegranate Flower Dress, Young Man, Doctor, Butler, Servant. The Father's bond with memories is stronger than with reality. For this reason, the game has been analyzed in the context of memories. The father is a person who has entered the path of old age. He took refuge in his memories because he was not satisfied with the life he lived. At the center of her memories is the Woman in Pomegranate Flower Dress. He connects to the past and life with his portrait in the painting. The Woman Dressed in Pomegranate Flower points to thirty-five years ago. The woman still stands in the painting as a young and beautiful young girl. In fact, the Father is also in the past. Because the Woman Dressed in Pomegranate Flower is to represent the love that was left incomplete. It is in vain that he tries to fill this deficiency with the memory of the woman. The object of desire that creates the deficiency is the woman herself. In this respect, the painting with the portrait of the Woman Dressed in the Pomegranate Flower is not an object. Table; It is like a living being that comes between Father and Mother, Son and Daughter. It is the unforgettable memory that makes the house uncanny.

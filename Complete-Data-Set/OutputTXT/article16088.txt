Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Parking Problem of the Central District of Canakkale With the Geographical Information System (GIS) and Solution Suggestions
Özet: The aim of this study is to analyse the parking problem holistically within the framework of transportation and attraction centers with the help of Geographical Information Systems and to propose parking policies integrated with transportation. For the spatial analysis of the parking problem of the Central District of Canakkale Province, which is the study area, a relational geographic database of parking lots, transportation and traffic attraction centers has been established. The need for parking has been determined with the calculation method used in Germany and accepted all over the world. As a result of the queries and analyses made in the database established for the study area, it was examined whether the roads are suitable for on-road park planning. Thanks to the model created with ModelBuilder, neighbourhood-based on-road parking supply capacity was calculated for parallel parking. Accessibility was measured by transportation analysis. According to the walking distance from the attraction centers, within a 250 m service area; Is there an off-road parking area, can it be accessed in terms of public transportation, can it be accessed in terms of existing bicycle stations, which of the roads within walking distance are suitable for parking and what is their capacity?

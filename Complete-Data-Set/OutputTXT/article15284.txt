Makale Başlığı: Myth and Intertextuality in Online Games: Example of “Smite”
Özet: Games have been digitalized along with the development of technology in the historical pro cess, and they have started to take place on online platforms with the usage of the internet. Today, the masses that come together through online digital games can exchange ideas both between the game itself and gamers. Online games, which have diversified in terms of subject and processing over time, have also enabled the enrichment of the communication source between the game and the user. This structure of digital games makes them a source of infor mation other than their primary production purposes. Establishing a link between the narra tive presented to the player and the mythical texts also enables the examination of digital ga mes in the context of intertextuality. For this reason, content analysis and intertextual analysis methods were applied, and the texts of "Smite", which constitute the sample, were discussed within the scope of intertextuality in a mythical context. In the light of the data obtained, it has been determined that in the narratives of online games, mythical texts are used through intertextuality. The determination of the mythical elements in the narrative of digital games is an important issue in order to examine the digital game narrative in depth.

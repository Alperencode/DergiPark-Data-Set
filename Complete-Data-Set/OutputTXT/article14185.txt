Makale Başlığı: Revisiting the Akhi Order: Research on Akhi Values and the Perception of Anatolian People
Özet: Akhi is an important system that guided social and commercial life in Anatolia from the 13th century to the beginning of the 20th century. The Akhi Organisations, shaped by the Akhi system of thought, became important social aid and non-governmental organisations of their time. Even though the Akhi organisations legally disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century and were replaced by other organisations, the Akhi thought system continues to be in effect in Anatolia as a cultural heritage. Today, it is quite important for Anatolian people that tradesmen embrace Akhi values closely. This study investigates Anatolian people’s perception of tradesmen’s Akhi values. Customers’ perception of values of the Akhi community is measured via general and sub-dimensions, and its relationship with demographic characteristics is examined through a survey method. The survey data, evaluated by the SPSS 25.0 program, is subjected to Cronbach Alpha, factor, frequency, t-test and a one-way ANOVA test. As a result of the study, it is determined that the participants have a moderate level of perception of the Akhi community and the demographic characteristics of the participants have a significant effect on the perception of values of the Akhi community.

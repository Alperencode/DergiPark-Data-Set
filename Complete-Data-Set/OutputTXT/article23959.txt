Makale Başlığı: Effects of Different Sintering Protocols on Color Stability of Monolithic Zirconia
Özet: Aim: The aim of the study is to examine the effects of applying different sintering protocols on the color stability of multilayer monolithic zirconia restorations containing different zirconia types.Material and Method: The samples used in our study were produced from pressinterized A2 colored multilayer monolithic zirconia block(IPS e.max ZirCAD Prime,Ivoclar Vivadent,Schaan,Liechtenstein) using CAD/CAM technology. The samples were divided into three groups(n=15) and sintered in three different protocols as standard, speed and high speed (Programat S2, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Glaze as a surface finishing process was applied to samples. L, a, b values were determined by measuring the color of the samples and the color A2 in VITA Classical color scale (VITA Zahnfabrik,Bad Säckingen,Germany) with a spectrophotometer(SpektroShade,MHT Optic Research,Niederhasli,Switzerland). L1, a1, b1 values are fixed and the color A2 in the color scale, L2, a2, ∆E00 values of each group were calculated according to the CIEDE2000 system, provided that b2 values represent standard, speed and high speed sintering protocols, respectively. Statistical analysis of the study was made with One-Way Analysis of Variance and multiple comparisons were made with Tukey HSD Test (significance level was taken as p<0,05).Results: When the detectable limit of ΔE00 was determined as ΔE00≤1.30 and the acceptability limit as ΔE00>2.25, it was determined that all groups formed according to different sintering protocols created a clinically significant color difference when compared with the color scale. While the lowest ∆E00 value was observed in the group in which the standard sintering protocol was applied (∆E00=5.77) (p<0,001), the highest ∆E00 value was observed in the group in which the speed sintering protocol was applied(∆E00=7.54)(p<0,001). However, there was a difference in L2, a2, b2 values for all groups depending on the change in the sintering protocol.Conclusion: Since increase in sintering temperature and waiting times affects grain structure and phase transformations of Zirconia and therefore optical properties of the material such as light scattering and light transmission, it is recommended to use the standard protocol in cases where time is limitless, and to prefer high-speed sintering protocol over speed protocol in cases with time limitations.

Makale Başlığı: Two Qur'anic Recipes: Tasbih and İstighfar
Özet: The Qur'an is the last divine book that reminds people of the purpose of existence, their duty and responsibility towards the creator and the created, as a guide to guidance. Every word in this book is addressed to all people in general and believers in particular. This divine book, which sheds light on the material and spiritual life of man, contains principles that will make him happy. It is like a prescription written by a doctor to his patient and is a source of mercy and healing offered by the Lord to his believing servants. Tasbih and istigfar are the two divine requests in this prescription. Tasbih is to absolve Almighty Allah from deficient attributes; Istighfar is asking for forgiveness and forgiveness from Him. The Qur'an states that all beings in the universe praise Allah according to their own creation characteristics; reminds that a person in a valuable position is also responsible for such a task. This issue, which adds meaning to the material and spiritual life of a person, reminds the person of his creator and his servitude, and inspires hope and tranquility when faced with troubles and troubles, is always important. In this study, first of all, the two basic qualities of people with intelligence, contemplation and contemplation, are emphasized, and then the analysis, nature, importance, material and spiritual benefits of the concepts of tasbih and istighfar, which are the manifestation of communication between Allah and the servant, are emphasized.

Makale Başlığı: Digital Transformation and The Future of Work and Women: The Case of The European Union
Özet: Digital transformation and technological advances are in the process of transforming work. This transformation is perceived both as a threat or an opportunity by workers, citizens, policymakers, and businesses. Whether and to what extent the digital transformation will qualitatively change labor markets and welfare states is intensely debated. When these topics are evaluated in terms of gender, how women are positioned in the labor market where new technologies occur becomes significant. This study examines the effects of digital transformation on women in the labor market in the European Union (EU) context. The research question of how digital transformation affects women in the context of the future of work will be examined within the framework of the discussions on gender and digital transformation in the labor market, use of technology, digital skills, and gender stereotyping in the labor market, artificial intelligence (AI), cyber violence, and care work.

Makale Başlığı: Transmission of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Case of the Turkic World Foundation (Eskişehir)
Özet: This study is about the role played by the Turkic World Foundation in Eskişehir, for the transmission of intangible Turkish cultural heritage. The International Organization of Turkic Culture (TURKSOY) takes on responsibility in various stages of this transmission that includes ancient Turkic societies’ rich, common culture, filtering through thousands of years to the present, and qualifies it as an evidential source of information. The second city of "Cultural Capital of the Turkic World," which TURKSOY adopted as an initiative to strengthen the common cultural identities of Turkic peoples, was Eskişehir, which features the characterization of Turkey's modern face. After the completed mission of Eskişehir Turkish World Culture Capital Agency, 2013 at the end of 2014, the Turkic World Foundation was established both to complete unfinished permanent works and to satisfy the public demand. It is doubtless that the two organizations named above have created value in the new period to construct the identity of Eskişehir even though their existence and actions are subject to debate in local politics. The Turkic World Foundation, which hosts numerous cultural and art events, has completed permanent work projects, contributing to the development of cultural links when continuing to play a role in the transmission of cultural heritage safely to its future generations.

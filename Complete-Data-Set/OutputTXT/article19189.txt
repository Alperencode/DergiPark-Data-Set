Makale Başlığı: Probiotics in Candida Infections: Ten Years Experience in Single Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
Özet: Objectives: Candida species are one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal population. The probiotic use is not well documented in candida infections in neonates. The aim of this study was to evaluate candida infections in neonatal intensive care unit.Methods: A retrospective single-center, matched, case-control study was designed to identify individual risk factors for Candida infection in the NICU. Patients enrolled in the analysis were all neonates who were in the NICU during the study period for at least 72 h. For each case, 2 control cases with negative blood culture were matched on 3 factors: gestational age, birth weight, hospitalization time (within 1week compared to case patients).Results: 7696 newborns were admitted to and hospitalized >72 h in the NICU for eleven years and 51 cases (0.66 %) were followed with candida infection. Probiotic usage was higher in control group. Surgical interventions, central venous lines and parenteral nutrition duration, multiple antibiotic usages were found to be risk factors for candida infections. Conclusion: In NICU we should effectively focus on increasing using of probiotics, besides decreasing the overall use of multiple antibiotics, improving catheter care to reduce the incidence of candida infections. Probiotics might have protective effect against candida infections.

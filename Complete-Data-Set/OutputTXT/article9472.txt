Makale Başlığı: Diagnostic value of delta neutrophil index in determining axillary metastases in breast cancer
Özet: Aim: The delta neutrophil index (DNI), which shows the percentage of immature granulocytes (IG) in peripheral blood in inflammatory conditions, is an indicator of increased bone marrow activation. Its ability to predict prognosis has been demonstrated in many cancer studies. This study aims to investigate the value of DNI in predicting axillary metastases in breast cancer.Material and Method: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and operated on axillary lymph node dissection were screened and 127 patients were included in the study. The patient’s age, gender, operation time, length of hospital stay, immature granulocyte (IG) percentages (IG#), and axillary lymph node pathology results were retrospectively scanned from the archive system.Results: DNI and IG were statistically higher in the group with lymph node metastasis. When examined for IG#, the mean of the group with reactive lymph nodes was 0.02±0.02, while the mean of the metastatic group was 0.04±0.05. This statistically significant difference was high (p<0.001). Cut-off values of 0.035 (OR 4.133, CI 95% 0.589-0.777, p<0.001) were found with 40% sensitivity and 86.1% specificity for the differentiation IG# of metastasis among patients.Conclusion: DNI and IG count may be new predictive markers with high sensitivity and specificity in detecting axillary metastasis of breast cancer.

Makale Başlığı: Kazakh Epic Janibek Batır
Özet: There are many opinions about the Kazakhs being one of the Turkish tribes living in Central Asia since the time of the Saka-Scythians and appearing on the stage of history. According to the most common view, Kazakhs emerged when a community that did not comply with Abulhayhan Khan tended to live in a nomadic way between the Chu and Talas rivers. In Kazakh Turkish, the word dastan corresponds to the words jir, epos, köne epos, dastan. For heroic epics, batir jiri, batik epos, heroic epos; love epics are used as gaşıgtik jir, romandik epos, liro epostik jir. As in most epic traditions, Kazakh epics are sung in a mixed form in verse and prose, and traditional instruments such as dombra and kopuz are used in the verse. Telling an epic is called jirla-. While heroic epics are sung in the style of jır, love epics are told in the style of black dead. This epic, which is in the library of Muhtar Avezov Literature and Art Institute, is a copy of Aqıt Qajji Ülimjiwlı. Taken from the fifty-ninth volume of the multi-volume publication Atalar Sözü published by the Kazakh Language Development Institute. As the subject, it tells the heroism of the Kazakh folk hero named Janibek, some of his adventures and his fame among the people, and also reveals the life lived in the Kazakh steppes of that period in a plain language. In this study, the translated text of the work, the transfer of the text to Turkey Turkish and its index are presented to the attention of researchers as well as those who are interested in this field.

Makale Başlığı: Persistent Stomach Pain In The young Age Patient: A Case Of Primary Gastric Burkitt's Lymphoma
Özet: Lymphoma is the second most common gastric cancer, following gastric adenocarcinoma. Most gastric lymphomas are mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas or diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Primary gastric Burkitt’s lymphoma is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and represents an aggressive and rare malignity with the fewest cases reported globally. Primary gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare condition. Burkitt’s lymphoma is an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma endemic to Africa while it is not endemic to the rest of the world. Here we presented a young immunocompetent male patient who had weight loss and was admitted with a stomachache. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy detected a large primary gastric Burkitt’s lymphoma. While long-term survival rates are possible with early diagnosis and timely appropriate treatment, delay in treatment can be fatal for such patients.

Makale Başlığı: The Current Constitutional Position of Animal Rights in the World and Türkiye
Özet: Today, the increase in cases of ill-treatment, violence, and abuse against animals has led to revising the legal regulations regarding animals and providing the protection of animals under constitutional guarantee. In this context, this study aimed to determine the constitutional rules on animal rights and protection in the world and Turkey, evaluate the debates on this subject within the framework of scientific and contemporary comparative law, and offer solution-oriented solutions suggestions. The constitutions created the study documents in force in the world and Turkey. Content analysis was performed on the documents obtained in the study through the document analysis method. Among the 193 countries in the world, it was determined that there were 49 countries with provisions on animal rights and animal protection in their constitutions. It has been seen that countries such as Germany, Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Gambia, South Sudan, India, Switzerland, Iceland, Libya, Malaysia, Mexico, Egypt, Papua New Guinea, and Slovenia include regulations regarding the rights of animals in their constitutions. In Turkey, on the other hand, it was determined that there was no direct provision regarding animal rights and animal protection in the 1982 Constitution. It can be said that there is a need for provisions protecting and guaranteeing animal rights in the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, as in modern legal systems.

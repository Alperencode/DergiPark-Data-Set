Makale Başlığı: Determination of Adaptability of Sesame (Sesamum Indicum L.) Genotypes ın Siirt Ecological Conditions
Özet: Oilseed crop sesame is mainly grown in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. Plants seeds contain 42-54% quality oil, 22-25% protein and 20-25% carbohydrates. Sesame seeds with high amounts of nutritional components are consumed as a traditional health food for its specific antioxidative activity. This crop is frequently cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions of the world.A research was carried out at in South Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey in Siirt where continental climate prevails, with the aim to select the best genotypes from a total of 23 different sesame genotypes showing high performance in terms of germination date, vegetation period, the first flowering time, the last flowering time, plant height, first branch height, number of branches, number of capsules per plant and yield. As a result of the study, significant variations were determined between genotypes for the observed parameters in the study. Plant height, first branch height, branches number, capsules number per plant, seed number per capsule were between 80,8-115,9 cm; 5,9-18,3 cm; 3,1-8,5 pieces; 65,6-154,2 pieces; 62,8-135,2 pieces, respectively. The seed yield values were lowest (38,2 kg/da) and highest (97,4 kg/da) at SUS10 and SUS1 genotypes, respectively. The differences between the genotypes might be due to the inherent genetic potential differences of the genotypes and appeared phenotype in tested  environments. As a conclusion, SUS1 genotype fit well to Siirt conditions. Branch number was negatively effected the seed yield where highest yield was obtained under lowest branch number and vice versa. As a result, it was determined that sesame species can be cropped under Siirt ecological conditions with good seed yield levels.

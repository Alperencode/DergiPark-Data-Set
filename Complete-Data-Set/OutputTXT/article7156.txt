Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Review of Assessment Tools for the Play
Özet: Play holds a great importance in children's lives as it affects the developmental parts. During the play, children take an opportunity to demonstrate and improve their developmental skills as cognitive, physical and social-emotional. For these reasons play becomes a vital subject of developmental research. In this study, it is aimed to determine the scales which are developed in Turkey or have been validated for Turkey by reliability studies and to compile descriptively the information given by these scales about the developmental parts of children. In order to do this literature search was performed using keywords such as play, traditional play, digital game, play researches, scale, play behavior, parent’s play, development areas in the ULAKBİM, Google, Google Academic and YÖKTEZ databases. Following the evaluation of studies, a total of 11 scales, 4 of which were developed in Turkey and 7 of which were adapted to Turkey, were included in the study. Even though the scales investigated similar compartments, it was observed that the sub-dimensions of the scales differ from each other depending  the cognitive, social-emotional and physical developmental parts they serve even when the scales explore similar parts. As a result, it is aimed that this review study will be a suggestion for researchers who want to do research concerning play and contribute to studies aiming to obtain information about the children's developmental compartments.

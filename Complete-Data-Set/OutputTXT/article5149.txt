Makale Başlığı: The State in Terms of Constitutionalism: A Theoretical Essay
Özet: The understanding of constitutionalism, and therefore the concept of constitution, is faced with a semantic transformation in its tension with the state. In this transformation, the constitution comes after the state. Coming after the state, the constitution may result in a deterioration in its conceptual structure. Because as such, the constitutional state may evolve into an authoritarian dimension as a result of the meaninglessness of the principles it carries, and thus the democratic state of law formula may not work. Constitutionalism refers to the limitation of state power, and therefore also of political power, by law, and the assurance of rights and freedoms in this limited environment. At this point, the constitutions demand more than this and also demand the realization of rights and freedoms by the state. This is where the constitutional-state tension arises. In this study, on the one hand, we deal with the state in the axis of constitutionalism, on the other hand, we emphasize the "constitutional state" characteristic of the state. Therefore, this study examines the constitutional-state tension with such an approach. In this direction, the conceptual framework is presented after adopting a method and understanding below. Then, the issue of the state as the subject and opposite of the constitution is examined. In this way, the activities of semantic degradation of the constitutional state are opposed and the nature of the constitutional state is brought to the agenda again in terms of semantics.

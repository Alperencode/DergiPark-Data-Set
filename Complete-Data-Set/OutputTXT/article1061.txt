Makale Başlığı: The Balkan clitic doubling and its possible Equivalent in German
Özet: One  peculiarity  of  all  Indo-European  Balkan  (Slavic  and  non-Slavic)  languages  is  object  reduplication  or  clitic  doubling.  Since  the  German  language  does  not  use  reduplication of objects, the aim of this article is to examine the possible equivalent in German to Balkan clitic doubling After researching the literature, two applicants could  be  considered  as  potential  equivalents:  the  pronoun  es  and  scrambling. There  are  two  reasons  the  pronoun  es  is  under  consideration:  (i)  the  pronoun  es  participate  in  a  kind  of  a  duplication  construction when used in so called correlate function, and (ii) reduplicated object clitics perform some functions as the expletive pronoun es does. Scrambling came to the attention because some linguists suppose that both object duplication and  scrambling  are  driven  by  the  same  information  structure  mechanisms.  This  article  shows  that  object  reduplication  clitics and the correlated pronoun es can be treated as an equivalent to each other but only peripherally, in a few specific uses. While regarding scrambling, in contrast to some linguists, it turned out that object duplication and scrambling have no  common  features  and  are  not  always  driven  by  the  same  language  mechanisms.  Scrambling,  compared  to  object  reduplication clitics, is allowed even if the object is an existential noun phrase (without an article). Furthermore, there are indications, that scrambling does not always assign the feature [-focus] as claimed and is not always driven by information structure mechanisms as object duplication does.

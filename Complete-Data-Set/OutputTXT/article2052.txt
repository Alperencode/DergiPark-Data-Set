Makale Başlığı: FINAL REPORT OF DARDANELLES COMMISSION AN ASSESSMENT ON THE GENERAL RESULT
Özet: After the Gallipoli War, Great Britain established a commission by the parliament on 12 August 1916 to investigate the cause, planning and why it was defeated in the war, based on the combined authority of the law, the king and the parliament. The Dardanelles Commission, consisting of ten people, published three reports. The first of these reports was named as Dardanelles Commission First Report and included the origin and beginning of the Dardanelles War and the Dardanelles Naval Wars. The second report was prepared as the First Report to Supplement, which is complementary to the first report. The third report, called The Final Report of the Dardanelles Commission, covered the Gallipoli landing, land wars, evacuation of Gallipoli, supply issues and the general results consisting of sixteen items during the execution of the operations. The first report and the supplementary report were published in 1917, and the final report in 1919. In the final report, a summary of sixteen items was presented under the general conclusions heading, including the other two reports. The study examines sixteen items in the general conclusions section of the final report. The aim of the study is to evaluate the issues related to the sixteen-point general conclusions published in the final report of the commission established to investigate the reasons for the defeat of the Allied Powers in the Gallipoli Campaign, by making use of domestic and foreign sources in the literature.

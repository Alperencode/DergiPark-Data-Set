Makale Başlığı: AN EVALUATİON ABOUT THE HADİTH OF “THE PROPHET'S REQUEST FROM HİS WİVES TO COVER BESİDE TO IBN UMM MAKTUM”
Özet: There have been many hadiths/words from the Prophet, which also contain some provisions about the events that took place in the family environment. The hadith, which is the subject of our research and is known to have been transmitted by Umm Salama, one of the wives of the Prophet, is one of them. Based on this hadith, the ulema made different judgments and evaluated whether a woman could look at a man or not. Here in this article, it has been tried to analyze the narration of "The Wives of the Prophet Covering Beside the Ibn Umm Maktum" transmitted by Umm Salama in terms of script and text. In the context of the research, the opinions of some muhaddis and commentators on the related hadith and various studies have been consulted to the extent possible. In addition, evaluations were made based on the verses that support the hadith we examined and some opinions about the hadiths that are stated to be contradictory.

Makale Başlığı: Exercise-based oncological rehabilitation in cancer patients
Özet: OOncological rehabilitation is aimed at improving the quality of life of cancer patients by addressing them from a biopsychosocial point of view. One of the most important aspects of oncological rehabilitation is exercise. Exercise is a non-pharmacological intervention that contributes to the improvement of pain, fatigue, quality of life, cardiopulmonary function, muscle mass and strength, and psychological state in cancer patients and cancer survivors. Exercising can be difficult in this population due to a number of physical and psychosocial obstacles caused by the disease. It is important that patients are directed to exercise by considering their needs, preferences, physical and psychological conditions. The literature states that exercise can be effective in reducing the side effects of cancer treatments. Therefore, integrating exercise-based oncological rehabilitation into the treatment pathways of modern oncology may benefit cancer patients and cancer survivors.

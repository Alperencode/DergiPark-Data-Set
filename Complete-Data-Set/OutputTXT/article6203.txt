Makale Başlığı: A STUDY ON THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATİVES IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Özet: In order to ensure sustainable economic growth and development, all existing sectors in the country need to be developed. With the industrial revolution, countries have invested heavily in the industrial sector. Especially the agricultural sector was neglected in this period.  In recent years, the agricultural sector has become more important due to the rapid increase in the population and the diversification of the demand of individuals. Investments in the agri-cultural sector have brought the concept of rural development to the fore. Rural development is the process of ensuring the economic, social and cultural development of rural communi-ties. The basis of rural development lies in eliminating the imbalance between rural and ur-ban, and solving migration and employment problems. Cooperatives play a role in ensuring rural development as they undertake tasks such as increasing employment and production in the region, revealing new job opportunities, and enabling individuals, especially women and farmers, to participate in the economy. In this study, the effect of agricultural cooperatives on rural development was examined theo-retically. In the study in which previous studies and reports were compiled, it was concluded that agricultural co-operatives positively affect rural development.

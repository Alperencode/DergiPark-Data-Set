Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF TRACE METAL CONTENTS IN MUSHROOM SAMPLES FROM AZDAVAY DISTRICT, KASTAMONU, TURKEY
Özet: Mushrooms are a popular food because they are an important source of essential amino acids, proteins and dietary fibers, but they have a great capacity to accumulate metals from substrate. Due to this reason, the content of 5 trace metals (Fe, Cr, Zn, Pb, Se) of fruit bodies of 21 fungi species originally found in Azdavay, Kastamonu Region, Turkey were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The contents of investigated trace metals in mushroom samples were found to be in the range of 4.6–3478.7 mg kg-1 for Fe, 5.1–19.9 mg kg-1 for Cr, 10.4–138.6 mg kg-1 for Zn, 5.8–28.0 mg kg-1 for Pb and 0.65–1.47 mg kg-1 for Se. The relative standard deviations (R.S.D.) were found below 10%. The accuracy of procedure was confirmed by CRMs (BCR 191 Brown bread, ERM-BD 151 Skimmed milk powder).

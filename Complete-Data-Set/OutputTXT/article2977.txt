Makale Başlığı: LIFE, WORKS AND TAFSIR STUDIES OF MULLAH HÜSNÜ GEÇER (1945-2022)
Özet: Mullah Hüsnü Geçer (1943-2022) is one of the last period eastern prominent Islamic scholars, who grew up in Eastern and South-Eastern Anatolian madrasahs. He sacrificed nearly all his eighty years of life to science. With the mystic education that he added to the religious sciences he learned in madrasahs, he never stopped to serve science and wisdom until his death. On the one hand, he taught true religious knowledge under his surveillance to hundreds of pupils who loved science; on the other hand, he continued to sermon and guidance everywhere and at every opportunity as the caliph of Nakshî, Khalidî and Haznevî sects of which he was the member. Geçer, a woeful scholar who undertook the problems and sorrows of Muslims, wished to be known as al-Hazîn. Geçer is an equipped scholar to be able to write scientific works and poems in languages such as Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic and Persian. He started writing from the early ages; and left behind more than 20 works some of which are published some are not. Some of the works he wrote are about the tafsir of Qur’an. The independent works he wrote about Qur’an are three. They are: Mevâhibu'r-Raḥmân fî Tefsîr Sûreti'l-İnsân and Mevâhibu'l-Mennân fî Tefsîr Sûreti'r-Raḥmân, which are about the surah al-İnsân and surah ar-Rahmân, respectively. These two works have been published. However, his tafsir work called Kâmûsü'l-Meânî fî Tefsîri'l-Mesânî, which he wrote from the beginning until 12th verse of surah al-Mâidah, has not been published yet. In this article, life of Mullah Hüsnü Geçer, his works and his two published tafsir works are tried to be investigated.

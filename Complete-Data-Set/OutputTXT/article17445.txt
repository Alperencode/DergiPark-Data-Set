Özet: Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in certain plant species create contamination, especially in production areas, and pose a risk to public health with the consumption of foods. Due to their sensitivity to intoxications, it has hepatotoxic, pneumotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects in all age groups, especially in infants and children. In this study, the presence and level of PAs and N-oxide compounds in oregano grown in Denizli, which has an important share in Turkey's oregano export, were investigated by LC-MS Q-TOF to determine potential public health risks. In the study, a total of 3 processed and packaged oregano samples taken from different enterprises producing oregano in Denizli and 8 unprocessed (stem) oregano samples from different regions of Denizli (11 samples ) were used as material. Identification and quantification of PAs and PANOs compounds in the samples were done by LC-MS Q-TOF. A total of 280 ±22 µg/kg of europine and europine N-oxide were determined in a processed packaged sample from the analyzed samples. According to the analysis results; PA value in oregano samples was determined below the PA limit value (<1000 µg/kg) specified in the regulation no 2020/2040/EU. It was determined that the samples did not pose a risk to public health in terms of PAs. However, the fact that no PAs was found in the processed and packaged sample in which europin was detected and in the intact oregano samples taken from the same region indicates PAs contamination caused by weed and seed pieces, albeit in trace amounts, during the processing of oregano. It is reported that the PAs limit value for plant-derived foods are specified in the Commission Regulation No 2020/2040/EU, and this value going to be 1000 µg/kg for oregano with the regulations to be made in 2022. It is thought that this study will lay the ground work for PAs regulations within the scope of the Turkish Food Codex.

Body Mass Index (BMI) was 26.66±6.27, mean age was 44.95±7.69, and 19.75±7.94 years as years of work. 43 (49.4%) of the participants stated the information about physiological sleep duration as eight hours. When asked whether they had received training on sleep disorders before, 74 people (83.1%) did not receive training, and therefore 7 (10.1%) people answered the question of sleep disorder defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) correctly. There were 42 people (47.2%) previously diagnosed with sleep disorders, and sleep apnea was the most frequently diagnosed sleep disorder in 24 (66.7%). When the level of knowledge about sleep physiology and sleep disorders was questioned, 63 (70.8%) people were found to be inadequate. Likewise, when asked whether they had sleep disorders, 42 (47.2%) answered no, and 31 (34.8%) partly answered.Conclusion: The awareness levels of the family physicians participating in the training on sleep physiology and sleep disorders were found to be quite low.

Makale Başlığı: Just Transition Approach on the Threshold of a New Era
Özet: The climate change crisis is rising against humanity in all its grandness. Although there are various global initiatives in the fight against the phenomenon, it does not seem possible to say that these practices are sufficient. The mitigation and adaptation strategies put forward in this direction should be evaluated and designed in a new perspective. The just transition approach offers a range of principles based on social justice that can be taken as a basis and acted upon within the scope of combating climate change. In the study, it is desired to draw attention to the just transition approach, which sees the fight against climate change on the basis of human rights and proposes a planning and implementation practice in this direction. It is thought that this approach can provide a unique perspective to the practices of combating climate change, which is thought to have an important place in Turkey's current and near future agenda. However, the aim of bringing the just transition, which has a circulation of about ten years in the international literature, to the Turkish literature stands out as another goal of the article.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF GASTRONOMIC EXPERIENTIAL VALUES ON REVISIT INTENTION: THE CASE OF ESKIŞEHIR
Özet: The aim of this research is to try to determine the effect of gastronomic experiential values of tourists visiting Eskişehir on their intention to revisit. In this context, the survey technique, which is one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the research. The data were collected from 399 domestic tourists visiting Eskişehir by survey technique. The collected data were subjected to demographic analysis, validity and reliability, explanatory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the analysis revealed that local tourists reach information about Eskişehir through social media, the places they visit the most are street food, local restaurants and fast food restaurants, and they prefer individual travel. Considering the findings related to the hypotheses, the effect of epistemic value, health value and price value on revisit intention was supported, but it was determined that emotional value, interaction value, taste-quality and prestige values were not supported.

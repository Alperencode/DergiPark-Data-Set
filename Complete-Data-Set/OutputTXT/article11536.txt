Makale Başlığı: The effect of some transition metal ions (Mn+2, Co+2, Fe+2) on paraoxonase enzyme activity  (E.C.3.1.8.1.) in bonito (Sarda sarda)
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of transition metal ions of manganese (Mn+2), cobalt (Co+2) and iron (Fe+2) on paraoxonase (PON) enzyme in the muscle tissue of bonito. Research is located in the north of Turkey from the Black Sea obtained 25 pieces of bonito derived from fish muscle tissue is used. Solutions of Mn, Co and Fe transition metals as MnCl2, CoCl2 and FeCl2 were prepared to be used in analysis. PON enzyme activity was determined by taking different volumes of these solutions. As a result of the obtained data, the enzyme activities of Mn+2, Co+2 and Fe+2 transition metal ions were calculated and percentage activity graphs were drawn. As a result of the research, it was determined that transition metal ions Mn+2, Co+2 and Fe+2 decreased PON enzyme activity in bonito fish. In addition, One Way Analysis of Variance (One-Way Anova) was performed to statistically demonstrate the effect of different concentrations of MnCl2, CoCl2 and FeCl2 solutions on the PON enzyme activity. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the effects of different concentrations of each solution on PON enzyme activity did not show a statistically significant difference.

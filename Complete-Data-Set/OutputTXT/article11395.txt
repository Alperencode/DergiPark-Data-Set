Makale Başlığı: Morphometric and Morphological Evaluation of the Fovea Capitis Femoris
Özet: im: This study was performed to examine morphometric and morphological characteristics of the fovea for ligament of head of femur (FLHOF) on the dry femur to determine its location and morphological types.Material and Method: FLHOF was analyzed morphometrically and morphologically on 57 dry adult femora (27 right; 30 left) and their digital images. Dimensions and surface area of the FLHOF were measured using a digital caliper on dry bone and ImageJ software on digital images.Results: The transverse length of the FLHOF (p<0.001) and surface area of the FLHOF (p=0.007) were found to be greater in the left femur bones than in the right femur bones. Type 1 localization was the most common localization type of the FLHOF. The most common morphological type was found as oval-shaped FLHOF (43.8%), followed by round (40.4%), triangular (10.5%), and piriform shape types (5.3%).Conclusion: This study indicates that FLHOF was located mostly posteroinferior quadrant and is usually oval or round in shape. Findings obtained in the present study could provide useful information in both clinical and anthropological practice.

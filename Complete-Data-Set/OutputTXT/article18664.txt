Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of Side Devices and Crosswind Flow on Aerodynamic Drag of a Ground Vehicle
Özet: In the present study, effect of side devices and crosswind flow are investigated to observe aerodynamic drag coefficient for a simplified ground vehicle (Ahmed body) since it directly effects fuel consumption. When the literature was examined, the studies that were investigated effect of slant angle, velocity and geometric modifications were presented. However, there are few studies that proposed both side device effect and crosswind flow for ground vehicles at different yaw angles. The CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) solution is performed both model with side devices and crosswind flow condition. The crosswind flow condition has been analyzed at different yaw angles (β=5°, 10°, 20°, and 30°) to observe how to affected drag coefficient. Pressure contours have been presented for model with and without side devices and under the crosswind flow conditions at rear region of body since the most of the drag force occurs flow separation or adverse pressure gradient. The streamlines velocities have been presented at x-plane which is positioned side devices location under the crosswind flow conditions. In addition, vorticity magnitude has been given for both models with and without side devices at different yaw angle. In the results of study are observed that side devices adversely effects aerodynamic performance since flow separation occurs on the side of body and it causes to increase pressure drag. The pressure drop is also observed at rear region of model due to crosswind flow condition. This causes the increase of drag forces.

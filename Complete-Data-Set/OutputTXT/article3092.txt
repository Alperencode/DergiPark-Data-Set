Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Different Rootstocks and Cultivars on Pruning Weight in Young Pear Trees
Özet: This study was carried out to evaluation of the effects on pruning weight (kg plant-1), cumulative pruning weight per plant (kg plant-1), and cumulative pruning weight per hectare (kg ha-1) of 3 quince rootstocks [Quince BA29 (BA29), Quince A (QA), Quince C (MC)] and 3 pear clonal rootstocks (Fox11, OHxF333, Farold 40) and pear seedling rootstocks grafted with 4 standard pear cultivars (‘Abate Fetel’, ‘Deveci’, ‘Santa Maria’, ‘Williams’) between 2019-2021 years. Rootstocks, cultivars, research years and their interactions significantly affected all examined parameters in the study, except for the interaction of year x rootstock x cultivar. Regarding rootstock averages, the highest pruning weight (kg plant-1) was observed from Fox 11, the lowest was in the BA29, QA, and MC quince rootstocks. Regardless of the cultivar averages, the highest pruning weight was in the ‘Deveci’, the lowest was in the ‘Santa Maria’ pear cultivar. The highest pruning weight (kg plant-1) was observed from ‘Deveci’/Fox11, and the lowest was in the ‘Williams’/QA, ‘Williams’/BA29, ‘Abate Fetel’/MC, and ‘Santa Maria’/MC combinations in terms of rootstock x cultivar interaction. The highest cumulative pruning weight per plant (kg) was determined in the ‘Deveci’/Fox11, the lowest was in the ‘Williams’/QA combination in terms of rootstock x cultivar interaction. Furthermore, the highest cumulative pruning weight per hectare (kg) was determined in the ‘Deveci’/Fox11, the lowest was in the ‘Williams’/QA, ‘Williams’/BA29, ‘Abate Fetel’/MC, ‘Santa Maria’/MC, and ‘Santa Maria’/Seedling combination in terms of rootstock x cultivar interaction. Except for the pear seedling rootstock, quince clone rootstocks generally had lower all pruning weight traits than pear clone rootstocks in the study. It can be said that the weaker development of quince rootstocks compared to pear rootstocks causes this situation. According to the results of this study carried out on young pear trees, it can be said that quince rootstocks are somewhat advantageous due to less pruning labor and cost.

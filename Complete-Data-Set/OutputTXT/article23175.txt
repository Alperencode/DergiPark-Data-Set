Makale Başlığı: Covert Operations in Counterterrorism: The Case of Mahmoud al-Mahmoud Mossad’s Targeted Killing
Özet: Since declaring its independence in 1948, Israel has attached special importance to counter-terrorism intelligence due to the threats it perceives from both domestic and foreign elements. The growing threat of terrorism has greatly influenced Israel's intelligence culture. The fear of the Third Intifada, propaganda activities that portray Israel as a criminal state in the international arena, Iran's nuclear program, rocket arsenals currently held by Hezbollah and Hamas, and cyber terror attacks deeply worry Israel. Based on the argument that Israel's intelligence community is built on convincing the aggressors not to attack, in other words, deterrence, this study seeks to answer the question of what is the role of covert operations in Israel’s fight against terrorism. In the research, the case analysis method, one of the qualitative research techniques, is preferred. In the research, in which the Mahmud el-Mabhuh case, a “targeted assassination”, is tried to be clarified, it has been spotted that the fight against terrorism is a vital issue for Israel, that it has recently followed a trend towards using covert operations more and more, in such a way that it has even managed to develop its own tactics.

Makale Başlığı: The Ineluctable Chords of Forty and Ella’s Journey from Nausea to Madhab-i-Ishq to Eudaimonia: Prismatic Effects of Elif Shafak’s The Forty Rules of Love
Özet: Elif Shafak’s novella, The Forty Rules of Love, published in March 2009, explores the identity ofone’s existence through a spiritual transformation. Sufi mysticism, which Ella has discovered, transports her onan adventurous and exotic voyage of life. In this incredibly positive tale, a sense of belonging and purpose inone’s life is instilled in the mind of the readers. A jar of Love will never be able to contain or define Love.Everything about it is limitless and brimming with Rahma (mercy). It is a narrative of a lost soul discoveringserenity in Love, exploring the meaning of life, and re-inventing why she is still living. The recompensation forevery annihilation is a cleansing of the soul, according to Sufism. Through the prism of Sufism, this paper seeksto understand Ella’s transition from Nausea to Madhab-i-Ishq to Eudaimonia and to bridge several of Tabrizi’srules with Islamic beliefs and understanding.

Makale Başlığı: Widespread Virtual Life with Blockchain, Deepfake, Avatar, Cryptocurrency, NFT and Metaverse
Özet: The idea of living in different worlds, starting with cinema, can be seen as the beginning of the virtual world. Because, although limited for a certain period of time, cinema and television, which disconnected the audience from the real world, allowed them to get away from real life and imagine different lives. Later, with the invention of the internet, the power of the computer increased and virtual life continued to be offered to users through websites and games. With the nickname feature, users are able to take their place in the v,rtual world with different identities other than their own has also started. This understanding formed the basis of the understanding of avatars. Especially with computer games, the use of avatars has increased as each user starts to create their own avatar in the virtual world. Big data was created by archiving personal data with social media, and cryptocurrencies and deepfake applications developed by making virtual life more professional with virtual reality/augmented reality were offered to users. In the research, the development of this whole process and the positive and negative effects of Metaverse, which companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Epic, Roblox, Nvidia, Unity Software, continue to design rapidly, on people and real life are emphasized.

Makale Başlığı: The Production, Agricultural Policies and Competitiveness Analysis of Foreign Trade of Edible Grain Legumes in Türkiye
Özet: This study aims to develop suggestions to increase the effectiveness of their current policies in the production and trade of edible legumes in Türkiye and reveal the competitiveness analysis and the development of agricultural support policies in the production of edible legumes in the world and Türkiye. In Türkiye, the amount of edible legumes was 1 050 thousand tons in 2021, which consist of 45.22% chickpeas, 29.03% beans, 21.70% red lentils, 3.33% green lentils, 0.72% bean, pea, and cowpea. In 2020, the foreign trade surplus of edible legumes occurred at approximately 38 million dollars. Balassa’s Revealed Comparative Advantage Index (RCA) was used in the competitiveness analysis. The competitiveness index average was calculated as 4.41 and, hence; it was determined that Türkiye has a high comparative advantage in the export of edible legumes. The agricultural support policy began in 1941 with the purchase of edible legumes from the Turkish Grain Board (TMO) and continued until the Economic Stability Decisions of 1994 with the Fallow Narrowing Project (NAD) in 1982. They are the main policy tools that TMO’s food legumes product purchases, which started again in 2018 after 24 years, in the production of edible legumes, diesel and fertilizer support started in 2005, premium support started in 2008, certified seed use/production support started in 2009. It is determined that effective and timely support policies in Türkiye increase production, while it decreases in the periods when the effectiveness of the support policies decreases and is removed from the application untimely.

Makale Başlığı: THE REPORT OF THE GREEK BISHOP HRISANF OF NEOPATRAS ON THE TURKS AND THE PEOPLES NEIGHBORING THEM
Özet: This study contains the Turkish edition of the Russian report- preserved in the Russian State Central Archive in Moscow- of the Greek Bishop of Neopatras named Hrisnaf, who, for the Russian Empire, compiled the intelligence information he obtained during his trip to the Ottoman lands, Turkestan Khanates, Iran, Georgia, Afghanistan, India, and Tibet, as an agent in the last years of the eighteenth century. In addition to addressing the close political relations between the Ottoman Empire and the Emîrate of Bukhara, Hrisnaf's report provides military-strategic information related to Anatolia and Syria. Besides, there are interesting deductions about how to act militarily in the attempt of possible seizure of Turkish provinces such as Erzurum and Trabzon by Russia as well as some predictions about the loyalty of Armenians to the Ottoman State. Apart from these, the reasons for the enmity between Iran and Georgia are examined and the necessary prerequisites for the expansion of the Russian Empire in the Caucasus are mentioned. The political, economic, and statistical information given about the Bukhara Emîrate and Khiva Khanate, which Russia has not yet conquered, is undoubtedly important in terms of whetting the appetite of the colonial mentality of the Russian ruling circles in St. Petersburg. Finally, issues related to the socio-economic structures of Afghanistan, India and Tibet, about which little is known in eighteenth century Russia, are discussed.

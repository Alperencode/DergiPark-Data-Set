Makale Başlığı: Geomorphology of the Lower Catchment of Ayvalıtohma Stream
Özet: Ayvalıtohma Stream Basin is the sub-basin of Tohma Stream, which is one of the western branches of the Euphrates River. The geomorphological features of the study area between Darende- Hekimhan (Malatya) Gürün and Kangal (Sivas) were determined within the framework of field studies and geomorphological analyzes on synthetic surfaces. The study area generally consists of plateaus between Uzunyayla Plateau and Malatya Basin and deeply disssected by streams. The narrow and is deeply gorge and canyon valleys opened by Ayvalıtohma Stream connect Uzunyayla, Ayvalı-Kuluncak, Darende-Balaban depressions. These gorges and canyons, which are typically seen around Gürun, Darende, Kuluncak and buried in the karstic foundation, played an important role in the formation of the flood plains along the Ayvalıtohma Stream. The Ayvalı-Kuluncak Depression, which forms the center of the study area, has the characteristics of an intermountain basin developed in the Oligocene. Detrital deposits such as conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone, which were deposited in the Oligocene and had low erosion resistance, revealed the areas that suffered the most erosion in the basin. While these non-resistance rocks cause erosion, the thick limestones in the mountainous and plateau areas have led to the development of relatively macro karst forms, especially between the elevation of 1700-2100 m.

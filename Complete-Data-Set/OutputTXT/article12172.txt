Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Overlay Coating Applications on High Temperature and Solid Particle Erosion Wear
Özet: Two different metallic coating processes (NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlY) were applied on Inconel 718 substrates using Atmospheric Plasma Spray and High-Speed Oxy Fuel Spray methods. Energy conversion plants, gas turbines, jet engine blades, etc. It was aimed to simulate exposure to particle impact under high temperature in applications. At the end of the coating process, four sample groups with different properties were deposited. Solid particle erosion wear behavior of these samples under ambient conditions and temperature were investigated. A specially designed test rig that can perform solid particle erosion wear tests under high temperature conditions was used in the experiments. In the experiments, 300°C was preferred as the air temperature. Assuming that the particles impacting the surface may have variable direction, three different erosive particle impingement angles were selected as 30°, 60° and 90°. In addition to these experimental parameters, particle impact velocity of ~97 m/s using the double disk method and Al2O3 erosive with a size of ~400 µm were determined. As a result of the experiments, the comparative erosion rate graphs of the test samples coated with two different methods were obtained and the results were interpreted by using the SEM, XRD and EDX elemental analyses. In addition, the details of the porosity values of the coatings, hardness and surface roughness measurements of the test specimens were also included in the results of erosion resistance

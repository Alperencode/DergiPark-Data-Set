Makale Başlığı: Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical treatment of inguinal hernia: A retrospective study
Özet: Aim: In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number, complication rates and epidemic characteristics of patients operated with the diagnosis of inguinal hernia in our institute.Methods: We analyzed all patients who underwent inguinal hernia operation in Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Dept of General Surgery, between March 11, 2019, and March 11, 2020, and compared them with the cases between March 11, 2020, and March 11, 2021, retrospectively. Percentages, mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range were used as the descriptive statistics. Mann-Whitney U test was used for the variations which are contrary to the normal distribution range in the comparison of two groups. The relations between qualitative variations were studied by the Pearson Chi-Square test and Fisher's Exact test. Significant value was determined as 0.05 for all statistical analyses.Results: Between March 11, 2019, and 2020, 65 patients were operated on (Group 1), and 26 patients between March 11, 2020, and 2021 (Group 2). The percentage of female patients was significantly higher in Group 2 (4.6% in Group 1, 23.1% in Group 2, p=0.008) and there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of incarceration and strangulation in Group 2 (44.6% in Group 1, 84.6% in Group 2, p=0.001).Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic the incarceration and strangulation rate was higher. The increase in complication rates can be attributed to the relative decrease in elective surgeries or the increase in the number of female patients admitted during the COVID period.

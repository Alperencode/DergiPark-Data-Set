Makale Başlığı: Edible Insects in Nutritional and Food Technology Perspective
Özet: While the global population is estimated to reach 9 billion by 2050, alternative food sources that utilise less natural resources and do not contribute the level of carbon emissions are needed to meet the increasing quality protein demand. In this respect, it is believed that insect production on the farm will be a safer and more sustainable source of protein compared to traditional animal agriculture. Although edible insects vary according to their species in terms of nutrition, they attract attention as an alternative food source due to their high fat, protein, vitamin, mineral, and fiber contents. In particular, they are considered to have the potential to offer solutions that can meet the increasing demand for protein in the future. The presence of raw protein varies among the species, e.g. more than a hundred edible insect species' have between 20- 70% protein content. The use of edible insects and the nutrients to be harvested from them to form alternative food recipies makes it necessary to accept new (novel) food concepts and risk assessments. This study aimed to reveal edible insects in nutritional and food sciences perspectives by using a comprehensive literature review.

Makale Başlığı: The relationship of some heat parameters of the soil with the maximum soil temperature
Özet: Change of soil properties, creation of optimum soil environment for plant growth, explanation of soil formation processes etc. It is related to the maximum temperature in the soil and it is necessary to determine the maximum temperature in the soil theoretically and experimentally. In this study, the applicability of the analytical expression of the maximum soil temperature obtained from the solution of the thermal conductivity equation of the soil was investigated. Theoretically, it has been shown that the maximum soil temperature is a function of the average temperature of the soil depth, the amount of heat passing through a unit area, mass density, specific heat capacity, and depth. The maximum temperatures measured and calculated at 0-50 cm depth of the soil are in the ranges of 16.6-35.8°C and 16.4-38.4°C, respectively; the amount of heat passing through the unit area is in the range of 3.716•106-17.857•106 J m-2; the specific heat capacity was determined as 950.404 J kg-1 °C-1. The correlation between the measured and calculated maximum soil temperatures was found to be high (R2=0.9106). Also, the relative error is in the range of 0.012-0.148; mean relative error was determined as 0.086.

Makale Başlığı: SMART CITY AS AN ECOSYSTEM OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP: WHAT OPEN INNOVATION MEANS FOR CITIES
Özet: The urbanization growth is pressing cities to meet the growing demands of the city dwellers. As urban population is expected to be 68.4% of the total population as of 2050, cities have started to address this challenge using Information Communication Technologies to optimize their current physical infrastructure. This notion is called smart cities and it is more than using the technology; because city governments’ efforts alone are not enough to keep up with the pace of ever-increasing issues. Therefore, being a smart city also requires an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset and collaboration of all the stakeholders in the city. In this paper, I propose a smart city definition, examine how open innovation model can be applied to smart cities and how this model can be governed by the city management. I believe that this will be a starting point for academicians who aims to deepen the research in open innovation and for practitioners who wants to apply the model.

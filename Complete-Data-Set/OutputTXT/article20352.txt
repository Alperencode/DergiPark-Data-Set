Makale Başlığı: WOMEN'S E-COMPULSIVE BUYING BEHAVIORS IN TURKEY DURING THE PANDEMIC
Özet: With the development of globalization and technology, it is seen that consumption is increasing rapidly. With the increasing online consumption and the effect of the COVID-19 epidemic, there are some differences in consumer behavior. One of these behaviors is compulsive buying behavior that individuals have difficulty in controlling and perform as a result of an impulse. Compulsive buying behavior is becoming a threat to individuals and families in today's societies. Considering all of these together with the relevant literature review, the aim of this study is to determine the differences in e-compulsive buying behaviors of women living in Turkey during the pandemic process in the context of demographic factors. In the research, convenience sampling method, which is one of the non-random sampling methods, was used and the online survey method was applied. In the study; there is a 7-item e-compulsive buying scale adapted by Türkyılmaz, Kocamaz, and Uslu (2016). As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that working women do more e-compulsive shopping than non-working women in terms of e-compulsive buying behaviors. On the other hand, it is observed that e-compulsive buying behaviors of female consumers differ in terms of monthly income. It has been determined that there is no difference in e-compulsive buying behaviors in terms of women's marital status, whether they have children, their age, education level and residential areas.

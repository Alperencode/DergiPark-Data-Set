Makale Başlığı: Development Of A Serıous Leısure Actıvıty Satısfactıon Scale
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to develop a high scale of psychometric qualities of individuals aimed at revealing serious leisure activity satisfaction. For this purpose, validity and reliability studies were conducted in a rational and statistical context. Within the scope of validity, scope and structure validity based on expert evaluations based on a rational approach, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity and divergent validity analyses and structure validity studies were carried out statistically. Cronbach's alpha and combinatorics reliability determination techniques were used in reliability analysis. When deciding on the factor structure, the eigenvalues and slope slope graph were used and a 5 factor 31 item scale explaining 54% of the total variance was obtained. In the model tested on a completely independent group from the group to which DFA and AFA are applied, it is statistically significant that the standardized values of the substances in the model dec between 0.46 and 0.89; it has been concluded that the compliance indices of the tested measurement model are within acceptable criteria. the values of AVE for convergent validity calculated with DFA findings in a 5 factor structure, MSV and ASV for divergent validity support the validity of the scale, while the Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient supports the validity of the scale .87, and the combinatorics reliability coefficient (CR) was obtained above 0.7 in all sub-dimensions. These findings showed that” Serious Leisure Activity Satisfaction Scale " provides the conditions of validity and reliability.

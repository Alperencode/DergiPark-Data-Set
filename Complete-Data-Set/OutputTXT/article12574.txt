Makale Başlığı: Optimal Timing for Ovarian Sliding Hernia Repair in an Infant
Özet: Objective: Ovarian sliding hernia is usually operated on emergently or early. Recently, elective surgery has been recommended. However, the ideal time for surgery has not been clarified. The study aims to determine the ideal surgery timing for an infant's ovarian sliding hernias.Materials and Methods: The data of non-reducible inguinal hernia in female infants revived who were operated on at our clinic between 2011 and 2021.  The data of ovarian sliding hernias were evaluated for age, clinical findings and surgical outcomes.Results: Of the 76 non-reducible inguinal hernias, 85.5% (n = 65) were found to have sliding hernias of the ovary. The age range of ovarian sliding hernias were 0–3 months 76.9% (n = 50), 3–6 months 23.1% (n = 15) and 6-12 months %0 (n=0). No ovarian torsion was detected in the age group 0-3 months, ovarian torsion was detected in one patient in age group 3–6 months, who also complained of restlessness, swelling in the groin, and tenderness.Conclusion: Although ovarian sliding hernia is more common in 0–3 months, ovarian torsion was not detected in any patient in this period. Surgery for ovarian sliding hernia should be delayed until three months of age.

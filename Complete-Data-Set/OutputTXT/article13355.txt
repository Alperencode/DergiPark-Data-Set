Makale Başlığı: News translation in the scope of the four-function model
Özet: The number of researches regarding news translation in the field of translation studies had been increased remarkably in the past few years. In this sense, focusing on the news disseminated by multilingual news agencies to the readership originated from different cultures has a paramount importance. In this article, our starting point will be the concept of “translation of information” used by Roberto A. Valdéon (2009) for informative texts. Based on this concept, examples of migration themed news disseminated by Euronews in French and Turkish will be analyzed in the scope of Christiane Nord’s “Four Function Model”. Firstly, in order to define the function of the news text, a lexical and semantic analysis will be applied to the news headings. In the second step, supportive elements related to the defined function will be selected and examined. The purpose of our two-fold analysis is to determine the functional and semantic changes applied to the same news texts in the process of news dissemination to two different cultures. In this article it is shown that in multilingual news agencies, news is being prepared by taking into consideration different perspectives and it is a reader-oriented process. In this process it has been observed that news creates a meaningful whole and the information transfer is realized with the holistic contribution of lexicons, sayings and expressions that establish different lexical and semantic relations.

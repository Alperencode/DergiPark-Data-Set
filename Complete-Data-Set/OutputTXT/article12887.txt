The Gray Entropy method was used to calculate the weight scores of the evaluation criteria used in the study, and the COPRAS method was used to determine the performance scores of the companies in question and to rank them in this direction. Findings from the Gray Entropy method revealed that the criterion with the highest impact on performance for all years in the period in question was the Return on Equity Ratio. BNP Paribas Insurance Company was the company with the best performance in the aforementioned period, according to the performance ranking obtained using the COPRAS method.

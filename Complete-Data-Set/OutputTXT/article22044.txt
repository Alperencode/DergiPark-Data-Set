Makale Başlığı: TRANSFORMING VEGETABLE WASTES INTO BIOPLASTICS: AN ENVIROMENTALLY FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVE FOR DESIGN AND ART WORKS
Özet: In this experimental study, bioplastic structures were obtained by using vegetable wastes with a sustainable eco-friendly approach. The properties of the structures obtained by using vegetable wastes, which rarely exist in the literature, in different ways were examined.  Surfaces with different colour, handle, appearance and textures were generated by using natural wastes such as almond husk, olive pomace, onion (purple & yellow) skin, lemon pulp and peel, banana peel (pulp and fiber reinforced), tangerine peel (pulp and fiber reinforced), pomegranate peel (pulp and fiber reinforced), orange peel (pulp and juice), watermelon peel, radish peel, cucumber peel, tomato peel, lettuce, beetroot stalks, purple cabbage, avocado seed, artichoke leaves. It has been observed that these structures, which various forms can be given, have potential to design of different products and some art works beside textile and fashion design in an unique, creative and innovative way.

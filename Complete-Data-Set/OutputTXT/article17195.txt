Makale Başlığı: DETERMINANTS OF IMPULSIVE BUYING BEHAVIOUR AND A MODEL PROPOSAL
Özet: Impulsive buying is a sudden, unplanned purchase that the consumer makes without thinking about the consequences. Impulsive buying has become an important economic phenomenon due to the availability of credit cards, the existence of online shopping options, and the spread of shopping mall culture. This study investigates the effects of social media, hedonic consumption and conscientiousness on the impulsive buying behaviour of consumers in the city of Ankara, Turkey.  Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 784 customers in 14 shopping centers. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to validate the proposed model. The results showed significant relationship between the factors social media, hedonic consumption, conscientiousness and impulsive buying.  It is also found that the customers making shopping list have less impulsive buying than those who do not have shopping list, and also women are more impulsive buyer than men.

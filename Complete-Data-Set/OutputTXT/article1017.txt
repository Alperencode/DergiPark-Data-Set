The purpose of this article is to examine the evolution and trends of consumer behaviour research during the Covid-19 pandemic period. The publications written on the subject of “covid” from the WoS database with the words “consumer behaviour” or “consumer behavior” in their titles were scanned in the business and management category, limiting the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. A total of 642 accessed publications were subjected to bibliometric analysis using the CiteSpace 6 program. The findings show that the number of studies in this field has increased. According to country collaboration analysis, there is a strong country collaboration network between the USA, China, India, Australia, South Korea and the UK. The most studied topic clusters are green consumer behaviour, consumer engagement behaviour and effective service quality. The three most used keywords are impact, consumer behaviour, and model. The study is important as it reveals the trend of consumer behaviour publications during the Covid-19 pandemic period. It is expected that the findings of the study will guide the consumer behaviour researches.

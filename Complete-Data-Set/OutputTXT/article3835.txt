Makale Başlığı: KUŞADASI DISTRICT IN HURÛFÂT REGISTRIES (1045/1636-1250/1835)
Özet: The Hurûfât Registries (Hurûfât Defterleri), which are kept in the Archives of the Foundations General Directorate (Ankara Vakıflar Genel Müdürlüğü), have recently started to receive the necessary attention due to their importance in various disciplines. The information obtained from the Hurûfat Registers can be truly informative in art history studies and can contribute in various ways. Based on this understanding, we aimed to obtain new information about the cultural assets of Kuşadası from the Hurûfât Registries of Kuşadası. The Registries that we transcribed from Ottoman Turkish to today's Turkish contain the names of neighbourhoods, villages, mosques, masjids, madrasas, fountains, officials and foundations in the 17th, (mostly) 18th and 19th centuries. The Registries include names of constructions that do not exist today. It is obvious that the information obtained will make significant contributions to revealing the historical texture of the city and its culture.

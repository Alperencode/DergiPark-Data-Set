Makale Başlığı: SOME THOUGHTS ON THE SURFACE CLEANING OF TERRACOTA CULTURAL ASSETS FROM  UNDERWATER EXCAVATIONS
Özet: When the start of underwater archaeological excavations in Turkey, the number of underwater artefacts that came to our museums and were preserved is quite high. In addition, the number of underwater remains caught in fishing nets, plucked from their context and removed to warehouses without any conservation work is undeniable. Especially the warehouses and displays of our museums, which are on the coast, contain hundreds of underwater archaeological artefacts. Terracotta objects recovered from underwater for various reasons will suffer irreversible losses if the necessary desalination procedures are not applied before they are stored in museum warehouses. At the same time, these remains are seriously damaged and information are lost when underwater creatures adhere to the surfaces of amphorae and similar terracotta objects and create new accommodation areas. These marine formations must be cleared of their residual surface and existing information must not be hidden under the shells.

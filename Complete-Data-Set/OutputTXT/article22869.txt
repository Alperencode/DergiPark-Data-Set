Makale Başlığı: Clothing Terms In The Divan Of Bursalı İbrahim Râzî
Özet: Divan literature continued its existence from the 13th century to the 19th century and included numerous poems and poets. It gradually lost its power with the TanzimatPeriod. Tanzimat artists criticized divan poetry a lot. The foremost of these is that divan literature was written in an abstract world disconnected from social life. This study will try to reveal how wrong this criticism is. Divan literature cannot be considered independent of social life. Almost everything about Ottoman society has been the subject of divan literature. The content of social life is quite rich. In this context, our study covers clothes, which is a sub-branch of social life. Clothing is a necessity that has existed since the history of humanity. Clothing, which was just a necessity in the beginning, developed and became an indicator of status from time to time, and sometimes a part of fashion, and became industrialized over time. Clothing, which is one of the factors that make up the culture in Ottoman society, was also the subject of their poems by divan poets. In the study, the clothing terms mentioned in the Divan of Bursalı İbrahim Râzî, who lived between the 18th and 19th centuries, were tried to be determined and to be explained how these terms were used in the divan.

Makale Başlığı: Solitary fibrous tumours, should they always considered to be benign gigantic masses?
Özet: Background:Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are rare seen tumorsassessed to be originated from pleura. Even though they are benign, after theircomplete resections malignant recurrences might be seen in follow up period. Inthis study, based on our case series undergone complete surgical resection dueto SFT, we looked for an answer whether if it is convenient to accept these tumorsas benign or not.Materialsand Methods: Patients undergone surgery between January 2000 and January2011 were included in this study. Follow up data, patients and tumorhistopathological characteristics were analysed. Results:Our series consisted of 14 cases (eight male, six female) with a mean age of49.5 ± 15.3 (15-70 years). All patients’ undergone thoracotomy, and completeresection was performed. The mean follow-up was 50.3 ± 30.6 months (between 9 -101months). Two recurrences were detected and both patients died due to recurrentdisease. Conclusions:Though they are considered to be benign lesions, SFThave a potential to come along with malignant recurrences.  Recurrences were observed in gianttumors and this makes us think if it is possible to overlook a malignant focusin histopathological observation in such kind of big tumors. In thissense, patients should be informed in this regard and a complete and wideresection should be performed as much as possible with a long time follow upperiod as malignant diseases.

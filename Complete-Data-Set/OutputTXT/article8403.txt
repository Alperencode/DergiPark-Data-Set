Makale Başlığı: The Disputes Between Sibawayh and Abu'l-Hasan al-Ahfesh in the Frame of Ibn Hisham's work named Mughni al-Labib 'an Kutubi'l-E'arib
Özet: Ibn Hisham has brought an important source to the field of Islamic sciences by transferring the knowledge he gained as a result of a long education life to his epistle called al-İʿrâb ʿan kavâʿidi'l-iʿrâb. The work, which was copyrighted in the field of syntax, was appreciated by many scholars by coming to the forefront in terms of the issues it contains and the way it handles the subjects. Thus, the author wrote a work called Mughni al-Labib based on the classification and method of this treatise. In this work, Ibn Hisham touches on the conflicts between linguists in order to provide detailed information about some issues related to the literature. The main subject of our study is the conflicts between the related linguists Sibawayh and Abu'l-Hasan al-Ahfesh. Conflicts between Sibawayh and Ahfesh are shaped within the framework of issues such as: حاشا is verb and letter, ك is noun and letter, كَيفَ comes as adverb or noun, the words عسى and لولا are used as pronouns, ف comes in the form of zaide in a sentence, لا whichs is in the form of müfred and the iʿrâb of some words. While Ibn Hisham sometimes does not make any evaluations on the above-mentioned issues, he sometimes chooses between Sibawayh and Ahfesh. Linguists such as Abu Ali Qutrub and Abu Amr al-Cirmi were subject to Ahfesh in almost all of the conflicts between Sibawayh and Ahfesh. However, although rarely, Sibawayh's view is preferred to Ahfeş's view on some issues.

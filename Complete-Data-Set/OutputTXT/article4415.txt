Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of Pedagogical Knowledge and Skill Levels of Physical Education Teachers
Özet: This study aims to analyze the pedagogical knowledge and skills of physical education teachers. The study group of this research, which was designed in a descriptive general survey model, consists of 600 physical education teachers who have voluntarily participated in the research. The data of the research were collected online with “Personal Information Form” and “Pedagogical Knowledge and Skills Scale”. It has been determined as a result of the research that the pedagogical knowledge and skill levels of physical education teachers are generally high and teachers exhibit pedagogical knowledge and skills mostly in the dimensions of "Student Learning" and at least in the dimension of "Teaching Support". It has been concluded that pedagogical knowledge and skill levels of physical education teachers by demographic variables significantly differ in favor of male teachers in the sub-dimensions of “Student Learning” and “Importance and Care”; in favor of the teachers working in secondary schools in the sub-dimensions of "Student Learning", “Course Planning”, “Teaching Support” and “Adaptation to Diversity”; in favor of the teachers with a bachelor’s degree in the sub-dimensions of “Student Learning” and “Adaptation to Diversity”; however, pedagogical knowledge and skill levels do not differ significantly by the professional seniority. According to the results of the research, it has been suggested that the groups related to demographic variables should be kept close to each other, the research should be renewed on a larger sample and qualitative studies related to the research subject should be included.

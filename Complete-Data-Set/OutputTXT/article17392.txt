Makale Başlığı: THE RIGHT OF THE CHILD TO BE FORGOTTEN AGAINST THE VIOLATION OF THE CHILD'S PERSONALITY RIGHT ON SOCIAL MEDIA
Özet: The sharing of sounds, pictures and images of children, mostly by their parents, on social media, including the period when children are incapable, creates an indelible footprint in the digital environment for children. The development of the child who is exposed to likes, comments and evaluations in the virtual environment is negatively affected. Sharing about the child on social media causes a violation of the child's privacy, dignity and dignity, and the right to protect their personal data. The right to be forgotten, which forms the basis of these rights, is a right that the child also has and can demand, and is not included in a separate and special legal regulation as a concept. However, there are regulations that have the same purpose and basis as the right to be forgotten, both in our Constitution and in our legal legislation. The child's exercise of the right to be forgotten ensures that the sharing that causes the violation is deleted or removed from the internet page, in case of violations of rights against the child in social media. Within the scope of this study, it is aimed to find out how the child can use his right to be forgotten within the framework of legal legislation and to develop solutions in this regard.

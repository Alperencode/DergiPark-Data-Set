Makale Başlığı: A COMPACT 2-WAY MULTISECTION POWER DIVIDER for BROADBAND OPERATIONS
Özet: This paper represents a broadband 2-ways Wilkinson power divider for S-band (2-4 GHz), C-band (4-8 GHz) and X-bands (8-12 GHz) applications. The broadband design is proposed by dint of a multisection Wilkinson power divider topology with utilizing the microstrip technology on a single layer printed circuit board. The proposed design has a 7-sections to achieve an operating frequency bandwidth of 2-12 GHz. The surface mount resistors are utilized in the design to enhance the isolation between the output ports. In addition, a prototype of the proposed design is manufactured on a Rogers 4003C and the 0402 package surface mount resistors are soldered between the output ports of each section. The prototype has input reflection coefficient better than -15 dB, -20 dB and -10 dB, respectively in the S-, C-, X-bands. Moreover, the prototype has output reflection coefficients better -17 dB, -20 dB and -10 dB, respectively in the S-, C- and X-bands. The measured insertion loss is less than -5 dB. Furthermore, the isolation between the output ports is better than -10 dB, -17 dB and -15 dB, respectively in the S-, C- and X-bands. Furthermore, the total phase variation between the output ports are less than 1.8° in the frequency range from 2 to 12 GHz. The prototyped multisection 2-way power divider illustrates a broadband characteristic with better phase imbalance and the measurement and simulation results are close to each other. The total size of the prototype is 4x41 mm2.

Makale Başlığı: Antioxidant and prooxidant properties of selected herbs and Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau (bergamot) used for the management of hyperlipidemia
Özet: Background and Aims: In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the search for herbs to aid the management of hyperlipidemia. There is currently very little data on the simultaneous evaluation of the antioxidant and prooxidant properties of antihyperlipidemic herbs. This study was designed to evaluate the antioxidant and prooxidant properties of four antihyper- lipidemic herbal drugs and also of bergamot.Methods: Antioxidant property was determined by ferric ions (Fe3+) reducing capacity (IRC), DPPH radical scavenging ac- tivity (DPPH IC50) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC); deoxyribose degradation test was used for prooxidant property.Results: The highest total phenolic content (TPC) was in the myrtle leaf (ML)(135.35±3.46 mg GAE/g, p<0.05) whereas the highest total flavonoid content (TFC) was in green tea (GT) (48.76±0.69 mg QE/g, p<0.05) both of which were main- tained from a pharmacy. Among the bergamot samples, the highest TPC and TFC values were in filtered fruit juice (BFFJ) as 197.35±6.29 mg GAE/100 mL; and 94.14±1.39 mg QE/100 mL; p<0.05, respectively. GT showed the highest antioxidant capac- ity in IRC and TEAC assays (2.29±0.12 mM TE/g; and 2.32±0.07 mmol TE/mg, p<0.05). The lowest DPPH IC50 was identified in ML from a pharmacy (6.95±0.08 µg/mL; p<0.01). BFFJ had the highest IRC (2.94±0.031 mM TE/10µL), TEAC (5.14±0.084 mmol TE/10 µL) and the lowest DPPH IC50 value (10.561±0.17 µL). GT from a pharmacy and 1mg/mL concentration BFLFJ (fil- tered and lyophilized) were associated with the lowest hydroxyl radical scavenger activity (0.171±0.013 µM MDA equivalent, p<0.05 and 0.144±0.015 µM MDA equivalent, p<0.05).Conclusion: BFLFJ and GT got the highest attention due to high TPC, TFC, antioxidant and low prooxidant properties. Our results highlight the necessity of clarifying the value of bergamot and GT in this field with further studies.

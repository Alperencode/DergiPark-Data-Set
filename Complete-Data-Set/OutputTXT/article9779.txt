Makale Başlığı: Guarantee Practices and Risk Management Modalities of the Turkish Transit System: the Tobbund Case
Özet: Customs transit is essential to customs regimes as it plays a transitional role between export and import, thereby enabling the movement of goods from one place to another. For goods subjected to international transportation under export or import regimes that are not yet cleared by customs, the relevant authorities may check for a customs guarantee. Therefore, it is essential to urgently establish a sustainable and manageable infrastructure for reliable guarantee execution and effective risk analysis. This case study uniquely exemplifies how TOBBUND has created an effective guarantee management system with proactive risk analysis methods. It also gives important insights into other transit guarantee management systems.

Makale Başlığı: Hidirlik Tower
Özet: The Hıdırlık Tower, built in the 2nd century, with a square bottom and a cylindrical tower at the top, Antalya are on the city walls. The tower, which is thought to have been built by the Roman Emperor Hadriyanus, was used as a lighthouse and watchtower for ships coming to the bay. There is a small room on the lower floor of the tower, and a walking area around a rather thick wall mass on the upper floor. The remains of the frescoes on the room walls on the lower floor have been lost for centuries due to water leaks, so in some sources, the tower is shown as a hero's tomb.

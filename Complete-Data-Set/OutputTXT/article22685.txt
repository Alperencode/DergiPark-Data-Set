Makale Başlığı: BREAST CANCER SCREENING AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS
Özet: It is estimated that approximately 22 million people will be diagnosed with cancer annually by 2030, due to the increase in environmental triggers and the stressful pace of daily life. As predicted, the increase in newly diagnosed cancer cases means an increase of % 75 when compared to 2008 cancer registries. This increase in a disease such as cancer, which makes the lives of individuals psychologically, socially and economically difficult, is a serious problem. Undoubtedly, the most valuable strategies for cancer today will be to develop early diagnosis and prevention methods. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and can be diagnosed at an early stage. In this sense, early diagnosis, which is one of the important components of preventive health services provided in primary care in our country, has an important place in breast cancer. Basically, our aim to detect breast cancer early is to prolong the life of the individual, as well as to reduce morbidities and ensure a quality life.

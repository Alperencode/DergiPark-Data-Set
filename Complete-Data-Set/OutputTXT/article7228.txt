Makale Başlığı: Waste Assessment and Construction Management of Floor Covering and Formwork Constructions
Özet: Dissonance between the dimensions of the location and the dimensions of the used material, irregularities of the location, existence of the structural and architectural elements such as column, doorsill, installation shaft, and any distortions which causes irregularity may cause increase in the material waste during the floor covering or formwork activities. Construction process is executed under limited time and severe stress, therefore determination of the placement pattern and material cutting strategies providing the minimum material waste are ignored. This situation coincidentally may cause excessive material wastes and increase in the workmanship. In this study a methodology, providing the placement pattern and the most suitable material dimensions to obtain minimum material waste is developed. A hypothetical construction project is used as a case study problem and the required material and the cutting of material amounts are computed. The developed method minimizes the material waste by detecting the most appropriate placement pattern and the material dimensions among the tested ones. The utilization of the developed method can decrease the construction costs by reducing the amounts of material waste and the workmanship. Consequently the contractors will be able to utilize the effective cost control technique, Kaizen Costing method, by designing more efficient buildings.

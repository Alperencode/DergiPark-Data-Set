Makale Başlığı: The relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet, coronavirus anxiety, and cognitive status in university students
Özet: Objective: To determine the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, Coronavirus Anxiety, and Cognitive Status in University Students. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 385 university students. A sociodemographic form, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale Short Form (CAS), and Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMBS) were used. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate potential predictors of adherence to MD and coronavirus anxiety and psychological well-being. Results: The 19.5% of the sample resulted at high risk of depression (WEMWBS score<40) and the 14.0% at high risk of psychological distress (WEMWBS score 41-45). The median MEDAS score was 6 for men (IQR = 4) and 7 for female (IQR=2) in a range between 0 and 14 (the higher score, the higher is the adhesion) (p = 0.001). The MEDAS score of 7-9 points was associated with a lower risk of depression (p=0.027). Only 12.2% of sample had coronavirus anxiety. The main variable that had a positive correlation with WEMWBS was CAS (r=-0.132; p=0.001). Conclusions: Coronavirus anxiety was not common among students. Adherence to the MD and good mental health seem to be related in a sample of university students. And those with the lowest risk of depression. The potential protective role that MD has for mental health in university students could be used to help developing more comprehensive intervention strategies of health promotion among young people.

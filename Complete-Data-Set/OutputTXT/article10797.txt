Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE THEATRICALLY-DISTRIBUTED DOMESTIC DOCUMENTARIES IN TURKEY (2003-2017)
Özet: Over the recent years, the exhibition of films in Turkey has been problematic in some ways. Especially, the visibility of certain films has been observed to be poor because the stakeholders who own the majority of the market have created obstacles in distribution of these films. As seen as a kind of non-demand genre, documentaries have found few opportunities to be displayed on screen. This study takes a look at the released documentaries of Turkey from 2003 until 2017 and tries to investigate the motivations behind their distribution and perception. Content analysis is used for presenting the contextual dynamics that might have affected the release of the documentaries. The screening journey of the films is also investigated as the data allows. The related information about the directors is provided in order to disclose possible reasons that encourage decision makers to screen the film. Other types of information about the films such as competing in the festivals, lawsuits, and critical or public perception are mentioned as well. Several implications are offered to overcome the problematic aspect of documentary’s visibility that might enlarge the problem of freedom of speech.

Özet: Aim: In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the views of midwifery students studying at the Faculty of Health Sciences on anatomy education. Materials and Methods: 294 of 328 individuals, consisting of students from XXXX University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Midwifery Department, participated in the research. In order to evaluate the anatomy education, the students were asked a questionnaire consisting of a total of 26 questions, 3 of which were open-ended and 23 of which were closed-ended. The obtained data were analyzed by transferring them to the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 22 package program. Results: The average age of the students participating in the study was 20.71 ± 1.88, and 76.9% of these students stated that they chose the midwifery department willingly. 64.3% of the students participating in the study stated that anatomy education should be given between 10:20-12:00; stated that 75.5% of the anatomy education exam should be "multiple choice", 12.2% "short answer", 10.2% "classical written" and 2% "oral". In the study, a total of 67 students, 11 of whom graduated from health vocational high school and 56 of whom graduated from Anatolian high school, reported that they had difficulty in learning anatomy (p<0.05). It was determined that the success average of the anatomy education midterm-final exam of the students who graduated from the health vocational high school was higher than the other high schools (p<0.05). Conclusion: Student feedback is very valuable in increasing the quality of anatomy education. It is thought that rearranging the anatomy education lesson plan and content in line with the feedback received from the students will contribute to the better quality learning of human anatomy by midwifery students who undertake important tasks for the mother and baby.

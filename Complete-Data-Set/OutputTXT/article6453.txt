Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Reaction, Vertical Jump, Speed, and Agility in Regional Amateur Football League Players
Özet: This study aimed to discover the relationship between countermovement jump, squat jump, visual reaction, sprints (10m, 30m) and agility (zig-zag test) parameters in amateur soccer league players players. Twenty-eight male soccer players of age(years) 24.14±4.29, standing height (cm) 180.86±5.59, body weight (kg) 76.07±7.31, body fat ratio (%) 15.45±4.16 and body mass index (kg/m2) 23.31±3.01 from a soccer team in Regional Amateur League participated in this study. Statistical analysis of the data obtained were carried out by Pearson Correlation Test as the data was parametric. According to the results, highly positive significant correlation was found between counter movement jump and squat jump (p <0.01). No statistically significant relationship was found among other parameters (p>0.05). As a result; Vertical jump parameter is independent of reaction time, sprint and agility parameters in football players playing in the Regional Amateur League. In order to improve reaction time, vertical jump, sprint, and agility performance levels of the soccer players in this league, it is recommended that athletic performance coaches and sports scientists working in these leagues design their training plans, being aware of this situation.

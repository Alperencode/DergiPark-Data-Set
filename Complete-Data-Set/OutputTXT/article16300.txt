Makale Başlığı: Revisiting the Conditions of the Populist Radical Right Electoral Success in CEE during Europeanization period: A Fuzzy-set Approach
Özet: The Populist Radical Right parties (PRR) in Central and East European countries (CEECs) are skeptical about supporting the European Union membership. In the 1990s seldom did the PRR electoral success occur in CEECs that engaged into the fourth enlargement of the European Union during the first decade of the new millennium. Then, the PRR received more votes. Applying a new methodological approach based on fuzzy-set analysis, this study revisits under which context the PRR achieved electoral success in the period from 2000 to 2010. This study concludes: first, right wing mainstream parties’ positive stance on the issue of EU-membership benefitted the PRR in parliamentary elections held during the period 2000 to 2010. Second, the presence of a notable Roma population was context-setting condition: the policy divergence between right-wing mainstream party and the PRR, along with the unemployment problem (unlike the corruption problem) helped the latter, if a notable Roma population exists (e.g. Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia). In countries without a significant number of Roma populations (e.g. Poland and Slovenia), the PRR electoral success occurred when the right wing mainstream parties pursued socially illiberal policies despite its support for the EU membership.

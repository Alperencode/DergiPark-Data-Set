Makale Başlığı: SIMULATION OF AFRICAN PRINT FABRICS USING SCREEN PRINTING TECHNIQUE IN THE TEXTILE DESIGN STUDIO.
Özet: African print is the textile term used to describe machine printed wax print designs on fabrics. These fabrics are commonly referred to as Ankara fabrics. They are valuable items in the African textile market because they have high economic value. This study focused on the simulation of African print fabrics in the textile studio using screen printing technique. The study adopted practice-led research design in the textile studio. Five (5) African print fabric designs were created using CorelDraw graphic design suite. CorelDraw graphic suite was used because of its flexibility for colour separation. The materials used are screen printing mesh, textile ink, fabrics, squeegee and exposure unit among others. The study established the possibility of producing novel African print fabrics without the need for heavy machines. It was therefore recommended that textile designers should engage in studio production of African print fabrics. This will enhance the production of original and novel African print fabric designs that are readily available to the end users.

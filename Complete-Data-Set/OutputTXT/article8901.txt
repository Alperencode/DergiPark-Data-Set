Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Organic Mulch Materials on Weed Control in Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) Cultivation
Özet: This study was carried out in Iğdır University Şehit Bülent Yurtseven Campus to investigate the effects of different mulch materials on weed control, cucumber yield and soil temperature and moisture in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivation in 2020 and 2021. Five mulch materials (Linen cover, peat, chopped paper, straw and fresh clipping grass) were used in the study. Temperature and humidity data loggers were used in the study. The research was established in a randomized complete block design with 7 characters and 4 replications. In the both years of the study, the effects of mulch applications on weed dry weights and cucumber yield and some yield components were determined. As a result of the study, a total of 12 weed species belonging to 7 families were determined in the trial area. Accordingly, the effects of mulching on weed dry weight and cucumber yield were significant for both years (p<0.01). The findings of the current study revealed that the effects of mulch applications on weed control, the lowest weed dry weights in both years were in Linen (0.00 g/m2) mulch plots that control weeds 100%, the highest weed dry weights were in weed control parcels in the first year were 285,25 g/m2 and 248,14 g/m2 in the second year. Also, the highest cucumber yield was obtained as 4.685 kg/da in the first year and 4.520 kg/da in the second year in both years in the linen plots, whilst the lowest cucumber yield was obtained in weed control plots in both years.  Considering temperature and humidity, the highest values were noted in linen covered plots.

Makale Başlığı: Optimization of Antioxidant Activity and Phytochemical Properties of Dried Pepper Samples (Capsicum annuum L.) by Using Response Surface Methodology
Özet: The optimization of methanol extraction was performed to maximize antioxidant activity and phytochemical properties of dried pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) samples by using the surface response method (RSM) in this study. Box Behnken design model was used to investigate the influences of three independent variables, extraction temperature (25-60ºC), extraction time (30-60 min), and dried pepper concentration (500-1000 mg/20 mL). The effect of the dried pepper concentration variable on all the responses was statistically significant, except reducing capacity data. DPPH radical scavenging, reducing capacity, and metal chelating activity increased with rising extraction temperature and dried pepper concentration variables. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) yields were also observed to enhance with an increase in dried pepper concentration. TPC and TFC in samples ranged from 2.32 to 3.92 mg GAE/g and 0.063 to 0.210 mg RE/g. The highest antioxidant potential for all employed tests was recorded in 2 experimental runs (25°C, 45 min. and 1000 mg/20 mL). The coefficients of determination (R2) for antioxidant analysis were determined as 0.9235-0.9238. These values for TPC and TFC were 0.9364-0.9925, respectively.

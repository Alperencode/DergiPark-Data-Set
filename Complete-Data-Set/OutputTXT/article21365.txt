Makale Başlığı: Development of a spiramycin sensor based on adsorptive stripping linear sweep voltammetry and its application for the determination of spiramycin in chicken egg samples
Özet: Herein, an adsorptive stripping linear sweep voltammetric technique was described to determine spiramycin, a macrolide antibiotic, using a carboxylic multiwalled glassy carbon electrode modified with carbon nanotubes. The main principle of the analytical methodology proposed was based on the preconcentration of spiramycin by open-circuit accumulation of the macrolide onto the modified electrode surface. As a result of the adsorption affinity of spiramycin to the modified surface, the sensitivity of the glassy carbon electrode was significantly increased for the determination of spiramycin. The electrochemical behavior of spiramycin was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and the irreversible anodic peak observed was measured as an analytical signal in the methodology. The proposed electrochemical sensing platform was quite linear in the range of 0.100–40.0 μM of spiramycin concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0.9993. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 0.028 and 0.094 μM, respectively. The intra- and interday repeatability of the proposed sensor was within acceptable limits. Finally, the applicability of the electrochemical methodology was examined by determining the drug content of chicken egg samples spiked with spiramycin standard. A rapid and easy extraction technique was performed to extract spiked spiramycin from the egg samples. The extraction technique followed had good recovery values between 85.3 ± 4.0% and 93.4 ± 1.9%.

Makale Başlığı: Cloning and Expression of the Bacterial Lipase Gene in Pichia pastoris and Purification of the Recombinant Enzyme
Özet: In the food industry, enzymes are biological catalysts that find application area in all kinds of processing and production processes. Lipases are one of the enzymes that are widely needed in various fields of the food industry, from milk processing to fruit juice production, from meat processing to bread production. In this study, the gene encoding codon optimized Geobacillus stearothermophilus lipase was expressed using the pPICZA expression vector containing the AOX1 promoter, which is a strong and inducible promoter in the Pichia pastoris expression system, and the clone exhibiting the highest lipase enzyme production was determined. Production was carried out with the determined clone in 400 mL induction medium for 72 hours and the enzyme activity, total protein and SDS-PAGE analyzes were performed in the collected supernatant sample. The recombinant lipase enzyme was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on the samples taken from each step of the purification process and the purification efficiency was calculated in the samples obtained at each step. In the sample analyzed after purification, it was determined that the clone with the highest production reached the lipase production level of 25.02 mg L-1.

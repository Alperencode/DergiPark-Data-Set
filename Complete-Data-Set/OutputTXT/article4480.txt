Makale Başlığı: 17-year-old Selective Mutism Case without Treatment for A Long Time
Özet: Selective mutism is a rare childhood anxiety disorder characterized by the inability to speak in certain social situations in which speech is expected, despite speaking fluently in other situations. The average age of onset for selective mutism is 2 to 5 years old, but symptoms may not be noticed until starting school. The cause is still not known and the prevalence varies between 0.03% and 1%. Psychopharmacology and psychotherapeutic approaches are recommended in the treatment. Although the treatment is difficult, early diagnosis is one of the good prognostic factors. In this case report, we aimed to discuss the psychiatric and sociocultural functionality of a 17-year-old adolescent with selective mutism. Our case is remarkable as she has not been treated for many years. Her treatment continues with psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Recognition of selective mutism and getting support on this issue will help to solve the problem.

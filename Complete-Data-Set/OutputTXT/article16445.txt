Makale Başlığı: Relationship of Context Features and Familiarity Effect with Perception of Time in Young Adults
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the effect of familiarity effect, the number of stimuli in the context, and the number of replays on time perception. In the research, there are videos with two context features, in which the number of stimuli is low and the number of stimuli is high. To test the data, 2 (familiarity: familiar, unfamiliar) x 2 (context: few stimuli, more stimuli) x 3 (video replays: 1, 2, 3 times) Three-Way Factorial Repetitive Analysis of Variance was applied. The findings show that individuals’ perceived time to watch videos again expands. The low number of stimuli in the context affected the perception of time faster than when the number of stimuli in the context was high. According to the findings of the Chi-Square analysis on how time passes according to the context, time is perceived to be more stable in an environment where the number of stimuli is low compared to an environment where the number of stimuli is high.

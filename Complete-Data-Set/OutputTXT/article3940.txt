Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Yield and Yield Parameters for Advanced Bread Wheat Lines
Özet: The selection of genotypes suitable for the purpose determined in breeding studies is important for the healthy conduct of the study. At this point, it is essential to characterize the population created. In the study, the morphological characteristics of some advanced bread wheat lines under field conditions were investigated. Plant height (46.73-67.20 cm), spike length (6.47-9.08 cm), number of spikelets per spike (15.20-18.67 pieces/spike), number of grains per spike (27.00-53.43 pieces/spike), grain weight per spike (1.11-1.82 g), thousand grain weight (30.02-42.88 g) and grain yield (134.58-346.33 kg/da) were determined in the study which was carried out in three replications according to the randomized blocks experimental design with two control varieties of 18 bread wheat lines. As a result of the study, it was determined that there are genotypes that stand out especially in terms of ear structure, and DZT-11 and DZT-17 lines are ideal genotypes in terms of ear characteristics and DZT-4 line is the ideal genotypes in terms of highest grain yield.

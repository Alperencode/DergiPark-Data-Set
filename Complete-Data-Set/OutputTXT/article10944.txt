Makale Başlığı: THE ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN PEACE-BUILDING  IN CYPRUS: LESSONS FROM UNDP AND UNFICYP
Özet: The Cyprus conflict constitutes one of the protracted conflicts that remains unresolved at the global level, with the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities having remained separated for more than 50 years. Both domestic and international actors such as the United Nations (UN) have put efforts into rebuilding peace among these two communities. The major UN entities in Cyprus include the UNFICYP, the Office of the Special Advisor for the Secretary General (OSASG), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These have together worked in collaboration with the two communities to build and maintain peace in Cyprus. Within this context, the purpose of this article is to address, using the example of Cyprus, the role played by the UN bodies on the island as an international actor in re/constructing peace in post-conflict societies by referring to civic engagement, gender equality and sustainable development.

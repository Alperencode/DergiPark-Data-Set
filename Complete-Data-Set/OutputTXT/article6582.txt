Makale Başlığı: Impulsivity and Aggression as a Predictor of Smartphone Addiction in University Students
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine to what extent impulsivity and aggression variables predict smartphone addiction levels of university students. The research group consisted of a total of 531 students, 257 (% 48.4)  male and 274 (%51.6)  female, studying at Afyon Kocatepe University in the 2020-2021 academic year. “Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Form”, “Short Form of Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11-SF)”, “Kar-Ya Aggression Scale” and “Personal Information Form” were used as data collection tools. Multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise) method was used in the analysis of the data obtained from the research. In the study, it was determined that there was a significant positive correlation between smartphone addiction and impulsivity and aggression (Smartphone addiction and impulsivity (r=.482, p<.01); smartphone addiction and aggression (r=.435, p<.01)). It was found that the variables of impulsivity and aggression were significant predictors of smartphone addiction. Impulsivity and aggression variables together explained 29% of smartphone addiction. From the research, it was concluded that university students' smartphone addiction was significantly predicted by "impulsivity" in the first place and "aggression" in the second place.

Makale Başlığı: Association of systemic immune-inflammation index with long-term all-cause mortality in pancreatic cancer patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy
Özet: Aim: Systemic immune-inflammation (SII) index may provide more promising prognostic information in patients with cancer surgery. However, to the best of our knowledge, the prognostic value of SII index in patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy has not been studied. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate and compare the prognostic value of SII index in patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy.Materials and Methods: All patients over 18 years-old that underwent successful pancreaticoduodenectomy due to pancreatic cancer between February 20, 2019 and June 30, 2021 at Ankara City Hospital Department of General Surgery were included. The main predictor of interest was SII index which was measured by neutrophil*platelet / lymphocyte count. The main outcome of the study was long-term all-cause mortality.Results: A total of 223 patients were included in the current study. Multivariable cox regression analysis revealed that history of congestive heart failure [HR (95%CI): 3.682 (1.140-11.892)], and SII index [HR (95%CI): 1.001 (1.001-1.001)] were independently associated with all cause long-term mortality. The accuracy of predicting mortality for SII index was assessed by the area under the ROC curve which was = 0.77. A higher value of 1305 of SII index was found with 76% sensitivity and 67% specificity for predicting all-cause long-term mortality.Conclusions: The results of the study suggest that measurement of the SII index, an easily available and relatively cheap marker, is an independent predictor of long-term survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

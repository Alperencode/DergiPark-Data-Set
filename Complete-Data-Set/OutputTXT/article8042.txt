Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Urban Quality Regarding Disadvantaged Groups
Özet: The key indicator for the successful design of a healthy environment is that individuals living in the city can access public spaces and services, especially the disadvantaged, the elderly, children, pregnant women, disabled, baby carriages. In this study, the relationship of disadvantaged groups with the urban environment is grouped under three main headings. In the context of Urban Environment Quality and Comfort, in order to facilitate the adaptation of individuals to the urban environment, it is necessary to provide an environment with a convenient housing design, where their mobility is supported, compatible with the topography, safe, daily needs are met within walking distance. Within the framework of Public Transportation and Access, accessibility to all types of public spaces should be ensured by public transportation that are affordable, easy to use, safe and multiple options. Neighborhood and Social Relations, on the other hand, are possible if individuals live in an urban environment where participation in society and social activities is encouraged, and where they can see themselves as a part of the society. As a result, these factors can be accepted as the main keys to the active participation and integration of disadvantaged groups in social life.

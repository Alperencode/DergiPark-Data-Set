Makale Başlığı: The Effect Of Trade In Turkey Within The Scope Of Inward Processing Regime On Import Dependence
Özet: In Turkey, an inward processing regime system is applied in order to promote exports. This system applies tax exemption to intermediate goods imported for export. Despite its export-promoting effect, it is argued in the relevant literature that it has some problems. These problems can be summarized as dependency on imports, increasing current account deficit and budget deficit. The aim of this study is to examine whether the inward processing regime causes the problems listed in Turkey. In the study, Turkey's import dependency is compared to the G7 countries and it is concluded that it is relatively low to the G7 countries. It is noteworthy that Germany's import dependency is more than Turkey's. The inward processing regime implemented in Turkey does not increase its dependence on imports, current account deficit and budget deficit.

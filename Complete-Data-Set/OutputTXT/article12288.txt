Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Whitening Toothpastes on the Color Change of the Discolored Composite Material
Özet: Aim: In present study, it was aimed to examine in vitro color changes on the composite resin surfaces as a result of brushing the dental resin composite with 5 different whitening toothpastes for 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.Material and Methods: In this study, 50 disc-shaped composites were prepared. The samples were randomly divided into 5 groups to use 5 different whitening toothpastes.  The initial colors of the samples were measured and recorded with a spectrophotometer. Composite discs were kept in colorant solution (Nescafe) for 6 hours. After the prepared samples were removed from the solution, they were washed and color measurements were made again. Brushing process was applied to the composite discs in the brushing simulator. ANOVA, Bonferroni test, Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney-U test were used for data analysis.Results: It was found that toothpastes with whitening effect had a positive effect on the discoloration on the surface. There was no significant difference in all 5 groups when the initial color values were compared with the color values after 1, 3 and 6 months of brushing (p>0.05). Conclusion: It can be recommended to use toothpastes with a whitening effect to extend the service life of commonly used composite resins and to remove the discoloration on the surface.

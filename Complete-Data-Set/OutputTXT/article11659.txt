Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Limberg Flaps and Karydakis Flaps in The Treatment of Pilonidal Sinus Disease: A Single Physician Experience
Özet: Objective: Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that impacts quality of life. Many conservative and surgical approaches for treating PSD have been described, but the best surgical method is still up for debate. Our aim is to see whether there is a difference between Limberg flap (LF) and Karydakis flap (KF) procedures in patients with (PSD).Methods: The study was designed retrospectively. Our research includes a comparison of two patient groups who had PSD surgery performed by a single physician between March 2016 and October 2020. The patients who underwent LF proceure were determined as Group 1, and the patients who underwent KF as Group 2 and the clinical and practical differences between these two techniques were analyzed.Results: The mean age, duration of surgery and hospitalization were shorter in Group 2 (p=0.019, p=0.0001, p=0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the remaining variables.Conclusion: There was no significant difference between LF and KF procedures in terms of quality of life, recurrence and complications. However, the fact that KF procedure can be completed in a shorter time and patients can be discharged earlier makes this group one step ahead.

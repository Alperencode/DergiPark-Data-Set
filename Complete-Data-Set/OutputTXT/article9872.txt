Makale Başlığı: TURKISH EDUCATIONAL HISTORY IN THE NATIONAL STRUGGLE PERIOD (1920-1923)
Özet: Of course, education could not be prioritized in the period between 1920 and 1923, when the struggle for life and death was fought. Despite this, Mustafa Kemal personally followed the education-teaching activities and tried to create a national and contemporary education system. The aim of this study is to reveal the organizational process of the National Education between the years 1920-1923, which is accepted as the early republican period, the general structure of the Turkish education system and the work of the Ministers of National Education in a systematic and holistic manner. This study is important in terms of revealing the educational policies and activities implemented between 1920-1923.In this study, descriptive survey, one of the qualitative research methods, was used. In the analysis of the data, the document analysis technique was used. In this study, primarily the Turkish Grand National Assembly's Minutes, copyright and examination works were used. As a result of the study, it was determined that four Ministers of National Education served in the period between 1920-1923. In addition, important activities in the field of education such as the establishment of the Ministry of Education, the convening of the Maarif congress, the publication of the Misak-ı Maarif and the gathering of the First Committee of Education between the years 1920-1923. It is seen that these activities formed the basis of the innovations related to education that took place after the proclamation of the republic.

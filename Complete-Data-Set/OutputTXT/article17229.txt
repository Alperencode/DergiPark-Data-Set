Makale Başlığı: Unity between the Qur'an and the Sunnah
Özet: The Qur’an and Sunnah are the pillars of Sharia, and this meansthat there must be unity between the Qur’an and the Sunnah andthere is a relationship between them and a percentage ofcoherence and consistency. Thus, neither there can be adisagreement between them nor they can be dispensed with eachother. This study aims to emphasize harmony and consistency inthe relationship between the Qur’an and Sunnah and hence it ispossible to respond to intellectual suspicions that want toexclude Sunnah from the Qur’an.

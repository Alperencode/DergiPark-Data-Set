Makale Başlığı: SELECTION AND TRAINING OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN SINGAPORE, SOUTH KOREA, FINLAND AND TURKEY
Özet: Discussions on the selection and training of school administrators have been going on for a long time. In order to create an effective school administrator selection and training approach in our country, it is important to see alternatives by examining the school administrator training systems of countries that have achieved significant success in international exams in terms of making new arrangements. In this study, similarities and differences of the school administrator training systems between Turkey and Singapore, South Korea, Finland  were revealed. In this study, Singapore's comprehensive practices in the school administrator selection process, the long-term teaching experience that South Korea expects from candidates and the mandatory master's degree education in Finland given before serving as a school administrator were implementations that attract attention. In addition to pre-service training of administrator, it was seen that importance is given to in-service training and the continuous development of school administrators. While there was no compulsory pre-service training for school administrators in Turkey until the regulation change made in 2021, with the recent changes, candidates were required to obtain an pre-service education management certificate. Although the latest regulation is an important step in the process of educating administrator, it is considered a mandatory need to make new regulations for choosing and training school administrator in Turkey.

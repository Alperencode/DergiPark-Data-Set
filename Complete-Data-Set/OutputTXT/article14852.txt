Makale Başlığı: Ability, Motivation, Opportunity-oriented HR Practices, Organisational Citizenship Behaviour and Performance Outcomes Relationship in Project-based Construction Organisations
Özet: The purpose of this study is to contribute to the project management literature by testing a model that combines ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO) oriented human resource management practices, organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) and performance outcomes in project-based construction organisations. The data were collected from questionnaires completed by 320 construction site civil engineers operating in the Marmara region of Turkey. The findings of the study indicate that there are positive relationships between AMO-oriented human resource practices and performance outcomes; however, organisational citizenship behaviour does not mediate these relationships.

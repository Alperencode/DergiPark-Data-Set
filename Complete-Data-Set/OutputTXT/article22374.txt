Makale Başlığı: Release kinetics of 3D printed oral solid dosage forms: An overview
Özet: Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is one of the most extensively researched methods for producing nano/micro scale biomaterials. This method is typically applied layer by layer. The 3DP method has many advantages over traditional manufacturing methods and ensures that personalized drug design is feasible. Individual dose adjustment provides significant benefits, particularly in some disadvantaged patient groups. Individual release characteristics may be required in these patient groups in addition to dose adjustment. 3DP technology also allows for the adjustment of release kinetics. All of these factors were also increasing interest in 3DP technology in the pharmaceutical industry. The goal of this review is to understand the pharmacological significance of 3DP technology as well as the parameters influencing the release profiles in tablets produced by using technique, and to establish a correlation between them. Within the scope of this review, 79 literature research studies were examined, and it was determined that there is limited data to determine whether there is a correlation between release kinetics and 3DP techniques. When the release profiles obtained by considering the polymer type used in these techniques are evaluated, immediate and rapid release was obtained in studies using PVA + PLA polymers and studies using PVP polymer, immediate release in studies using Kollidon® and Kollicoat® derivatives, and controlled, extended and sustained release was observed in studies using PCL polymer.

Makale Başlığı: The Principle of Constitutional Supremacy in 1924 Constitution: Ineffective Borders
Özet: The basic principle that dominated the making of 1924 Constitution was the principle of parliamentary supremacy, which was also adopted during the years of the national struggle. At the same time, the principle of constitutional supremacy was also included in article 103 of the constitution. With this article, it has been stated that no article of the constitution can be prevented from functioning and no law can be unconstitutional. The constituent power that made the constitution did not authorize the judicial organs to review the constitutional supremacy, and accepted that this issue be reviewed by the political organs. However, the political review model adopted by the constituent power did not have a conducive structure for effective constitutional review. As a result of the inability of the principle of constitutional supremacy to be connected to an effective review mechanism in this way, 1924 Constitution had lack of the ability to limit the state power. In this study, it has been tried to show that 1924 Constitution did not dopt the judicial review model for the constitutional review of laws and the adopted political review model was not an effective review model. In addition, the effect of this situation on the quality of 1924 Constitution was also examined.

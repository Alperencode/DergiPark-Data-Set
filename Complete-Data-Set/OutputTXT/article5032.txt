Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the effectiveness of vesical imaging-reporting and data system (VI-RADS) scoring in predicting muscle invasion of bladder cancer
Özet: Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the accuracy of the “Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System” (VI-RADS) scoring system in predicting preoperative muscle invasion of bladder cancer.Material and Methods: Patients with bladder cancer who underwent pre-operative mp-MRI between August 2020 and March 2022 were included in the study. Bladder tumors were evaluated by an experienced uroradiologist using the VI-RADS scoring system. The VI-RADS score was compared with postoperative pathology to determine muscle invasion. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPD), negative predictive value (NPD), and accuracy were calculated for the VI-RADS ≥3 and VI-RADS ≥4 cut-off points.Results: Benign pathology (cystitis cystica in three patients, nephrogenic adenoma in one patient) was found in four of 102 patients. The remaining 98 patients were included in the study. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer was detected in 38 patients and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in 60 patients. When the threshold value of the VI-RADS score was taken as 3 in determining muscle invasion, sensitivity, specificity, PPD, NPD value and accuracy were calculated as 92%, 85%, 94%, 80% and 88%, respectively. However, when the threshold value of the VI-RADS score was taken as 4, sensitivity, specificity, PPD, NPD value and accuracy were found to be 82%, 95%, 89%, 91% and 90%, respectively.Conclusion: In conclusion, bladder mp-MRI is a successful method in the detection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer with a VI-RADS threshold value of 3 or 4, accompanied by VI-RADS criteria, and may increase the diagnostic performance.

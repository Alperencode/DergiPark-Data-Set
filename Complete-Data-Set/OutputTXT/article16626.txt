Makale Başlığı: A NEW CONCEPT FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN ART EDUCATION: A/R/TOGRAPHY
Özet: This article attempts to explore how the A/r/tographic model, which is one of the art-based research practices, can be used effectively in terms of students and teachers in the learning-teaching environment. The study also aims to lead researchers to new creative teaching methods where the A/r/tography method is used rather than traditional teaching methods, thereby engaging students in active learning and encouraging them to be research minded and ask questions.  The academic focus has been placed on A/r/tography as an alternative practice-based research, and relatedly scientfic articles  have been produced. Adopting a student-centered approach, A/r/tography, as an ever evolving methodology, is unique and authentic since it traces rapidly changing phenomenon and learning activities. Irwin, one of the Canadian educational researchers who first worked on A/r/tography, is one of the pioneers who introduced this new concept to the literature. Following the initial research on A/r/tography, researchers in most countries, particularly in Canada, who were curious about this new art-based method, intended to incorporate A/r/tography into many branches of science and education. A/r/tography-based research, which is still a new concept and method in our country, attracts researchers’ attention. It is thus believed that the use of A/r/tography method will allow fine arts students to  live up to their true potential. A/r/tography is expected to be utilized in several fields of education as well as art education when it is properly understood by experts and employed as an educational method. Therefore, it is thought that students and teachers will be able to complete their creativity and competence processes at the desired level, or even exceed expectations, and thus develop unique products. This seems possible only by reviewing the alternative learning-teaching systems, teacher and student training programs in our country from a contemporary perspective.

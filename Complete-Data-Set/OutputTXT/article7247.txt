Makale Başlığı: Utilization Potential of Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as Silage
Özet: This research was carried out in 2020 to determine the silage quality of 5 different switchgrass (Alamo, Cave in Rock, Cloud Nine, Kanlow and Shawnee) grown in Bingol University Agricultural Research and Application Area. The plants were harvested 10-15 days after the flowering period, the fragmented plant samples were filled into plastic drums and left to fermentation for 45 days at room temperature. In silage materials; physical score, dry matter ratio, pH, acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), crude protein (CP), digestible dry matter (DRM) ratio, dry matter intake (DMI) ratio, relative feed value (RFV), acetic acid (AA), butyric acid (BA), lactic acid (LA) and propionic acid (PA) contents were examined. According to the results of the research, it was found statistically significant at the p≤0.01 level among the switchgrass cultivars in all of the examined characteristics. Accordingly, the varieties; between 7-11 points in terms of physical score, 40.21-47.21% dry matter rate, 4.32-4.59% pH value, 40.72-49.67% ADF rate, 55.65-63.65% NDF rate, ADL rate 12.50-15.07%, crude protein rate 4.82%-8.42%, digestible dry matter rate 50.20-57.17%, dry matter intake rate 1.90-2.17%, relative feed value 73.35-95.57, AA ratio 0.70-1.38%, BA ratio 0.02-0.29%, LA ratio 1.00-1.86% and PA ratio between 0.012-0.034% detected. According to the data obtained from this research, it was determined that the best quality silage could be obtained from Cloud Nine cultivar in switchgrass.

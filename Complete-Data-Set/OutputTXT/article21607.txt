Makale Başlığı: Metaverse and A Swot Analysis of Turkish Health System
Özet: The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of Metaverse on health services and the situation of Turkey's health system against Metaverse with SWOT analysis from a holistic perspective. In the study, keywords determined from Google Academy, EBSCO, ULAKBİM, Science Direct, Scopus and SOBİAD databases were searched. In the study in which secondary data were used, the data were evaluated with the SWOT analysis technique. It has been seen that the Turkish health system has advantages such as the presence of a young population, not being far behind the developments, and the experience of Covid-19. However, it has been found that the existing inequality in access to health services will deepen, virtual dependence will increase and related health problems will become widespread. As a result, it is predicted that Metaverse will have positive and negative effects on health services in many ways.

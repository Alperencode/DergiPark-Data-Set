Makale Başlığı: SPEAKING MANNER IN THE WORDS OF MINSTRELS
Özet: The rules of good manners based on respect and courtesy; includes the behaviour patterns expected from people in many situations in the daily flow of life, such as sitting, getting up, hosting guests, going to condolences, getting on the elevator, talking on the phone.  One of these rules is the one about speaking.  Speaking manner is one of the most important good manner rules.  Because communication between people is mostly provided by means of speech.  Therefore, knowing what, where, how and how much to talk is very necessary for healthy communication.  For this reason, our society is trying to teach the younger generations the manners of speaking informally, just as it teaches the other rules of good manners.  It is seen that the minstrels also take responsibility in terms of teaching speaking manners in this informal process. The data obtained in this study, in which document analysis, one of the qualitative research methods, was used, was classified by subjecting descriptive analysis. When the minstrel style poetry tradition, which has a strong instructive quality, is examined from this perspective, it is seen that the minstrels handle the manners of speaking in a way that can be classified under the headings such as speaking less, appropriate and in a thoughtful manner, speaking decently, not talking nonsense, not prolonging the conversation, not gossiping, not praising oneself, and not revealing secrets and contribute to this education process.

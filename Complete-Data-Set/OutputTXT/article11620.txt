The sample of the study consisted of 1184 students who volunteered to participate in the study and filled out the forms completely. Data were collected using the socio-demographic data form and the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale developed by Chen and Starosta.Results: 78.9% of the participants were nursing students, 21.1% were midwifery students, and 75.7% were women. The rate of those living in the Mediterranean region was 83.3%, the rate of those living in the city center was 58.8%, and the rate of those who evaluated their economic status as medium was calculated as 69.4%. It was determined that the total mean score of the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale of the students participating in the study was 88.79±14.28. When the mean scores of the sub-dimensions of the scale are examined, the mean score of "responsibility in interaction" is 26.11±4.94, the mean score of "respecting cultural differences" is 23.32±4.37, the mean score of "self-confidence in interaction is 17.06±3.57, the mean score of "enjoying interaction" is 11.13±2.29 and " It was determined that the mean score of “being careful in interaction” was 11.18±2.29. When the scale scores of the students were examined according to the socio-demographic data, it was found that the total scores of intercultural sensitivity of midwifery students, female students, those who lived in villages for a long time, and those who went abroad were statistically significantly higher (p≤0.05). It was determined that the students' age, class, economic situation, geographical region where they grew up, receiving intercultural training in midwifery and nursing, serving patients from different cultures, and choosing the profession willingly did not affect the level of intercultural sensitivity.Conclusion: It was determined that the students participating in the study had a moderate level of intercultural sensitivity according to the scale evaluation.

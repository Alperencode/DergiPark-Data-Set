Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of Nato’s Kosovo Operation and Operation Active Endeavour From The Perspective of Armed Conflict and The Prohibition of Use of Force
Özet: According to Article 2(3) of the United Nations Charter, it is stated that all kinds of problems, including border disputes, that arisebetween states should be resolved by peaceful means. However, wheninternational relations are considered, if the interests of the states arein question, there is no such thing as not using force or completelyavoiding war, and often states have resorted to using force. But Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter prohibits the use of force ininternational relations and the threat of using force. This situationbrings along the sovereign equality of states, the obligation of statesnot to interfere in each other's internal affairs, and the right of statesto be independent in their own internal affairs. In the light of relevantinformation, in this research, the concepts of armed conflict and war,as well as the concept of prohibition of the use of force, are examined.Within the framework of the aforementioned concepts, the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Kosovo and Operations ActiveEndeavour were evaluated in this research.

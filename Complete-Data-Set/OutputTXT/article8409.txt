Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Study of Turkish and Ladino Literatures: Nasreddin Hodja and Djoha Stories
Özet: Thousands of Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and took refuge in the Ottoman Empire. With the migration from the west to the east of the Mediterranean Sea, these Sephardic Jews brought their Iberian culture and language, later called Ladino, to the Ottoman lands along with their oral and written works of literature. There is no doubt that Djoha is a comic figure who has an important place in the oral tradition of Ladino literature. The stories of Djoha were told and transmitted in the same geography, namely Anatolia, under the name of Nasreddin Hodja. The thematic analyses showed similarities between the stories of Nasreddin Hodja ve Djoha in terms of word games, proverbs, sayings, religion, education, multiculturalism, time, space, gastronomy, architecture, monarchy, animals, and sexuality. The comparative study on Pertev Naili Boratav's Nasreddin Hodja and Matilda Koen-Sarano's Djoha Ke Dize? also pointed at the transformation of Nasreddin Hodja in Djoha stories.

Makale Başlığı: Analysing American singer Katy Perry’s song “Chained to the Rhytm” with its video in terms of the indicators
Özet: Universe, which can be regarded as a unity of indicators, consists of countless indicators that are simple or complicated, concrete or abstract. Indicator, which is explained as a unit associating something although it is not that thing, has the quality of substituting for the thing that it represents. Indicator, which appears in every part of life, is the basis of both visual and verbal communication. While scientifically studying the indicators refers to “semiology”, rising interaction among the works leads to “intersemiotics”. In the rapidly globalizing world, with the developing technology, new media emerge. Besides, in the hybrid atmosphere caused by postmodernism, various disciplines interact with each other. In such an atmosphere, the interaction of media and literature is inevitable. No matter on which sequence of indicators, communication is carried out via media. In this regard, music videos that are the products of visual-audial media include different indicators referring to many things. In this context, American singer Katy Perry’s fifth album, Witness’ hit song, “Chained to the Rhytm”, with its lyrics and video, is embeded with lots of indicators referring to various events and people. In this study focusing on lyrics and video of “Chained to the Rhytm”, it is aimed to reveal the indicators that are included and comment on them.

Makale Başlığı: Integrating Commercial-off-the-Shelf Games into Language Classroom: PCaRD Experience of Two English Language Teachers
Özet: This study aims to investigate two English language teachers’ perspectives on adopting a game-enhanced language learning intervention that was designed according to the PCaRD framework. For this purpose, a semi-structured interview protocol and researcher memos were utilized as data collection tools, and the data were subjected to thematic analysis. The results of the study indicated that the game-enhanced activities integrated into the curriculum were effective in promoting students’ foreign language learning and instrumental in helping students develop a more positive self-image about their foreign language abilities. Despite the time cost of preparing the activities bridging the commercial-off-the-shelf games into the existing curriculum and applying them in class and concerns about the negative connotation of video games, the PCaRD framework provides essential guidelines that teachers will find helpful for enhancing their students’ learning experiences and motivation for learning.

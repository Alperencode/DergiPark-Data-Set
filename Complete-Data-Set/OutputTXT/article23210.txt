Makale Başlığı: Yield and Quality Response of Canola to Seed Row and Side Banded Ammonium Sulfate and Ammonium Thiosulfate
Özet: Ammonium sulfate (AMS) and ammonium thiosulfate (ATS) are two of the most common sulfur products applied during canola seeding in the Canadian Prairies. A better understanding of how application methods affect the efficiency of these products is warranted. A field trial was conducted on a clay loam soil in Pense, Saskatchewan to evaluate the effect of seed row and side banded sulfur applications on canola yield and quality. Plots received 34 kg ha-1 sulfur either from AMS or ATS applied during seeding either in the seed row (SR) or side banded (SB). A treatment without sulfur was included as a control. All plots received the same amounts of all other nutrients. Results showed that average seed yields increased for all sulfur-treated plots, however, only side banded applications (AMS(SB): 4020 kg ha-1 , ATS (SB): 3883 kg ha-1 ) were significantly better than the control (3072 kg ha-1 ). Side banded sulfur applications generally produced more protein than seed row applications and were significantly different from the control. AMS (SB) had the highest protein content (21.07%) while the control had the least (18.13%). Oil content was similar except for AMS (SB) (46.72%) which was significantly lower than the control (48.68%). However, this oil difference was more than compensated by the increased yield from AMS (SB). Applying AMS and ATS in the seed row can decrease the yield and protein response that might otherwise be seen when these products are side banded. There were no significant differences in the measured parameters between AMS and ATS.

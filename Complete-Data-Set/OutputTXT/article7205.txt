Makale Başlığı: Molecular Identification and Determination of Antimicrobial Activity of Micromonospora and Nonomuraea Isolates
Özet: Actinobacteria are the largest member of the Bacteria group, which can live in different ecosystems and create a rich source of secondary metabolites. Rare actinobacteria have become one of the important targets in terms of active metabolites. Micromonospora and Nonomuraea, which are rare Actinobacteria, are among the genera that have attracted the most attention recently. In the present study, it was aimed to isolate Micromonospora and Nonomuraea genus members from an endemic species. 16S rRNA gene region analyzes were used for molecular identification of isolates. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that 10 isolates were members of Micromonospora and 2 isolates were members of Nonomuraea. It has been determined that Nonomuraea sp. HCI 01 and HCI 02 strains and Micromonospora sp. HCI 04, HCI 23, HCI 39, HCI 44 and HCI 49 strains have the potential to become a possible new species. In biological activity studies, Micromonospora sp. HCI 45, HCI 47 and HCI 49 strains were found to be active against E. coli, HCI 20 and HSF 02 against S aureus, and HCI 04 and HSF 02 against S. cerevisiae. Nonomuraea sp. HCl 02 was found to have antimicrobial activity against S. cerevisiae. The results obtained have shown that there are possible new species and the existence of biologically active molecules with the potential to be antibiotics.

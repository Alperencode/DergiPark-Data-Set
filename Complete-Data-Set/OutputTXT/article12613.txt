Özet: Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the reproductive health (RH) attitudes of nursing students.Methods: The universe of this descriptive study was consisted of 460 nursing students studying at the school of health of a university health in the spring semester of the 2017-2018 academic year. The research was carried out with the participation of 353 nursing students. The “Data Collection Form” and the “Reproductive Health Scale (RHS)” were used to collect the study data. Results: The mean age of the students was 20.71±1.83 years and 31.5% were 22 years and over. Among the students, 93.2% stated that they had information on reproductive/sexual health and 53.8% had received this information from their family and teachers. 61.2% of the nursing students expressed their opinion that reproductive/sexual health services should be provided for young people at school, 86.4% by a well-equipped professional and 69.1% by keeping the applicant's information confidential. The student’s gender and father's educational status created a statistically significant difference regarding the median general total scores of the RHS (p<0.05) while the other variables did not (p>0.05). Conclusion: Evaluation of the mean RHS general scores revealed that the positive attitudes of nursing students regarding RH needs to be supported. We believe providing peer or individualized training and consultancy services to the students regarding RH in addition to prioritizing this issue during the lectures could help the students develop positive attitudes.

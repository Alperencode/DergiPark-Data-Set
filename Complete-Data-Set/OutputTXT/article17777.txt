Makale Başlığı: Metaphorical Perceptions of Academicians Regarding Distance Education in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic in TRNC
Özet: The purpose of this research is to determine the perceptions of academics working in the TRNC towards distance education in thecontext of the Covid-19 epidemic through metaphors. In the qualitatively designed research, the phenomenology design was used. Allof the full-time and part-time faculty and staff working in all universities in the TRNC in the 2021-2022 academic year constitute thestudy group of the research. However, 110 people who participated on a voluntary basis were included in the study as a working group.Data were collected with a semi-structured interview form. The semi-structured interview form includes the metaphorical definition ofacademics and the reason for producing the metaphor. Content and descriptive analyzes were applied to analyze the data. Academicshave produced 78 different metaphors for the concept of distance education. These metaphors produced are divided into 2 categories as positive and negative. There were 4 themes in the positive category (Rescue, Usefulness, Necessity and Accessibility) and similarly, 4themes (Inadequacy, Inactivity, Ignorance and Unwillingness) emerged in the negative category. As a result, it was determined that thecategory in which academicians produced the most metaphors was the theme of inadequacy in the negative category. According to thisfinding, the academicians stated that it is not known whether the students can achieve permanent learning, that the instructor and the fieldare not sufficiently satisfied and that the students’ lack of knowledge cannot be eliminated in this way.

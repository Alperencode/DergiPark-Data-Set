Makale Başlığı: Current Approaches to Genome Sequencing in Sugar Beet (Beta Vulgaris) and Its Wild Relatives
Özet: Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) is one of the economically important crops grown for both food and sugar production. Breeders continue breeding studies to improve plant characteristics in line with their wishes. Along with sugar beet breeding; productive, high sugar content, durable superior varieties are being developed. However, their wild relatives are used to improve traits such as low genetic diversity, disease and pest susceptibility in cultivated beets. As wild relatives are adapted to specific habitats, they constitute an important genetic resource for the beet growing pond. Obtaining information about the number, identity and diversity of genes and alleles found in beets through genome sequencing is important for introducing and developing new traits in beets. In order to transfer the tolerance and resistance traits, which are the traits found in the wild relatives of the plant, to the cultivars, these traits must be determined. For this purpose, expanding the genetic base of sugar beet is important in terms of preserving ecologically important characteristics. For this, it is very important to determine the genetic information of cultivated beet and its wild relatives and to classify them according to each other phylogenetic.

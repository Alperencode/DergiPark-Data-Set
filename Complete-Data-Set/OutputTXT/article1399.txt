Makale Başlığı: Renewable Energy Resources, Biofuel Plants and Genetic Manipulations
Özet: The energy used in every aspect of our daily life is a necessary element and can be transformed into different forms. Energy resources are divided into renewable and non-renewable. Since non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), which will run out and cause global warming, nowadays, renewable energy sources are preferred as an alternative to these sources. Renewable energy sources are used to produce continuous energy such as biomass, solar, marine, geothermal, wind energy. Today, fuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas are obtained by using biomass. These types of fuel called biofuels are produced using plants, plant wastes and algae. In this review article, renewable energy, biofuel plants, their properties and genetic interventions on these plants are included.

Makale Başlığı: Can Natural Law and Divine Command Theory Keep Good Company?: John Duns Scotus on Morality
Özet: John Duns Scotus’ moral philosophy is generally regarded as an archetypal example of divine command theory, owing to the extensive freedom it assigns to God’s will and power. However, some philosophers have recently suggested that either his moral philosophy is inconsistent or that natural law also plays an important role in Scotus’ thought. Considering the untenable elements of divine command and natural law theory, Scotus can be suspected of being inconsistent. Nevertheless, it definitely will be a quick assumption to claim that Scotus has a conflict among the views on which he based his entire philosophy. This article aims to illustrate how Scotus employs the natural law and divine command theories in his philosophy -synchronically- without causing inconsistency, how he answers the so-called tension between the two theories, and what is more, to demonstrate how the simultaneous use of these theories can eliminate the shortcomings of both.

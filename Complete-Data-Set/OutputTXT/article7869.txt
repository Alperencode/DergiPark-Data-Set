Özet: Objective: Prolotherapy is a regenerative injection-based treatment which is increasingly using in musculoskeletal disorders. There are studies about the usage of prolotherapy in diseases but there is not an epidemiological study in the literature. The aim of this study is to resolve the lack of epidemiological studies about prolotherapy.Materials-Methods: Ten-thousand-three-hundred-nineteen patients who were applied to our outpatient clinic between January 1, 2017 and 2021 were included in the study.Results: The number of patients’ injured area was 10319 with the mean age of 54.2±13.8. 2886 male (28.0%) and 7433 females (72.0%) were evaluated, and 844 of these patients (8.2%) did not receive the treatment. The reasons for admission / treatment of the patients were 35.3% (3647) low back and hip pain, 33.9% (3503) osteoarthritis of the knee, 13.3% (1369) neck pain. The number of sessions was 3.90±2.0 for completed treatments. Treatment results of the patients showed a significant difference according to gender (p<0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between the mean number of sessions according to the gender of the patients (p<0.001). There was a significant relationship between the age of the patients and the treatment results according to the results of the one-way analysis of variance (Anova) (p<0.001). There is a significant difference between the mean of sessions according to the diagnosis distribution of patients (p<0.001).Conclusions: Better results can be obtained with the right patient selection and informing the patient correctly. Epidemiological studies are of great importance to learn these.

Makale Başlığı: A Look at the Participation of Individual Actors in the Image of the City Using Digital Platforms: An Evaluation on Google Earth
Özet: This study not only discusses the role of geographic mapping- based systems considered important in the process of managing city image as a result of digitalization, but also examines the participation of cities in the image-building process as a local guide with the participation of individual actors. In this context, the posts of individual actors through the Google Earth platform on the historical peninsula of Istanbul was evaluated. The study focuses on the concept of city image, the change of activities and actors involved in the image of the city under the influence of the digitalization process. In this context, content analysis was used to reveal the frequency and categorical distinctions of the photographs shared by the relevant actors. The results of the study show that both city residents (locals) and tourists (foreigners) share content about the Historic Peninsula, and that individual actors share content about Istanbul, including historical artifacts and cultural elements, especially during the day and in sunny weather. In addition, the visibility of many elements such as climate, history, cultural heritage, etc., as well as transport, entertainment, education, etc., which can be evaluated among the attractiveness elements in the city image phase, attracts the attention among the posts. A historical review of the posts shows that most of the posts were shared in 2017-2022, with similar levels of sharing by locals and foreigners, and Topkapı Palace, Süleymaniye Mosque, and Hagia Sophia Museum being the most shared.

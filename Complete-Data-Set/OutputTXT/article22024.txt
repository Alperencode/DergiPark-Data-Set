Makale Başlığı: Mathematical Modelling Processes of Elementary Mathematics Teacher Candidates: An Example of Waste of Water
Özet: This research examines the mathematical modelling processes of elementary mathematics teacher candidates. A case study, one of the qualitative research method designs, was used. A total of 63 elementary mathematics teacher candidates, 49 female, and 14 male, participated in the research. Participants were determined according to the criterion sampling method among purposive sampling methods. The data collection tools of the study consisted of written answer sheets related to the mathematical modelling problem prepared by the researchers following the real-life situation and the observation notes. Content analysis was used in the study of the data. The findings obtained from the research show that candidate teachers have some difficulties fulfilling the competencies in the mathematical modelling steps. It was determined that candidate teachers did not experience problems in understanding real-life problems, creating a mathematical model and performing mathematical operations to solve the problem, but they had problems interpreting mathematical results and verifying the validity of the results in an actual situation. At the end of the study, it was suggested to increase teacher candidates' model building awareness.

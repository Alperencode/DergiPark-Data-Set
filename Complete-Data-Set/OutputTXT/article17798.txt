Makale Başlığı: Mineralogical Characteristics of Middle-Late Miocene Age Clayey Rocks Crop Out Around Akın and Taşkonak Villages (Van) and Paleoclimatic Clues
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to determine mineralogical properties of Middle-Late Miocene marine clayey rocks of Van formation and to interpret the paleoclimate conditions during Middle and Late Miocene in which the rocks were formed. The study area is located in the Southeast of Lake Van. Four stratigraphic sections were measured from the Middle-Upper Miocene rocks and seventy three clayey rock samples were collected along these sections. All samples were analysed by X-ray diffraction to identify mineralogical compositions. Quartz, mica, feldspar, calcite, amphibole, dolomite, cristobalite and clay minerals were determined in bulk compositions of the samples. Clay fractions include illite, chlorite, smectite, serpentine, chlorite-smectite and illite-smectite mixed layers. SEM and EDX studies were performed on three selected samples. In the samples, smectite, chlorite, and serpentine were observed. Based on the coexistence of well-crystalline illite, chlorite, smectite and feldspar minerals, it has been interpreted that cold, dry climate conditions prevailed in the region during the formation of clastic rocks.

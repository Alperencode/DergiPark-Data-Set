Makale Başlığı: Free Vibration Analysis of Isotropic Plates Using Regressive Ensemble Learning
Özet: The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a popular technique that is employed to analyze and understand the behavior of a structure. Although it has various advantages, there are some drawbacks such as developing accurate mathematical models, the computational cost for complex systems, and expertise. Thanks to recent advancements in computational science, those drawbacks can be eliminated by integrating artificial intelligence. This study presents an ensemble learning regressor-based technique to evaluate the fundamental natural frequencies of isotropic plate structures. For this purpose, Random Forest Regressor (RFR) has been considered. The isotropic plates have been taken into account as square and rectangular thin and thick plates whose materials have been selected as Structural Steel, Aernet 100, Al 7108, and Al 2024 since they are frequently used in various engineering fields. It has been evaluated that the proposed technique has a 0.9936 correlation score (R2) and 0.0019 mean square error (MSE). The average prediction accuracy has been obtained by 99.12% for the test set. Those indicated that the proposed approach is not only an appropriate model for such a problem but also predicts the fundamental natural frequency accurately. Considering its success (99.12%) and the execution speed (0.127 seconds), it is concluded that the proposed approach is an advantageous alternative technique to the other mathematical models.

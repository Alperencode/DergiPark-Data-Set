Makale Başlığı: Calculation Of Spirulina (Spirulina platensis) Production Chemical Ratios by Devoloping New Software
Özet: Spirulinais a microscopic alga that contains rich proteins, minerals, vitamins,essential amino acids and essential fatty acids like γ-linolenic acid (GLA). Itis produced for diffrent industries such as food or medicine and sold as anatural supplement around the world. In laboratory conditions lots of chemicalsare using for production. These chemicals are sodium bicarbonate, sodiumcarbonate, potassium phosphate, sodium nitrate, potassium sulphate, sodiumchloride, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, iron sulphate and EDTA. As aresult of the necessity of critical calculations of these chemicals, there is aneed to develop software for spirulina production which is one of the mostimportant problems of this sector. Microsoft Visual Basic6 program was used inwriting a computer program to plan the daily work to be done, chemicalcalculations, laboratory conditions and to control financial affairs inSpirulina farm. Microsoft Access program was also used as a database. Insoftware, alga ponds, the amount of algas and planting date is firstly definedas computer data from the "Information Input" menu. Based on thesedefinitions, the program can calculate the harvest of algas, chemical ratiosfor planting and cost of chemicals. The software was tested by a big spirulinafarm in Adana of Turkey and seen that it can be use for anyone who wants toproduct Spirulina.

Makale Başlığı: Indoor navigation network models: A comparative investigation
Özet: Nowadays, the use of outdoor navigation applications is quite common. For indoor navigation, this case is still an emerging application due to the lack of use of a standardised positioning equipment, higher costs, accuracy issues, the more complex structure of indoor spaces and the fact that a comprehensive network model to support indoor navigation for floor-level paths and non-level paths and the studies on the computation of routes are not fully developed yet. Due to the degree of complexity of indoor spaces vary depending on the non-standard structures of buildings and the freedom of movement capability is in a wide spectrum, different navigation networks can be generated. In this study, the Medial Axis Transform (MAT) based methods and the Visibility Graph (VG) based network model that originates from isovists theory which are the prominent navigation network models in the literature are generated in the building information modelling of Yildiz Technical University Civil Engineering Faculty building by utilizing the two-dimensional floor plans of the building and a new approach is proposed based on the VG model by restricting the line of sight between sub-corridors of indoor space and combining it with the MAT. The usability of these navigation network models is compared in terms of the shortest distance and the fewest turns made on the route. The findings of the experimental study showed that the VG based network model which is shown in previous studies to be correlated with human perception enables a mean of 1.17 m shorter distances and 0.20 times fewer turns than the compared routes compared to closest network model. The statistical tests demonstrated that the proposed hybrid approach does not differ significantly from VG thus can be used instead of VG based model for various scenarios.

Makale Başlığı: Study of Developing Stereotyped Thoughts Scale Toward Science Courses
Özet: The study aims to develop a scale for determining the stereotyped thoughts of primary school classroom and elementary science teacher candidates toward science courses. Descriptive survey model, one of the quantitative research patterns, is used since the study follows the process of scale development. In sample determination, first stratified sampling and then easily accessible sampling method are used. The study groups consist of 611 pre-service teachers, wherein 302 was for Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) while 309 was for Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). For the validity of the scale, the number of content validity rate (CVR) was determined in line with the opinions of 14 experts and the scale items were arranged. For the construct validity of the scale, EFA was performed and total item correlation and item factor loadings were found to be at the desired level. As a result of the validity-reliability analysis of the study by adopting a Likert-type scale development model, a 28-item scale structure with Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient .81, consisting of five factors, was obtained, which explains 58.63% of the total variance.

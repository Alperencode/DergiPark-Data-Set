Makale Başlığı: TRANSLATIONS FROM TURKISH LITERATURE IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA PRESS
Özet: Translation was born as a result of the effort of human beings to know the world outside their own. Translation is a field related to the transfer of cultural signs, behaviors, habits, values, everything related to human life, beyond a transfer from a foreign language to the native language. It is the sharing of experiences, inventions and other nations’ ways of thinking. When we look at the history of humanity, we see that all innovations and enlightenments started with translation, and nations take advantage of each other. When the source text is passed to the target text, the doors of a new world are opened. Literature in Istanbul has been the main resource of literature in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has been under Ottoman rule for centuries, and numerous translations have been made from Turkish to Bosnian language. Translations made over the centuries, have had different purposes and results, bringing not only innovation but also cultural change and influence. Bosnian intellectuals who went to Istanbul during the Ottoman period learned Turkish and wrote poems with the style of Divan poetry. With the development of press life in the Austro-Hungarian period, translations from Turkish literature increased and they were published in the newspapers of this period. In this study, translations from Turkish literature in Bosnia-Herzegovina newspapers and magazines published during the Austro-Hungarian period are determined, and the effects of Turkish literature on Bosnian Literature are revealed.

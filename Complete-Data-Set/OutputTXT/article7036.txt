Makale Başlığı: VERSE TRANSLATION OF VARIOUS MAXIMS FROM HIS HOLINESS ALİ
Özet: The speeches, pieces of advice, letters, poems, and maxims of  His Holiness Ali (d. 40/661), one of the most important figures in Islamic history after the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH),  have also attracted Turkish literature's attention, and many works have been produced on these subjects. The well-known Arab scholar Câhız (d. 255/869) compiled hundreds of thousands of maxims attributed to His Holiness Ali under pseudo names like "Mie Kelime." Tabersî (d. 548/1154), on the other hand, collected nearly three hundred of them and deciphered them in Arabic alphabetical order under the name of "Nesrü’l-leâlî." These compilations have been translated or annotated dozens of times in the history of Turkish literature since the 14th century, to be exact, since the 15th century. The names or pseudonyms of most literary figures who translated the mentioned texts are known. But unfortunately, there is no information about their identity in the works of some others. Nesrü’l-leâlî, a poet whose century is not clear from his translations, translated 94 Arabic maxims which he selected from compilations such as Sad-Kelime-i Hazret-i Alî, into Turkish in double couplets. It is worth noting that in his work, where only one copy can be identified, the translator translated maxims beginning with the letters elif, be (b), te (t), se (s), cim (c).

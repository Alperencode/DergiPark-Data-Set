Makale Başlığı: Silahdar Kara Mustafa Pasha’s Basra Campaigns and the Reorganization of Basra Province (1667-1671)
Özet: This article deals with the particularities of the administration of Basra as one of the Ottoman provinces in its first two parts. After the conquest of Basra, Ottoman State introduced specific administrative and economic rules and regulations to govern the province better. However, several factors have prevented Ottoman governors from governing Basra effectively. Therefore, the Ottomans preferred turning over the management of Basra province to Afrasiyabs, a local noble family of the region, at the beginning of the seventeenth century. After the Afrasiyabs attempted to gain autonomy in Basra, the Ottomans decided to exercise direct control over the province for this purpose again. Accordingly, they organized several military campaigns under the command of the Baghdad governors. The third part of this article focuses on two Basra campaigns launched by Silahdar Kara Mustafa Pasha between 1667 and 1671. It evaluates his success in ending the Afrasiyab rule and making Basra one of the state-controlled provinces in the light of archival documents from the state archives.

Makale Başlığı: Effects of Covid-19 Pandemic on Employees in Turkey in Terms of Different Anxiety Levels
Özet: This study aims to compare economic, health, routine-change and isolation anxiety levels between private and public sector employees during the Covid-19 pandemic in Turkey. For this purpose, an online questionnaire is adapted from the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and sent to the 1111 participants from both sectors. It is hypothesized that economic anxiety would have a greater effect on private sector employees than public sector employees while the health anxiety has more dominant effects on public sector employees. To test the significance level of the mean differences between these groups, an independent sample t test was used and for testing the significance level of the mean differences among three or more groups one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. The t test results revealed that private sector employees had higher levels of economic anxiety on average than public sector employees. While there is no significant difference between the sectors in terms of health anxiety, routine change anxiety is higher on average over all other anxiety levels for both sectors. According to the results of one-way ANOVA test, employees living in minimum subsistence conditions, i.e., low-income group, had much more intense levels of economic anxiety than high-income group, and it was concluded that high-income group was under psychological pressure due to the routine changes they experienced. Finally, the results showed that private sector employees were more feared about getting short-time working allowances compared to public sector employees.

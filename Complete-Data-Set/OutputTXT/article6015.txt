Makale Başlığı: SPIRITUAL WELL- BEING AND NURSING; REFLECTIONS OF NURSES' SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING ON PATIENT CARE AND THEMSELVES
Özet: Sprituality is an integral part of health and well-being and has a distinct importance in the nursing profession. The nursing profession is focused on care, and the main purpose of care is to protect, maintain or assist the individual in all dimensions of the individual's existence. Nurses are responsible for providing spiritual care to the patients they care for. However, every individual in life needs spirituality, so nurses should primarily be aware of and develop their individual spiritual needs. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to examine the reflection of nurses' spiritual well-being on patient care and themselves.

Makale Başlığı: ‘ME’, ‘WE’ AND ‘THE OTHER’ IN YEVGENI ZAMYATIN’S DYSTOPIA
Özet: Changes and disruptions seen in a society become material for works, and reality and fiction meet on the same ground in literary materials. The mentioned ground is embodied by the descriptions of sites, cities, kingdoms, countries in ancient times, and communities and islands in modern times, which are not included in the maps but with the pen of the authors. A person who cannot keep up with the speed and unstoppable development of life's negativities, science and technology, and is stuck in its shadow, tends to be more pessimistic and have dark thoughts than the current life. As a result of these trends, it comes to life in dystopias that have gained momentum in literature since the 20th century. With dystopian literature, conveying the negativities of the current life with its opposites and drawing a more pessimistic portrait of the world cause the current life to be criticized, the writers to travel to imaginary places and also to accompany their readers on this journey.The concept of ‘utopia’, which took its place in the literary life with Thomas More’s work called Utopia in the 16th century, evolved into the concept of dystopia in the 20th century with Yevgeni Zamyatin’s work called We. For this reason, in the study, first the concept of ‘dystopia’ will be emphasized and then the concept of ‘other’ will be clarified. The study will be examined with the text-based analysis method and the concept of ‘other’, which draws attention in the works, will be underlined.

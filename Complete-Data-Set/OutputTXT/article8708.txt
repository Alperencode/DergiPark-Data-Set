Makale Başlığı: Examining the Effect of Venipuncture Technique with Vacutainer and Injector on the Rate of Hemolysis
Özet: Objective: This study was conducted to determine hemolysis rates for venous blood samples drawn by injector and vacutainer holder and to assess the effect of the venipuncture technique on the process of hemolysis.Material and Method: This cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted with 128 patients who were admitted to the Cardiology and Angio clinics of a university hospital and met the inclusion criteria. One group of patients who were to have routine biochemical tests underwent venipuncture with an injector, and another group with a vacutainer.Results: The serum hemolysis level is not significantly different by gender. No significant correlation was found between blood serum hemolysis levels and age or Body Mass Index with blood drawn with an injector or with a vacutainer. While the serum hemolysis level was on average 0.11 g/dl in blood drawn with an injector, the level in blood drawn with a vacutainer was 0.06 g/dl; the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion: This study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between hemolysis rates in blood drawn with an injector or with a vacutainer. However, the hemolysis rates in blood drawn with an injector were almost twice the rates noted in blood drawn with a vacutainer, and this difference may be clinically significant.

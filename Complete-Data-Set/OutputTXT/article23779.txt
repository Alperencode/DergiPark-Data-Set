Makale Başlığı: Field scale variability in soil properties and silage corn yield
Özet: Field scale spatial variability of soil properties, crop quality parameters and yield are needed to evaluate the efficiency of management practices in crop production. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of field variability in soil properties, silage yield of corn (Zea mays L.) varieties, and to characterize their spatial structures, and map the stated attributes. The experiment was conducted in an alluvial flood plain of lower Kazova watershed in Tokat province of Turkey. Several physical and chemical soil properties and silage corn yield were determined. Coefficient of variation (CV%) varied from 1.0% (pH) to 38.1% (P2O5) in herbicide not applied plots and from 0.9% (pH) to exchangeable Na (55.1%) in herbicide applied plots. Calcium carbonate, organic matter and clay displayed well defined spatial structure. Sand, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) showed moderate spatial dependency. However, silt, moisture content, bulk density, plant available phosphorus and potassium had weak spatial structure. Silage corn yield distribution map successfully distinguished the three corn hybrids planted. The difference in vegetation period among three corn hybrids was effective in distinguishing the location of hybrids within the field. However, the variability in each of the hybrids blocks was assumed to occur due to the difference in short range soil properties. The longest range values were obtained for silage corn yield at both herbicide applied and herbicide unapplied plots.

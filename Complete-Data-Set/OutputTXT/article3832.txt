Makale Başlığı: THE INDIA PART OF BABURNAME IN WORKS CONTAINING ACÂ'IB
Özet: Aca'ib, which is the plural of the word acib means interesting, surprising, wonderful, unprecedented things and gara’ib, which is the plural of the word garib, means foreign, strange and interesting. These two words, which mean very close to each other, have been used in Arabic and Persian literature since the 10th century gained a special meaning in the names of some encyclopaedic works such as: "Aca'ibü'l-Hind", "El-Muğrib An Ba'zı Aca'ibi'l-Mağrib", "Aca'ibü'l -Mahlukat ve Gara'ibü'l-Mevcudat”, “Haridetü'l-Aca'ib and Feridetü'l-Gara'ib”. These works are similar to each other in that they contain some mythical and folkloric narratives as well as information about sciences such as astronomy, medicine, geography, zoology, and botany. While some scholars accepted the works in question as a genre, others argued that they could not be a genre. In this article, it has been concluded that when these works are evaluated in terms of content, technique and purpose, they can form a literary genre. In addition, it has been concluded that works such as travelogues, embassies and memoirs, which are not exactly in this literary genre, but resemble aca'ib at some points, can be considered as works containing aca'ib. From this point of view, the third volume of Baburname, which is considered a memoir, has been examined in terms of containing aca'ib. Some narratives, information and descriptions in a copy of the Indian section of Baburname are quite similar to the works in the “aca'ib genre” in terms of content and style. Due to these similarities, it was concluded that the third volume of Babürname can be included among the works containing aca'ib.

Makale Başlığı: DETECTION OF SUSTAINABLE LOGISTICS SUB-COMPONENTS AND, DETERMINATION OF IMPACT LEVELS OF SUSTAINABLE LOGISTICS COMPONENTS WITH DEMATEL METHOD
Özet: Sustainable logistics can be defined as all logistics activities carried out by preserving and maintaining the present and the future for generations in environmental, economic, and social dimensions. In the study, the impact levels and sub-components of the main components in environmental, economic, and social dimensions, which are important for sustainable logistics, are examined. When the environmental dimension is examined, it is seen that its sub-components are use of resource (energy, water, material, etc.), water/soil pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution, and waste management. When the sub-components of the economic dimension are examined, it includes the components of product and service quality, cost minimization, recycling, market share/growth, and goods transport intensity. When the sub-components of the social dimension are examined, it is seen that the components of occupational health and safety, education and training, working conditions, and public health are covered. The impact levels of the main components of sustainable logistics are evaluated with the DEMATEL method, which is one of the MCDM methods. According to the DEMATEL method, while economic and environmental dimensions are in the affecting group, social dimension is in the affected group.

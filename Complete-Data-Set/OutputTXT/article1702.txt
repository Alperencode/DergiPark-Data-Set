Makale Başlığı: EXCHANGE RATE THE PASS THROUGH EFFECT IN BRICS-T COUNTRIES: PANEL COINTEGRATION TEST
Özet: Inflation rate and exchange rate variables are among the most important macroeconomic factors. The effect of these two variables on each other is frequently examined in the literature. In this study, in order to test the relationship between inflation and exchange rate in BRICS-T (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and Turkey) countries, the data of inflation and exchange rate variables for the period of 2000-2020 are discussed annually. Panel LLC unit root test, which is among the first generation unit root tests and frequently used in the literature, panel IPS unit root tests were applied. The long-term relationship between inflation rate and exchange rate variables was revealed by Pedroni and Kao cointegration analyses, and it was found that there was a cointegration relationship between the variables. After this stage, coefficient estimation was realised with DOLS and FMOLS methods, which are long-term coefficient estimators used in panel data analysis. According to the FMOLS result; in BRICS-T countries, a 1% increase in the exchange rate increases the inflation rate by approximately 0.28%. According to the DOLS result; in BRICS-T countries, a 1% increase in the exchange rate increases the inflation rate by approximately 0.23%. In the relevant period, it is concluded that the pass-through effect in the exchange rate in BRICS-T countries was realized as 0.28% and 0.23%, respectively.

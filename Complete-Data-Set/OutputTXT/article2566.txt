Makale Başlığı: DETERMINATION OF TOTAL PHENOLIC, ANTIOXIDANT, CHLOROPHYLL AND CAROTENOID AMOUNTS OF Lavandula angustifolia (LAVENDER) AND Salvia rosmarinus (ROSEMARY) UNDER HEAVY METAL (Cu2+, Cd2+) STRESS
Özet: In this study, Total Phenolic, Antioxidant, Chlorophyll and Carotenoid amounts of Lavandula angustifolia and Salvia rosmarinus plants subjected to heavy metal stress were determined. Copper and cadmium were used as heavy metals. A decrease in total chlorophyll (Cl), chlorophyll-a (Cl-a), chlorophyll-b (Cl-b) and carotenoid amounts was observed for both plants. It was observed that there was an increase in the amount of total antioxidant and total phenolic substance. According to the results of S. rosmarinus for the amount of phenolic substances, 81.70±1.68 mg/g GAE for the control group; 84.60±2.09 mg/g GAE for the heavy metal group. According to the antioxidant substance content results, 3.92±0.08 mmol/g TEAC for the control group; 4.02±0.01 mmol/g TEAC for the heavy metal group. According to the results for L. angustifolia for phenolic amounts, 80.05±2.25 mg/g GAE for the control group; 88.65±2.52 mg/g GAE for the heavy metal group. According to the antioxidant substance content results, 3.91±0.01 mmol/g TEAC for the control group; It was obtained as 3.99±0.01 mmol/g TEAC for the heavy metal group. Total Cl amount was determined 1.71±0.03 mg/g for S. rosmarinus control group, 1.04±0.02 mg/g for heavy metal group. Cl-a amount was 0.42±0.02 mg/g for the control group, 0.25±0.02 mg/g for the heavy metal group. Cl-b amount was 0.69±0.02 mg/g for the control group, 0.35±0.01 mg/g for the heavy metal group. The total amount of carotenoids was determined as 0.24±0.01 mg/g for the control group and 0.20±0.01 mg/g for the heavy metal group. Total Cl amount was 0.80±0.02 mg/g for L. angustifolia control group, 0.68±0.03 mg/g for heavy metal group. The amount of Cl-a was 0.25±0.01 mg/g for the control group, 0.22±0.01 mg/g for the heavy metal group. The amount of Cl-b was 0.30±0.01 mg/g for the control group, 0.29±0.01 mg/g for the heavy metal group. Total carotenoid amount was determined as 0.14±0.02 mg/g for the control group and 0.11±0.01 mg/g for the heavy metal group. As a result of the analyzes, the total phenolic, total antioxidant, total chlorophyll and carotenoid amounts of rosemary and lavender plants were determined. SEM images were examined to observe whether the heavy metal application in the study caused changes on the plant leaves. It was observed that there was a decrease in the amounts of chlorophyll and carotenoids, and an increase in the amounts of antioxidants and phenolic substances.

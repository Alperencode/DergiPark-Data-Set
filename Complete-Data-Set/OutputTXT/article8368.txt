Makale Başlığı: Practical Reflections of Methodological Differences: A Study on Sharia Stock Screening Criteria
Özet: Stocks are one of the most important financial instruments that enable Islamic finance to get rid of the banking sector and operate in the capital markets. Although the economic system based on partnership was frequently emphasized in the early periods of modern Islamic economic discussions, this idea did not find an equal response in practice. The fact that a company structure in accordance with Islamic principles has not been established due to some conditions that are considered illegitimate in terms of Islamic law, which is required by the conventional system, has caused Muslim investors to stay away from stock investments for a long time. In order to eliminate this negative situation and allow the development of Islamic capital markets, in 1992, the Islamic Fiqh Academy allowed investment in joint-stock companies under certain conditions. Within the framework of this permission, various opinions have been put forward and different Shariah screening criteria for stocks have been determined. These criteria vary according to the index provider institutions, the structure and scope of the indices, the countries in which they operate, and the Shariah boards that advise the indexes. However, the most influential factor on this diversity is the difference in methodology adopted by the Shari'ah advisory boards when making their judgments. In this study, how the difference in methodology affects the practice will be examined in terms of the shariah screening criteria.

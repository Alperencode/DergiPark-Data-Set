Makale Başlığı: Antimicrobial, antioxidant and mutagenic effect potential of red pepper  (Capsicum annum)
Özet: In this study, the biochemical, microbiological, mutagenic and antioxidant properties of red pepper (Capsicum annum) grown in 6 districts of Adıyaman province (Kahta, Gerger, Sincik, Samsat, Tut, Gölbaşı) were investigated. The bioactive compounds of Gerger samples, which also exhibited higher antioxidant activity. The results of antimicrobial activity showed that Kahta pepper extract exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with an MIC (minimum inhibition concentration) value of 0.715 mg/ml. The lowest MIC values in the pepper extracts were obtained in Kahta pepper extract (0.715-1.43 mg ml-1), and the highest MIC values were recorded in Tut pepper extract (1.1525-4.61 mg ml-1).  The mutagenic activity results of peppers indicated no mutagenic effect at the doses tests and in the studies carried out on TA 100 strains and Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and in the absence of S9. Dose dependent increase was recorded on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 strain of Samsat pepper samples. But, the rising was not statistically importent.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Effects of Ultrasound-Guided Transversus Abdominal Plane Block for Postoperative Analgesia on Recovery and Postoperative Hemodynamic Parameters in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy
Özet: Objectives: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become quite common all over the world. Severe pain may also develop after laparoscopic procedures. Postoperative pain can cause changes in many systems and increase the risk of complications. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis plane block on recovery and postoperative hemodynamic parameters in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Methods: The patients were divided into 2 groups as those who received paracetamol for postoperative analgesia and those who received paracetamol and TAP block. Postoperative hemodynamic parameters, peripheral oxygen saturations, VAS scores and Aldrete Scores of the patients were recorded from the patient files and compared.Results: VAS scores and systolic-diastolic arterial pressures were statistically significantly lower and Modified Aldrete scores and oxygen saturations were statistically significantly higher in patients with TAP block.Conclusion: We showed that in addition to conventional analgesia methods in patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, TAP block applied with USG facilitates postoperative pain control, provides a more stable hemodynamics and both better and earlier recovery. It will provide an advantage in terms of both recovery and complication risk, especially in patients with cardiovascular system disorders.

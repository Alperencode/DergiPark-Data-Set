Makale Başlığı: Acute Symptomatic Amitraz Intoxication
Özet: Amitraz is an insecticide that is frequently used as a pesticide in the world and in our country. Amitraz poisoning is rare and usually occurs in pediatric age groups. Central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia and hyperglycemia are mainly observed in poisoned patients. There is no specific antidote and treatment includes symptomatic measures. Herein, we report a 38-year-old male patient who ingested a glass of Kenaz solution (about 100 mL) as a suicidal attempt and admitted to our emergency department with hypotension, vomiting, and bradycardia.

Makale Başlığı: Dinden Felsefeye Batı Nazariyatının Kökenleri Üzerine
Özet: Cornford, who made a study on the origins of Western theory, claimed in his work "From Religion to Philosophy" that the origin of philosophical thought is based on Greek mythology and religion. The work, which offers a new historical reading against the views of the three dominant authorities on the origin of philosophy, was translated into Turkish by Özgüç Orhan in 2020. On this occasion, we tried to write an evaluation article in order to draw attention to the work presented to Turkish readers.

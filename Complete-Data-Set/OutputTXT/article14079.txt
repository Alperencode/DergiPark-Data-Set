Makale Başlığı: Abdurrahman b. Sahl el-Ansari
Özet: Knowing all aspects of the life of the Companions, which has an important place in laying the foundations of the religion of Islam, has been a subject of curiosity since the early periods of history. It attracts the attention of contemporary researchers more and more. In retrospective history readings, especially the turbulent events of history and the people who played an active role in these events aroused more curiosity and were primarily studied. After this preliminary step, it is the turn of the others. The subject of our study, Abdurrahman b. Sahl al-Ansari is one of these Companions. When we turned to the sources to research his life, we determined that there was more than one person with the same name and determined his personality based on his identifier and relative, so it became clear which Abdurrahman Sehl was the companion whose life we researched. In our research, Abdurrahman b. Sahl’s ancestry, his family, the wars he participated in with the Messenger of Allah, and his activities during the time of the first three caliphs were examined. Abdurrahman b. Sahl al-Ansari participated in the wars between the polytheists and the Muslims during the Medina period. He participated in the conquest movements during the caliphate of Hz. Osman and Hz. Omar. It has been determined that the Companion, whose date of birth is unknown, died during the reign of the third caliph, Hz. Osman. In our article, news containing different information from each other were conveyed and evaluations were made about the passing ons. While writing our study, Tabakat books and General History books, which deal with the biographies of the Companions, were taken as the basis.

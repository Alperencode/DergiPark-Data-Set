Makale Başlığı: A Research on The Use of Recycled Asphalt Coating Material in Concrete
Özet: The gradual disappearance of our natural resources, the search for new resources for aggregate supply and foreign dependence on bitumen materials encourage the reclaimed asphalt pavement. In addition, the high economic value of asphalt pavements gives rise to the idea that the reusability of the pavements should be studied.In this study; It is aimed to recycle the asphalt pavement used in road construction and to examine the recycling methods. In addition, scientific studies on recycled asphalt pavement material were examined. In the result of study; It was observed that the compressive strength and fluidity values of the recycled asphalt pavement aggregates decreased and the resistance to salt and frost increased. In addition, it has been determined that waste asphalt pavements are a very valuable waste in terms of economy, sustainability and energy saving. In addition, it has been understood that the reuse of worn and deteriorated asphalt pavements is very important in terms of environmental protection.

A web-based archive and media platform proposal is presented, which can cover all studies under the roof of systematic musicology in the field, which aims to contribute to the field by serving all levels of interest, primarily academicians and professional researchers, with contemporary components and potential for the future.In this context, in the text, a general definition is made by including the development of the musicology phenomenon, which constitutes the main axis of the study, from the historical process to the present, and this phenomenon, which is considered as the first of the four basic building blocks of the content by the author, is introduced in order to present a comprehensive perspective. For the same purpose, it is aimed to draw attention to the symbiosis relationship between the media as a communication element by emphasizing the importance of the evolution and information sharing from antiquity to the present. Following a briefing on the historical process within the scope of these two titles, three different basic phases in which the phenomenon of "university", which we can define as the institutionalized state of academic effort, has been classified from its formation to the present, and the basic components that form the general framework of the third generation concept, are explained and one of the contemporary academic media applications that are actively used today. By giving information about various examples, the elements that are positioned as the four basic building blocks of the content are completed and it is aimed to create a comprehensive perspective on the author's perspective.Finally, in line with this information presented, we aim to contribute to the field by facilitating access to accurate, quality and refined information for academics and professional researchers, as well as academicians and professional researchers, who have the potential to operate at an international level, in particular on maqam music, which is the subject of the author's doctoral thesis and constitutes the main field of study. A web-based archive and media platform design proposal is made with the aim of introducing the main functions and components of this design, which is the subject of the article, and the conclusion is reached.

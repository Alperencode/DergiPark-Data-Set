Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of The Halo Image Use on Non-Human Beings and Its Place in Art
Özet: Light rings around the head or on a part of the body or surrounding the whole body used to express the holiness of figures in works of art are called “halo.” Based on artwork samples, it can be stated that the origin of the halo image is most likely Asia, dating back to 600 BC. Sometimes they are depicted as fire and sometimes they are depicted as intertwined circles. Although their usage patterns differ among cultures, similar uses are also seen due to the interaction between cultures. In Christianity, which incorporates many elements from pagan culture, aside from the icons, the holy spirit, Jesus, angels, saints, and the four Gospel writers, they are also seen on popes, saints, and the protectors of churches, the representatives of the religion. It is not common to see haloes, used as signs of holiness, on animals. However, it is seen that they are also used on some animals such as doves, eagles, bulls, lions, and lambs. Animal figures with a halo, depicted in Egyptian art, continued to have a sacred quality in Christianity. In Turkish art, the animal depictions with halo differ from those in other cultures with their secular and decorative features. In this study, first, the historical process of the halo image and its varieties in different religions, cultures, and locations will be examined, information about the haloes seen on animals will be given, which is the most important part of the subject, and an analysis will be made on its place in art.

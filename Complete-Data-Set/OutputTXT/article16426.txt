Makale Başlığı: MAY THE HONEYCOMB ARCHITECTURAL DEVIATIONS REFLECT THE BEES ENGINEERING PROWESS?
Özet: This study affords the experimental evidences elucidate the putative mechanism of the bee comb establishing. Furthermore, the first time discerned skewed triangular prism in the bottom of the cells ab initio built up by Apis mellifera carpatica indicates that the traditional rhombic dodecahedra is not mandatory element of the comb architecture. The revealed oddity is inherent to about one third of the whole number of the cells constitute the analyzed patterns. The building abnormality presumably developed from the primeval manner of cells construction and may be triggered with the volatile natural factors e.g. geographic location and climatic zone, variety of floral shapes, duration of active season as well as bee race. Disclosed constructional diversity mirror the reaction of the colonies on the highlighted disturbances and might be stipulated by the bees’ ability to engineering prowess.

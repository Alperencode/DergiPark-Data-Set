Makale Başlığı: Ability to Have Children : Culture and Traditional Practices
Özet: Culture is defined as values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviors, customs and traditions that are learned, shared and passed on from generation to generation by a group of people. Birth is a biological event as well as a social/cultural life experience. The family, which is a traditional and social institution of the society, carries out the continuation of the generation with the function of reproduction and fertility. Having a child is an important status indicator in the society for a healthy family life. Inability to have children is a stressful and difficult situation to cope with, affecting both sexes emotionally and causing more stress and pressure for women. Some women with this problem may endanger their health by resorting to traditional practices for treatment. Often, these practices harm women's health and may delay early treatment. In order to improve the health-related behaviors of the society, it is an important necessity for health personnel to know which cultural factors are behind traditional treatment practices. It is to draw attention to the importance of traditional practices applied by societies about having children. Women are seen as inadequate in terms of infertility, they are accused and they can be subjected to violence. It is recommended that nurses, who have important responsibilities in the protection and development of women's health, evaluate women in the cultural environment they live in, and provide training and consultancy services on the prevention of harmful traditional method practices.

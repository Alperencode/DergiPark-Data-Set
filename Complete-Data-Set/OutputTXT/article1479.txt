Makale Başlığı: A Political Tool for Competitive Sustainability in Europe: Horizon Europe Programme
Özet: This paper presents a critical analysis on Europe’s new growth strategy. It argues that the new growth strategy blends competitiveness and its economic growth targets, with the limits of natural resources and environmental sustainability. It critically inquires the consistency between growth, profitability, productivity and efficiency, and environmental sustainability. On this basis, the paper questions the possibility of the mutual existence of competitiveness and sustainability. It analyses the mechanisms promoted for competitive sustainability – European Green Deal,European Semester, and Recovery and Resilience Facility. The paper argues that Europe utilises its research strategies to put competitive sustainability on a realist ground. It claims that, with its scientific and technological priorities, Horizon Europe Programme serves as a political tool for competitive sustainability in Europe.

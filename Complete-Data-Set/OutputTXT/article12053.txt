Makale Başlığı: About Verbal Adverbs That Formed By Combınatıon Of A Partıcıple Suffıx Wıth A Case Suffıx, and -ġayda Suffıx Used In Munyetu'l-Guzat
Özet: Verbal adverbs, which are frequently used verbals in all of the historical periods and contemporary languages of Turkic, are of two forms: verbal adverbs with simple structure and verbal adverbs formed by the combination of two affixes. The verbal adverb suffixes that are formed by the combination of two affixes are usually formed by a participle suffix plus a case suffix and indicate the time when the action takes place, is taking place, or will take place. Since the first written texts of Turkish language, there are many stereotyped adverbial-verb affixes in this way. In this study, the suffix -Gayda, that in the Munyetu'l-Ġuzat, one of the Mamluk Kipchak language heirlooms, is discussed. First, it was checked whether this suffix is used in historical and contemporary Turkish dialects; important language works of historical dialects of Turkish and grammar books on these languages were scanned. To evaluate whether the suffix is an adverb suffix formed by combining two affixes, examples of verbal adverbs made in this way throughout history in Turkic languages have been examined. It has been checked from the manuscript for a typo. As a result, an evaluation was made on the -ghayda structure.

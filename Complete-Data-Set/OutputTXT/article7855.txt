Makale Başlığı: Dimensioning of measurement and evaluation tasks in high school education mathematics text-books and examination of cognitive
Özet: The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between the tasks in the high school mathematics textbooks and the information in the textbook and their cognitive levels. For this purpose, it was decided to use the qualitative research method in the research. The data of the research were obtained through document analysis. In the research, the tasks related to the learning fields of “numbers and algebra”, “geometry” and “data, counting and probability” in the high school mathematics textbooks taught in the 2020-2021 academic year were discussed. The analysis of the tasks in the textbooks was carried out at the micro level. In the micro level analysis, tasks were sized as high relatedness, local low relatedness, and global low relatedness. As a result; In terms of the tasks in the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade textbooks, it was determined that the highest relatedness tasks and the least global low relatedness tasks. In addition, when the tasks in the textbooks of all grade levels were analyzed according to the revised Bloom taxonomy, it was determined that the tasks belonging to the application level were the most. For these reasons, the number of local and global low relatedness tasks in the textbooks can be increased and the tasks in the textbooks can be prepared considering metacognitive skills.

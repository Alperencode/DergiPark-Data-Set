Makale Başlığı: An Analysis on Tourism Myths Under Semıotic Perspective
Özet: Myths have been a form of language in the modern and late modern era for the sensemaking or normalization of phenomena as in the primitive epoch. Myths also offer an epistemological perspective and new discussion areas in making sense of tourism experiences. In this study, a literature review was conducted to present a general conceptual framework on tourism myths. A review study was carried out within the scope of semiotic studies in tourism by following the myth analysis approach of Lévi-Strauss on the basis of deep structural oppositions. Study findings  reveal that tourism myths can be conceptualized in critical and functional contexts. In the critical context, neoliberalism, postcolonialism, and neocolonialism ideologies come to the fore in tourism myths. In the functional context, mythical narratives are applicable as marketing medium of communication to promote destinations and experiences. The results of the study are expected to contribute to the literature with its conceptualization and analysis of tourism myths and the signs in tourism research.

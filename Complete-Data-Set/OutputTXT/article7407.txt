Makale Başlığı: Fatty acid and organic acid compositions of some Türkiye registered flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) varieties grown under alkaline soils
Özet: Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an industrial plant that is used for multi-purposes in the world with its oil and fibers properties and have commercial importance. Flaxseed oil, besides being an alternative oil product, is an important additive in functional foods and animal feeds. In addition, it is rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), lignans, proteins, dietary fibers and organic acids. Owing to its significant functions, the present study was designed to investigate the fatty acid and organic acid composition of flax cultivars (Karakız, Milas, Beyaz Gelin, Sarı-85, Konya Kahve, Clli1392, Clli1355) under alkaline stress conditions (≈pH:9,70). Accordingly, with respect to oil yield, highest yield was noted for Sarı-85 with a value of 2.28 g, whilts the lowest value (0.84 g) was recorded for Clli1392. Regarding oil components, in parallel to the yield, the highest percentage of α- linolenic acid was observed in Sarı-85 (60.51%) and the lowest value of the relevant compound was ascertained in Karakız (39.49%). In relation the profile of organic acid compounds; Clli 1355 were rich in succinic acid (46.705 ng/ul), lactic acid (35.238 ng/ul) and acetic acid (176.494 ng/ul), whilst Konya Kahve and Sarı-85 were found to be rich in propionic acid, 214.232 ng/ul and butyric acid, 32.895 ng/ul, respectively. In order to reduce the dimension, correlate and visualize the assayed parameters, the relevant data of the study was subjected to principal component analysis and heat-map clustering. The clear discrimination and scattering among the cultivars corresponding to the parameters were observed.

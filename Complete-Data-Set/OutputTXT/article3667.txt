Makale Başlığı: A MULTI-CRITERIA APPROACH TO EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF TR LEVEL REGIONS
Özet: Problems related to supply chain and operation management experienced today have negative effects for both producers and consumers. One of the most important parts of the supply chain is logistics. The logistics infrastructure and superstructures of the TR level coded regions used for the classification of specialized regions in our country positively affect the foreign and domestic trade of the region. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the performance of five TR level regions with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. Entropy and CRITIC methods, which are used to make an objective weighting of the proportional data of the logistics infrastructure and superstructure data of the TR level regions, were used in the application, which was carried out in two integrated stages. In the second stage, with the help of the calculated importance weights, VIKOR and TOPSIS methods were used to rank the TR level regions according to their performance. For the CRITIC method, it was determined that K11 (Railway km/person) had the highest weight and K14 (Airport number/person) had the lowest weight. For the ENTROPY method, it was seen that K6 (Highway Network km/person) had the highest weight and K10 (Railway km/km2) had the lowest weight. TR42 and TR31 were determined to be in the first place according to the performance evaluation of all multi-criteria decision making method of TR level regions.

Makale Başlığı: Disintegration in the Western Odjacks: Articles Breaking the Unity in the Treaties Signed by England and France with the Western Odjacks (17th – 19th C.)
Özet: After the administrative transformation in the Western Odjacks (Algeria, Tunisia, Tripolitania) in the 17th century, it became commonplace for the Odjacks to develop a policy independent of the capital. The Ottomans’ treaties with the European states, including the articles for the Western Odjacks, were largely ignored by the North African administrations. Thus, European states received permission from the Ottoman Empire to make a separate treaty with the Wes-tern Odjacks. Due to this permission, England and France made many independent treaties with the Odjacks from the second half of the 17th century to the Congress of Vienna and the Concert of Europe (1815). In these treaties, besides the use of special expressions such as "royaume, kingdom", which positioned the Odjacks as almost independent and separate states from the Ottoman, there were also many articles that broke the solidarity and unity of the Odjacks with each other. This paper aims to draw attention to England and France’s disruptive diplomacy and political attitude toward the Ottoman Western Odjacks through the treaties mentioned above and articles. Because ignoring the political and diplomatic attitudes of external states that reinforce separation can be misleading in recognizing the Western Odjacks alongside there are internal factors for the independence of the Odjacks from the Payitaht and their transformation into separate political units.

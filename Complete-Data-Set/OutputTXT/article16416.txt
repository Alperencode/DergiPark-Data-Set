Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATION OF NUMBER OF CHAMBER MEMBERS MINING, GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL ENGINEERING
Özet: Mining is a field of activity that has an important place in our lives. Mining, geological and geophysical engineers have a separate and important place in all processes, including exploration and operation of mines. In order to provide the service, which is considered as an engineering service in engineering disciplines, it is necessary to be a member of the relevant professional chamber. Mining, geological and geophysical engineers also have separate professional chambers. In recent years, there has not been a significant increase in the number of chamber members of these engineering branches, which are the subject of study. While there has been a slight increase in the number of mining engineering members, there has been a decrease in the number of geology and geophysical engineering members in 2020. In recent years, there has been a decrease in the number of quotas in the university departments of the engineering branches that are the subject of the study. In this study, research and evaluations were made on mining, geological and geophysical engineers registered in professional chambers in our country.

Makale Başlığı: Adaptation of the Stem Activities Motivation Scale For 7th and 8th Grade Students
Özet: In this research, it is aimed to adapt the motivation scale for STEM activities developed by Luo, Wang, Liu and Zhou (2019) to Turkish culture. In this direction, the original scale was ensured to be suitable for Turkish language and culture by referring to the expert opinion, and then the scale was applied to 359 students who were selected by random sampling and who were studying in two secondary schools in Osmaniye province Düziçi district. In order to determine the construct validity of the scale, confirmatory factor analysis was performed and it was determined that the concordance values were at the desired level and the construct validity of the scale was ensured. In order to determine the reliability values of the scale, the Cronbach Alpha value was checked. This value was calculated as .82 for the science factor, .71 for the technology factor, .81 for the engineering factor, .80 for the mathematics factor and .91 for the whole scale. The scale consists of four sub-dimensions, namely science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and 25 items. It can be said that the measurements obtained from the scale are valid and reliable. The minimum score that can be obtained from the scale is 25, and the maximum is 100.

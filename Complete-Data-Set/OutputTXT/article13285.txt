Makale Başlığı: The semantic features of interrogative in Turkish in terms of universal grammar and brain structure
Özet: Linguistic units play an important role in the meaning, use and interpretation of language. A person being born into a language acquires linguistic units without calling for a formal education, by means of the features of their brain. Humans are unique in their ability to acquire language. The biological features of human beings are also the main reason of processing language according to some universal principles. The brain, which perceives the outside world using deductive and inductive methods, sees the whole when creating meaning and the parts when producing a sentence. Questions play an important role in understanding both the part and the whole. The interrogative, which is used to obtain information about a subject, object, situation, event, time, place, quality, or quantity, appears to be a universal principle that can be found in any language.  Individuals exchange meaning through language, which makes them members of a society. The formation of meaning in the brain requires mental skills such as thinking, examining, questioning, estimating, associating, making choices, interpretation, analysis-synthesis, and evaluation. Language has both a surface structure and a deep structure. Understanding and interpreting expressions in the language occurs within a deep structure. This study focuses on the formation of meaning in the brain and language as well as the evaluation of  interrogative  in terms of universal grammar and semantic features.

Makale Başlığı: Situation of Lockdown Period in Turkey During Covid-19 Process
Özet: The Covid-19 process, affected the whole world not only economically but also physically and/or socially as well. With the Covid-19 pandemic process, the socialization of individuals was prevented and individuals were pushed into loneliness. In this context, the OSC-COVID19 Project was carried out in cooperation with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and Süleyman Demirel University (SDU). Within the project, an online questionnaire was made with 10,217 participants in Turkey in the 29 April-3 July 2020 period. Factor analysis and cluster analysis was made to find out the effects of lockdown period on the individuals, which started in March 2020. As a result of the analysis, three clusters with different characteristics are identified and it is revealed that each cluster experienced different situations related to the process of staying at home. The 1st cluster is observed to have experienced the feelings such as “anger, hate, fear, anxiety and sadness” the least. The 3rd cluster is found to be the cluster which experienced these negative feelings the most. It is foreseen that it is important to reveal the policies of the countries that support the citizens of the countries in minimizing the negative feelings of the individuals and to reduce their anxiety and to plan the activities for the socialization of the individuals, even from a distance.

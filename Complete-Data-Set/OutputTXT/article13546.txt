Makale Başlığı: Being a Developing and Developer Nurse
Özet: In a constantly changing and developing world, nurses provide nursing care to individuals with very different education, culture, age and economic status, and the education, professional values and professional ethical codes of the nurse help them while providing this care. In this care process, the nurse and the healthy or sick individual interact with each other. From this interaction, both the nurse and the person receiving care gain different benefits.If nurses develop themselves in this way, which is a continuous development, they also develop the individuals they care for and build trust. The nurse develops the individual she/he cares for, both in the delivery of health care and in health education. It enables the individual to take responsibility for her/his own health and to improve her/himself in this regard.

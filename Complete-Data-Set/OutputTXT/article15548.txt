Makale Başlığı: An experimental study to investigate the impact of Aspirin and Vitamin C therapy on fructose induced hepatic and pancreatic damage
Özet: It is assumed that excessive fructose consumption is associated with the risk of developing various diseases, especially metabolic disease. The aims of this study were two fold: 1) Does liver and pancreatic damage occur due to excessive fructose consumption 2) If damage occurs, can we reduce this damage by using (ASA) and Vit. C. The rats were divided randomly into five groups of eight as follows:  Group1-control; Group2-corn syrup (Fructose: F; 30% F solution); Group3-F and ASA (F+10 mg/kg/day, ASA, oral); Group4-F and Vit. C (F+200 mg/kg/day, Vit. C, oral); Group5-F, ASA and Vit C (F+A+C -same dose administration, respectively). The rats were sacrificed 24 h after the last application at the end of the 6th week, and their blood serum, liver and pancreas tissues were taken and evaluated histologically and biochemically. It was found that serum cholesterol and AST levels were significantly lower in the F+C and F+A+C groups, and ALT and TG levels were significantly lower in the F+A+C group compared to the F group (p<0.05). ASA and Vit.C significantly decreased TNF-alpha, which is responsible for inflammatory cytokines, and amylase, which is an indicator of pancreatic damage, compared to group F (p<0.05). As a result of histopathological examinations, the protective effects of ASA and Vit. C against the damage and fattening caused by fructose in the liver and pancreas tissues were observed. The use of antioxidants seems to be an important and promising option in preventing the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease due to excessive fructose consumption and the accompanying diseases.

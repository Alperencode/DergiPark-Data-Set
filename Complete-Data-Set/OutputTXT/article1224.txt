Makale Başlığı: Perioperative anxiety in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty
Özet: Aim: Septorhinoplasty is a frequently performed surgery in otolaryngology clinics that may induce perioperative anxiety in patients. Although such anxiety is considered a normal part of the surgical experience, it has negative consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the perioperative depression, anxiety, and postoperative pain scores of patients who underwent septorhinoplasty, as knowing this information has the potential to improve their recovery process.Methods: A total of 46 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty in 2019–2021 were included in this prospective study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure anxiety and depression, and the Visual Analog Scale was used to measure patients’ postoperative pain (POP).Results: A comparison of preoperative and first postoperative day HADS-A scores revealed a significant decrease in the scores (p=0.001). HADS-A and HADS-D scores decreased significantly after internal nasal splints were removed (p<0.05). A positive correlation was found between postoperative HADS-A scores and POP values (p<0.001).Conclusion: Perioperative anxiety should be mindfully considered in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty. Early removal of the internal nasal splints may reduce patients’ anxiety.

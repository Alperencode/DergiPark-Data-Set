Makale Başlığı: Shoulder injury related to rabies vaccine administration: a case report
Özet: Reactions at the vaccine injection site are usually mild and transient. Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as myalgia and arthralgia, are commonly seen following vaccination. Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA), defined as shoulder pain and limited range of motion in the shoulder after intramuscular vaccine administration into the upper arm, may occur due to incorrect vaccine administration. Using the appropriate injection technique in the intramuscular administration of vaccines will reduce the risk of SIRVA. In this paper, we report the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 26-year-old female patient presenting with SIRVA after rabies vaccination and discuss this case in light of the current literature.

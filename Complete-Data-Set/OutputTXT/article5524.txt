Makale Başlığı: HOW PREPARED ARE WE FOR THE NEW FACE OF TERRORISM? ASSESSMENT ON THE POTENTIAL THREAT OF AGROTERRORISM
Özet: This study analyzes agroterrorism, a potential threat. Considered a sub-title of bioterrorism, agroterrorism refers to the attacks that terrorist organizations could carry out by using biological agents and pests on the agriculture and food sector. The existence of biological attacks against opposing parties at various times in history and the execution of special biological weapons programs by states reveal the possibility of terrorist organizations reaching this potential as an element of fear. The possibilities of increasing the possibilities and capacities of terrorist organizations, which constitute one dimension of the new terrorismdebate, to the extent that weapons of mass destruction could be used are discussed throughout the study. The study aims to contribute to the field by evaluating the threats that agroterrorism may pose and how prepared societies are for bioterrorist attacks.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of the Ring Spinning Machine Top Drafting Roller Hardness and the Fiber Blend Ratio on the Quality of Yarn
Özet: The ring spinning machine, in which the fibers are converted from the roving form to yarn, applies higher draft than the roving frame and roving frame. The rate and control of this draft has a great importance on yarn quality. During this controlled shooting, the hardness of the upper drafting rollers and the size of the clips placed on the aprons are of great importance. The cot stiffness and the clip type determine the dimensions of the fiber clamping surface between the rollers. The hardness of the upper roller used, the pressure applied to the top rollers, the type of clips that adjust the distance between the top and bottom rollers are the parameters that control the controlled drawing in this context. The aim of this study is to improve the yarn quality by changing the cot stiffness. For this, two different experimental factors were chosen to investigate the effect of cot stiffness and fiber type on yarn quality. The first factor is the upper roller hardness at three different lower levels, 70, 76 and 83 shore. The second factor is the fiber type, and the fiber type has two different sub-levels. In this context, the yarns consisting of different fibers planned to be produced are 20/1 Ne 50/50 cotton/acrylic and 20/1 Ne 100% acrylic yarns. Unevenness, thin/thick place, neps, hairiness and strength tests were carried out on the produced yarns. The results obtained were analyzed statistically and the effect of cot stiffness and fiber type on yarn quality was revealed.

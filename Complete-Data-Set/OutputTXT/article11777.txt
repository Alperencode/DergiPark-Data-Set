Makale Başlığı: Thermal, Sound and Fire Performance Properties of Prefabricated Facade Panels with Massive, Sandwich and Frame Design Concepts
Özet: Many reasons such as the Industrial Revolution and the need for rapid building production after the Second World War have led to an acceleration of developments in the construction sector and new construction systems have emerged. These construction systems have brought forth the need for new facade designs. Prefabricated facade panels designed with the aim of quickly closing a building whose structure is completed so that it is least affected by external environmental conditions and ensuring that the facades created can exhibit good performance are also among these innovations. In this study, thermal and sound insulation, and fire resistance performance characteristics of prefabricated facade panels with wood, concrete, metal, or terracotta-based structure material, made with three different design concepts as massive, sandwich, and frame, were examined. The study is considered important because it examines the characteristics of facade elements aimed at improving the quality of the indoor environment.

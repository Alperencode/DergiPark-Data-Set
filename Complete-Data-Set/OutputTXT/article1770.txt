Makale Başlığı: Late Roman Light Coloured Wares From Tripolis
Özet: During the excavations carried out in the Ancient City of Tripolis, located within the borders of the Lydia Region, a large number of local/imported ceramics belonging to the red slipped ware groups dating to the Late Antiquity were found. One of these groups is the Late Roman Light Coloured Wares, which differ in clay, slip and decoration style. Light Coloured Wares, with a total of 11 samples identified between 2012 and 2019, constitute one of the least number of finds among the red slipped wares recovered from Tripolis. The main subject of this study is to make a typological analysis of the Light Coloured Ceramic samples found in Tripolis and to help determine the distribution area of this material group, whose production center is controversial. In addition, although the number of ceramics produced by local workshops in the city is quite high, the city’s Late Antique It is known that it had a wide ceramic trade network, including the Eastern Mediterranean. In this context, another subject to be discussed in the article is to illuminate the role of Tripolis in the imported the Light Coloured Ware trade in Late Antiquity.Considering both the similarities observed in clay and slip properties and similar studies, the Tripolis Light Colored Wares examined in this context are thought to have been imported from the Northwest Anatolian region, which is suggested to be the production area of this type of ceramics. It is suggested that Tripolis Light Coloured Ceramics belong to the period between the 5th century AD and the beginning of the 7th century AD, based on the found context of similar samples and material recovered from other cities.

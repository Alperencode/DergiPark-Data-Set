Makale Başlığı: The Production and Optimization of SnO2 Electron Transporting Layer by Slot-Die Technique
Özet: Thin films forming the basis of the micro and nano structured optoelectronic industry are one of the most studied research topics and have an important place in technological and scientific research. Although there has been a rapid development in the production of semiconductor metal oxides in recent years, thin films are mostly prepared by spin-coater technique, which is not very suitable for large-scale production. In this study, SnO2 metal oxide material, a highly required material by many optoelectronic device technologies, was produced in commercial sizes, with appropriate thickness and good morphological/optical properties by slot-die coating technique with a detailed optimization processes. By changing various parameters such as solution concentration, head-substrate distance, dispense rate, coating speed, table temperature on the existing slot-die system, the most suitable coating parameters were determined in ambient conditions. SnO2 thin films were successfully coated on large area (25 x 75 mm) substrates by facile and economical slot-die technique under optimum conditions and compared with the films produced by the widely used spin coating technique. Optical characterizations of the ensuing thin films were performed using UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectrophotometers. Surface and cross-sectional morphology was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). This study provides an important roadmap for the deep understanding of the slot-die technique by users and the large-scale production of different materials in various optoelectronic applications.

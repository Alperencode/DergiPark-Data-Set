Makale Başlığı: Synthesis, characterization, antibacterial, antioxidant activity, and lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition profile of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by green synthesis from Seseli resinosum Freyn & Sint
Özet: In the study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were successfully synthesized by an environmentally friendly synthesis method using Seseli resinosum Freyn & Sint extract. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet/visible light absorption spectrophotometer (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. As a result of the characterization, it was determined that 33 nm spherical nanoparticles were formed, showing a spectrum at 420 nm wavelength. Silver nanoparticles showed a bacteriocidal effect against all bacterial strains. DPPH and ABTS methods were used to examine the antioxidant activities of plant extracts and AgNPs. In DPPH removal activity, AgNPs obtained by green synthesis provided a high rate of inhibition removal compared to the extract. According to this percentage, while silver nanoparticles provided 22% removal, the extract provided 15% removal. In ABTS removal activity, when AgNPs were obtained by green synthesis compared to the extract, silver nanoparticles provided 25% removal, while the extract provided 18% removal. The characterization of silver nanoparticles synthesized by the green synthesis method and their antioxidant activity were investigated, and the obtained values indicate the presence of an antioxidant capacity. In addition, the inhibitory effects of the extract and AgNP on lipoxygenase activity, which has an important place in health, were investigated. It was determined that the aqueous extract of S. resinosum and the AgNP synthesized from the extract had lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitory activity.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of self-esteem and sexual function levels of patients who diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome:  a prospective study
Özet: Aim: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is seen in 5-10% of women, it affects many systems as a result of hyperandrogenism. In addition to its endocrinological and metabolic results, it has been reported that women with PCOS have a decrease in their self-esteem levels due to body image disorders. Sexual dysfunction such as sexual desire, orgasm, arousal and sexual satisfaction occurs in patients with PCOS due to both physical changes and emotional differences. Our aim in this study is to analyze the self-esteem levels and self-esteem levels of women diagnosed with PCOS and to evaluate the factors affecting them.Material and Method: Women between the ages of 18-55 who were diagnosed with PCOS were prospectively included in the study. Demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status, and employment status, were recorded. The patients’ self-esteem levels were analyzed with the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RBSS). The sexual dysfunction scale (SDS) was used to evaluate the sexual dysfunctions of the women participating in the study. The p<0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyzes.Results: Overall 51 patients diagnosed with PCOS were included in the study. The median age was 28 years (IQR 24-32). The most common symptoms and signs were obesity (68.6%), oligomenorrhea (66.7%), polycystic ovaries (66.7%), and hirsutism (52.9%). The mean RBSS score was 1.41±2.1; 49.0% of women had high self-esteem, 43.1% had medium self-esteem and 7.8% had low self-esteem. Women with acne and hirsutism had a higher rate of low self-esteem (p=0.014 and p=0.023, respectively). While the sexual desire levels were low in 47.1% of the women; the median sexual desire score was 4.2 (IQR 3-4.8). Sexual arousal levels were significantly lower who had hirsutism (72.0%-37.5%) and oligomenorrhea (68.8%-29.4%) (p=0.015 and p=0.022, respectively). Only 43.1% of women had low orgasm levels during sexual intercourse; and 31.4% had low level of sexual satisfaction. Pain level during sexual intercourse was low in all women. Sexual dysfunction was also observed in 43.2% of women with PCOS.Conclusion: One of the most important comorbidities of PCOS is sexual dysfunction. Sexual reluctance, especially with the effect of physical changes and hirsutism, is the most important part of sexual dysfunction.

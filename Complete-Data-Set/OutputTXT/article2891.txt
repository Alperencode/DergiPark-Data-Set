Makale Başlığı: Türkiye’s Climate Policies in the Context of Sustainable Security
Özet: Climate change is becoming one of the most crucial problems threatening the integrity of the global system. The impacts of climate change have been posing new threats to the states’interests, human prosperity and environmental sustainability. This article aims to analyze Türkiye’s climate policies within the context of the sustainable security approach, which focuses onthe balance between national, human and environmental security. The study argues that Türkiye’s economic priorities prevail over its climate strategies. Moreover, Türkiye becomes more vulnerableand less resilient to the impacts of climate change as long as the country’s carbon emissions continue to rise. Therefore, this article argues that if Türkiye considers the risks of climate change witha sustainable security approach; economic advantages, social prosperity and environmental protection for both present and future generations could be equivalently guaranteed.

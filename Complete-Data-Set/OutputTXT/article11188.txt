Makale Başlığı: Effect of different protein sources on protease activity of Neon tetra, Paracheirodon innesi (Myers, 1936) juveniles
Özet: Neon tetra, Paracheirodon innesi, is a highly valuable fish species for the aquarium sector. In this study, to determine the inhibitory effects of different protein sources (soybean protein concentrate, soybean meal, fish meal, shrimp meal, krill meal, corn gluten and chicken meal) on early life stage proteases, invitro assays were applied. At the end of the study, the highest inhibition ratios were obtained from soybean protein concentrate (53.59±0.58 %) as plant protein sources. On the other hand, the minimum inhibition ratios were obtained from shrimp and chicken meal (21.88±0.74 % and 21.88±1.26 %, respectively) (p>0.05). In conclusion, it is concluded that the soy bean protein concentrate should not be used in the commercial diets as protein source on ongrowing size of this species.

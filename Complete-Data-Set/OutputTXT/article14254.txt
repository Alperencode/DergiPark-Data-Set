Makale Başlığı: Trans-lating/forming City Signs: Transfigured Faces of an Istanbul Narrative
Özet: The space in which the events take place in a novel is not chosen randomly; therefore, the connection of the fictional or real space with the place it represents is a matter to be considered carefully. Moreover, it is a fact  that in the literary texts about the city, not only the city but also certain stereotypes of the culture it is part of are exposed. From Russia With Love (1957) by Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, is perhaps the most popular of the spy novels set in Istanbul. Even though Fleming uses Istanbul as the novel’s setting, he has carried over prejudices toward Turkey and Turks in his book. The corpus of this study consists of the novel titled From Russia With Love and its Turkish and French translations. An interdisciplinary approach is adopted on the basis of the interplay between  translation and semiotics, and significant transformations of meaning related to space in the comparison of source text and target texts are discussed based Sündüz Öztürk Kasar’s approach to Semiotics of Translation. For this purpose, “segmentation of the text” and “isotopies in the text” compiled by Öztürk Kasar from the studies of Paris School of Semiotics and the semiotic square developed by Algirdas Julien Greimas are adopted as operations of analysis,  and the analysis is  scrutinized in the light of the concept of Orientalism by Edward Said. Finally, the signs related to Istanbul and Turks in the source text and their reflections in the target texts are compared and evaluated through  “Systematics of Designification in Translation” (2020) developed by Öztürk Kasar. The study concludes that Orientalist clichés explicitly or implicitly reproduced in the English source text are transmitted in the same way in the French target text; Turkish translations, on the other hand, overturn the negative image created by the source text for Istanbul.Keywords: Semiotics of Translation, Systematics of Designification in Translation,  Orientalism, Ian Fleming, From Russia with Love.

Makale Başlığı: Alterations in leaf cellular physiology and chlorophyll biosynthesis during leaf expansion in peach tree
Özet: The effects of leaf expansion on leaf cell physiology and chlorophyll biosynthesis were evaluated in peach tree. The expanding leaves (young leaves) and the expanded leaves (old leaves) of Rich May peach cultivar grafted onto Garnem were compared. The parameters related to leaf expansion were evaluated end of May. Stomatal conductance increased in expanded leaves, while leaf temperature decreased. The difference in stomatal conductance appeared to be associated with stomata size rather than stomata number. The concentrations of chlorophyll precursors including Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX and Pchlide increased during leaf expansion. Cortical cell division and expansion increased during leaf expansion. Furthermore, xylem size and number significantly increased during leaf expansion. Cell expansion had a major influence on leaf size in peach.

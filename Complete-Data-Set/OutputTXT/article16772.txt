Makale Başlığı: Turkey's Role in the Common Security and Defense Policy as a Non-EU Member of NATO
Özet: European security is an important field of activity for NATO and NATO expressed its support to the transformation of the EU's common security and defense policy. However, the position of Turkey, which is a non-EU member of NATO, has been a turning point for either starting NATO-EU cooperation or confrontation. Turkey, on the other hand, despite being a valuable partner during the Cold War, playing a key role in NATO and contributing to several security operations, peacekeeping missions, and anti-piracy and counter-terrorism efforts in the post-Cold War era is exposed to discriminatory policies by the EU due to an atmosphere of distrust Southern Cyprus led and the absence of EU membership. This study tries to examine whether Turkey, which is a NATO member, has the possibility of finding a common working ground with the EU's CSDP. In the study, it is concluded how Turkey has successfully contributed to the peacekeeping military and civilian missions carried out within the scope of NATO and the EU, and how it has been in harmony with the CSDP for years, although it has declined after 2011.

Makale Başlığı: Classification of Chest X-ray COVID-19 Images Using the Local Binary Pattern Feature Extraction Method
Özet: Background and Purpose: COVID-19, which started in December 2019, caused significant loss of life and economic losses. Early diagnosis of the COVID-19 is important to reduce the risk of death. Therefore, studies have increased to detect COVID-19 with machine learning methods automatically. Materials and Methods: In this study, the dataset consists of 15153 X-ray images for 4961 patient cases in three classes: Viral Pneumonia, Normal and COVID-19. Firstly, the dataset was preprocessed. And then, the dataset was given to the Cubic Support Vector Machine (Cubic SVM), Linear Discriminant (LD), Quadratic Discriminant (QD), Ensemble, Kernel Naive Bayes (KNB), K-Nearest Neighbor Weighted (KNN Weighted) classification methods as input data. Then, the Local Binary Model (LBP) texture operator was applied for feature extraction. Results: These values were increased from 94.1% (without LBP) to 98.05% using the LBP method. The Cubic SVM method's highest accuracy was observed in these two applications. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the performance of the presented methods with LBP feature extraction is improved.

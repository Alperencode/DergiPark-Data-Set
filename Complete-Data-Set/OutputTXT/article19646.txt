Makale Başlığı: A Study on the Ark of the Covenant (Tabot) in Ethiopian Culture
Özet: The inspiration, name, content, and fate of the Ark of the Covenant, which God had Moses build with the Sinai Revelation, has been the subject of many studies. Since this issue has been mentioned in the Qur’an, it has also become the agenda of Muslims. Due to its extraordinary powers, there have been different narrations about the Ark in various religious traditions. One of them is the Abyssinian tradition. This tradition, separated from mainstream Judaism and Christianity, draws the mystery of the sacred object to these lands by using its original name. Thus, the present study discussed how the Ark of the Covenant was called the Tabot, and analyzes the process of it being brought to the Abyssinian lands and its adventure to reach the present day were tried to be analyzed. In addition, it has been reported that in the Abyssinian culture, the Tabot was renewed and even differentiated according to Christian motifs. In fact, the altar tablet used in the surrounding churches gained a new form by taking the features of the Ark in the Abyssinian tradition. Beyond that, the identification of the Tabot with Mary in Abyssinian culture has gained a new dimension in terms of the Ark being the so-called residence of God. Therefore, the Abyssinian tradition stands out, based on its attributes to the Tabot and its replicas.

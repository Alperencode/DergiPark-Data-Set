Makale Başlığı: NEW FACE OF ADVERTISING: INTERACTIVE OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS
Özet: Unable to respond to contemporary habits of society, and realizing that they can hardly compete with new media in this regard, traditional media have opted for cooperation with new media. Traditional media should be able to accommodate the possibilities afforded by new media, namely lack of temporal or spatial limits, and ability to promote interaction thanks to openness to intervention. As they like to interact, refuse to be passive in the face of messages, and wish to direct the advertisement, the target audience here can be referred to as users.  The present study discusses outdoor advertising tools that are most suitable for new type of people who spend most of their time outside home. The study focused on how to adapt outdoor advertising tools to new profile of people by imparting communication dimension into their inherent advantages, and emphasized that ensuring their hybridization will blow new life into traditional media which are important in the advertising world.

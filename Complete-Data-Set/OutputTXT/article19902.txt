Özet: Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the dominant affective temperament and the impulsivity of bipolar disorder (BD) patients with and without comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in comparison with healthy controls.    Method: The study was conducted among outpatients of the psychiatry clinic of Fırat University Hospital. Thirty patients with the diagnosis of BD with comorbid OCD, 40 patients with the diagnosis of BD without OCD, and 40 healthy controls similar to the study groups in terms of age and gender. The patients and controls were asked to complete a socio-demographic data sheet, Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, San Diego Autoquestionaire (TEMPS-A), and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11). Patients were also evaluated by Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).    Results: In both study groups frequencies of dominant depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, and anxious temperament and their scores were significantly higher than those of controls. There was no difference between BD patients with and without OCD comorbidity in respect to their dominant temperaments. The patients scored significantly higher on the BIS-11 total and sub-dimensions than the controls. The scores of attention related with impulsiveness in BD patients with comorbid OCD were significantly higher.    Conclusion: In our study we found that BD patients with or without comorbid OCD exhibited differences in some subscores of temperament characteristics and impulsivity when compared with healthy controls.

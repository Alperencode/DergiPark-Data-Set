Makale Başlığı: The Use of Laser Scanners in Documenting Cultural History
Özet: Once the tangible or intangible cultural heritage is destroyed, it cannot be replaced, so it needs to be made sustainable, protected and documented. Since our country is surrounded by seas on three sides and maintains its geopolitical importance in every century, it has hosted many civilizations. Therefore, there are many intangible and tangible cultural heritages in our country. It is beneficial to use fast and high-accuracy techniques for the documentation of cultural heritages, which are numerous in our country. Different techniques have been applied for the documentation of cultural heritages in the past and today. These techniques can be divided into traditional and technological. Although traditional techniques are insufficient for damaged or sensitive detail measurements, they have begun to be abandoned due to their low sensitivity and slowness. Today, traditional documentation techniques have been replaced by technological documentation techniques with fast, optimal cost, high accuracy and precision. Some of the technological documentation techniques; total station, GNSS, lidar, photogrammetry and laser scanning technique. In this study, the definition and importance of cultural heritage is explained, and the comparison of traditional method and technological methods by mentioning; the subtleties of the laser scanning technique, which is one of the technological methods, and its comparison with other techniques; Classification of laser scanners, measuring principles of laser scanners and technical specifications of terrestrial laser scanners of some commercial companies are presented.

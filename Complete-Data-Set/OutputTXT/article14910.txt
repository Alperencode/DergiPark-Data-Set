Makale Başlığı: Scientific and Technological Intelligence in the World War II
Özet: In this study, the origin, development, and effects of scientific and technological intelligence during the World War II are examined. In the World War II, both Axis Powers and the Allied Powers fought on the battlefield as well as in the research labs. In this context, one of the main objectives of the warring parties was to determine the scientific and technological capacities, weaknesses, and strengths of the enemy countries, their ability to adapt new technologies to the battlefield, and to develop new arms of offense and defense. Scientific and technological developments in the World War II played an important role in the development of scientific and technological intelligence by affecting the quality of intelligence gathering tools and intelligence analysis. The development of scientific and technological intelligence, on the other hand, affected the course and results of the World War II. In the study, the development process of scientific and technological intelligence was discussed in a historical perspective by using the qualitative research method, and it was aimed to answer the question of what role scientific and technological intelligence played in the war. In the article, it was concluded that scientific and technological intelligence not only affected the developments in the World War II but also the post-war developments, especially the Cold War, and triggered the starting of the armament race between the USA and the Soviet Union.

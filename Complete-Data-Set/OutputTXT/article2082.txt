Makale Başlığı: The Constitution-Making Processes in Divided Societies: The South African Experience
Özet: In divided societies, the constitution-making processes is important in the context of democratic constitution. Constitution-making methods are as important as constitutional regulations and preferences in terms of the democratic constitution.  Processes of democratic constitution-making must be open to participants from all sections of society. The most original and striking example of participatory constitution-making is the South African constitution-making process. This process provided a transition from the apartheid regime to democracy. To make the constitution-making process reliable, the Assembly endeavoured to make the principles of transparency and participation prevail during the process. The South African constitution-making process is an example of successful democratization. The South African experience is also of important in demonstrating how decisive the constitution-making method is in conflict resolution.

Makale Başlığı: Which Phenotypic Method Is the Most Accurate for Detection of Extended – Spectrum β-Lactamases (ESBLs) in Escherichia coli ?
Özet: Objective: The aim of the study is to determine the Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamases (ESBLs) by three different phenotypic methods of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains that isolated from various clinical samples. Methods: A total of 93 E. coli samples were isolated from hospitalized patients. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by automated system Phoenix 100 (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA). ESBL production was tested by double disc synergy test (DDST), combined disc test (CDT) and three-dimensional test (TDT). All statistical analyses were done using statistical packages SPSS Demo Ver 22 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Results: In the investigation of ESBL production among E. coli species, 87 (93.5%) strains were ESBL positive by DDST, 73 (78.5%) strains were ESBL positive by CDT, 71 (76.3%) strains were ESBL positive by TDT. According to statistical analysis: There were statistical differences between DDST-CDT (p=<0.001) and DDST-TDT (p=<0.001). However, there was no statistical difference between CDT-TDT (p=0.207) Conclusion: According to our study results, DDST test was more advantageous than CDT and TDT such as was not require additional financial expenditure and time, and can be easily used in routine laboratories. Therefore, routine monitoring of ESBL with DDST should be determined because of the conspicuous prevalence of ESBL forming and multidrug-resistant of E. coli.

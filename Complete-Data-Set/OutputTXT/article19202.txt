Makale Başlığı: Acute Effects of Different Static Stretching Intensities on Knee Proprioception
Özet: Purpose: Stretching exercise is frequently used in rehabilitation. However, stretching exercises may affect muscle receptors and related joint proprioception. To compare the acute effects of different intensity of static stretching exercises (SSE) on the knee proprioception (KP). Methods: The study included 108 healthy adults (103 Male, 5 Female) aged 18-45 years. Participants were randomly divided into 3 groups.  SSE was applied to the groups for 30 seconds with different stretching intensities (50%, 75%, 100%). SSE was performed on the hamstring muscle of the dominant side with 3 repetitions. KP was evaluated at 20 and 45 degrees before and immediately after stretching of the groups.Results: There was no significant difference in both the intra-group and intergroup comparison results of the proprioception measurements at 20 and 45 degrees before and after SSE, with different severity (p > 0.05).Conclusions and Suggestions: It was determined that SSE, applied at different intensities had no effect on KP.  In this study, the acute effect was evaluated after three types of stretching intensity, and there is a need to examine the acute and chronic effects of stretching applications of different durations and repetitions.

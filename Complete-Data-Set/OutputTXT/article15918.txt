Makale Başlığı: STRATEGIC CULTURAL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE SPEECHES OF CHINESE PRESIDENTS HU JINTAO AND XI JINPING
Özet: The issue of strategic culture is important for both political science and international relations studies. The fact that strategic culture studies have a recent history is also an indication that it is one of the subjects that need to be studied more. This study includes analyzing and evaluating Chinese Presidents Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping's speeches through strategic culture. For the study, the strategic cultural typology was taken as a reference. In this respect, the speeches of the Presidents were evaluated within the framework of four types in the spectrum of strategic cultures: Compromising, Passive Defensive, Active Defensive, and Offensive. In this way, Jintao and Jinping's two speeches in different years were analyzed through the Maxqda program. In this qualitative study, besides the content analysis technique, the Phenomenological approach was also used. The findings obtained as a result of the analysis showed that both heads of state can be both conciliatory and aggressive. This indicated that Jintao and Jinping displayed clear lines in their discourse. Jintao’s speeches had varying qualities according to the situation and conditions. It has been concluded that Jinping’s speeches show a continuity in terms of other categories, although the top priority category changes. The speeches of both leaders in the first period mostly corresponded to the Compromising, and the last-term speeches of the strategic culture categories of the Aggressive type.

Makale Başlığı: Kinesiophobia, Physical Activity, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Levels in Post COVID-19 Individuals: A Cross-Sectional Study
Özet: Objective: Kinesiophobia, inactivity and mood disturbances in post-COVID-19 individuals are poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare measures of kinesiophobia, physical activity, depression, anxiety and stress in post-COVID-19 individuals and healthy individuals.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 25 November 2021 and 30 December 2021. The individuals were recruited from the general community. Kinesiophobia was assessed with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, physical activity levels with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, and mood (depression, anxiety, and stress) with the Depression Anxiety Stress-21 Scale in all individuals.Results: There were 29 volunteer individuals who had COVID-19 with a mean age of 33.41±7.95 years. Healthy controls consisted of 20 volunteers with a mean age of 31.3±7.81 years. Anxiety (55.2% versus 20%) and stress (34.5% versus 5%) were observed more frequently in the post-COVID-19 group. The scores for kinesiophobia and anxiety were significantly higher in post-COVID-19 individuals than healthy individuals (p<0.05). The scores for physical activity, depression and stress were similar between groups (p>0.05). Significant correlations were found among post-COVID-19 individuals for i) the scores for kinesiophobia and stress, and ii) the scores for physical activity, stress, and depression (p<0.05). There was no relationship between kinesiophobia and other outcomes in healthy individuals (p>0.05).Conclusion: Although a high degree of kinesiophobia is observed in both post-COVID-19 and healthy individuals, kinesiophobia, anxiety and stress measures were higher in people exposed to COVID-19 than others. In post-COVID-19 individuals, kinesiophobia increased as stress increased, and physical activities decreased while stress and depression increased. Hence, exercises, physical activities and psychological counseling should be recommended to individuals exposed to COVID-19.

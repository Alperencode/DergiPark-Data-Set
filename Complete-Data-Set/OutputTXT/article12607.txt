Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Reasons for Rehospitalization of Patients with Intestinal Stoma
Özet: Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons for re-hospitalization after discharge in patients with intestinal stoma.Methods: The sample of this retrospective and descriptive study consists of 112 patients who underwent intestinal surgery at the Trakya University Health Research and Application Center General Surgery Service and opened a stoma in a 5-year period between January 2013 and December 2017. A “Data Collection Form” was used to collect the data, which was created by the researchers and inquired about the demographic and health-related information of the patients.Results: Complications developed after discharge in 19.6% (n = 22) of the patients and 31.8% (n = 7) of these complications were peristomal skin complications and 31.8% (n = 7) were dysfunction related to stoma. It was determined that 45.5% (n = 51) of the patients who had stoma surgery were re-hospitalized after discharge and 33.3% (n = 17) of the patients who were re-hospitalized were found to have problems related to the stoma.Conclusion: Patients who undergone stoma surgery were hospitalized again after being discharged due to stoma-related problems that can be solved and prevented with simple interventions. It is recommended that nurses working with stoma patients should take care to inform patients about stoma care and prevention of stoma problems and provide effective nursing care in which they record the care they provide to patients and their results.

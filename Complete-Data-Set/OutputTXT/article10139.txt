Makale Başlığı: HISTORY OF THE BARMA PLATEAU
Özet: This article explores the time when nomadic life started in the district of Of and how much tax was collected from the plateaus. Using the archive documents, it will be revealed when the Barma Plateau, which is the old quarter of Hola-i Kebir villages in the district of Of, was established and where nomadic life is practised, and how far its borders extend. The study, according to the 19th-century kadı writs and chronicles, also highlights the conflicts between the Paçan villagers, who were among the people of the highlands adjacent to the hamlets of Barma Highland, how these conflicts developed, and how the courts established from the highlands to resolve the conflicts. The study focuses on the conflict between the villagers of Hola-i Kebir and Paçan villagers who made herds for their pastures (in Sicanoba Plateau) and how it was resolved. The study also includes discussions of other conflicts that continued along with the Dağardı villagers of Köbrübaşı during the Republican period and the reasons why these conflicts were not resolved. The study reviews which villagers and households were connected to these villages with houses and meadows in Barma Plateau in 1935.

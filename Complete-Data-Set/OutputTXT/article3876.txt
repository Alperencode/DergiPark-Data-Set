Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Telegraph Equations and Track Circuit Equations
Özet: With the use of the telegraph in 1830, great difficulties were experienced in conveying information over long distances. At first, the line drawn between England and France extended over time to England-United States. The raw materials and sections of the cables used in the telegraph line were initially tried to be created by trial and error methods. Based on the discovery of Maxwell's equations, Telegraph Equations emerged towards the end of the 1800s, and equations for communication, information transmission and similar transmission lines were derived from Telegraph equations. Based on the development of technology, signaling systems were needed for railway transportation, which was designed considering the safety of navigation. Track circuits, which are an active part of the railway signaling system, also serve as information transmission lines. With the development of modulation and digital switching methods, seamless track circuits with audio frequency have been developed and the transceiver frequency of the track circuit has increased and it has become less affected by environmental conditions. In this article, the telegraph transmission equations, which are similar in terms of voltage and current leakage, and the information transmission of the track circuit used in railways are examined.

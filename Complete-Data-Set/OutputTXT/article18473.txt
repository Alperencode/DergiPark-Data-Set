Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of calcium hydroxide removal efficiency of different irrigation techniques by microleakage assessment using Computerized Liquid Filtration method
Özet: Aim: To compare the efficiency of sonic irrigation, passive ultrasonic irrigation, and conventional syringe irrigation (CI) in removing pure and injectable calcium hydroxide (CH) from the root canals of mandibular second premolars by measuring the probable microleakage of residual CH particles in root canal obturation using computerized liquid filtration (CLF).Materials and Methods: Eighty instrumented mandibular second premolars were categorized into three experimental groups (n = 20 each) based on the irrigation method used for removing CH and a control group (n = 20) in which CH was not used. Each experimental group was divided into two equal groups (pure and injectable CH). After 1 week, CH was removed from the root canals, and the teeth were obturated. CLF measurements were performed 1 week after obturation.  Nonparametric variables between two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare more than two groups. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.Results: All experimental groups showed higher leakage values than the control group. The highest leakage values were evident in the CI group, and the lowest leakage values were found in the sonic (EDDY) irrigation group. No significant differences were detected among the different forms of CH.Conclusions: None of the analyzed techniques could completely remove CH from root canals, resulting in higher leakage values. Sonic irrigation with EDDY was the best in removing CH from root canals.

Özet: The term Anthropocene, which expresses the impact of human activities on ecosystems, defines the geological age we live in. In the Anthropocene era, many environmental problems, especially global warming and climate change, are seen. Ecological art is a contemporary art that focuses on environmental problems by drawing attention to the importance of the human element. In the study, It is aimed to examine the Ice Text Project carried out within the scope of the Cape Farewell, founded by David Buckland, Terike Haaopoja's Dialog and Mel Chin's Cli-mate projects in line with the explanations of the artists. For this purpose, ecological art literature is explained in the context of the relationship between contemporary art and nature. It has been understood that ecological art projects provide awareness about the causes of global warming and climate change. It is thought that the examination of ecological art projects will accelerate the interaction of science, art and society.

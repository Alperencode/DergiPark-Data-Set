Albeit the Old Turks’ adaptation of a settled life in the following centuries, animals continued to have an important place in their lives, similar to those in nomadic cultures. The Qashqai people part of the Oghuz Turkish branch, either led a semi-nomadic life in the South of Iran, around the Zagros Mountains, or settled down following some reforms in Iran. The main occupations of the Qashqais are animal husbandry and agriculture. Therefore, a close look at their vocabulary established that there are many words related to animals and husbandry. Based on field work, we compiled a database of these words.

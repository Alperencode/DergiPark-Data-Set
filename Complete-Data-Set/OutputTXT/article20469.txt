Makale Başlığı: Comparison of the Effect of Denture Cleansers on Long-Term Water Sorption and Solubility of Polyetheretherketone with other Denture Base Materials
Özet: Objective: In this in vitro study, the effect of three denture cleansers (DCs) after immersion in a chemical solution applied to polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and other denture base materials (DBMs) on long-term water sorption and solubility was compared.Methods: Disk-shaped specimens (50±1.0-mm diameter and 0.5±0.1-mm thickness) were prepared from four DBMs (n=48). All specimens were randomly subdivided into four storage media groups (n=12): Corega tablet (CT), Protefix tablet (PT), 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution (SH), and control (distilled water, DW). Storage media were renewed thrice a day for 120 days and simulated for 1-year use of overnight immersion. Water sorption and solubility (µg/mm3) of DBMs before and after immersion in storage media were examined and obtained data were statistically analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparisons by a posthoc Tukey’s test (p <0.05).Results: From statistical analysis, the effect of different DCs on the water sorption and solubility of DBMs revealed a statistical difference (p<0.05). The PEEK group exhibited a statistical difference in mean water sorption values among all cleanser groups (p<0.05). For the PEEK group, a statistical difference was observed in the DW group among SH and CT groups in terms of the mean solubility values (p<0.05), while a statistically significant difference was not observed in the PT group among SH and CT groups (p> 0.05).Conclusion: DCs affect PEEK and other DBMs in terms of water sorption and solubility in the long-term follow-up.

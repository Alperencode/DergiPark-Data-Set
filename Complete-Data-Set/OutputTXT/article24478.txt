Makale Başlığı: A 16-Year Analysis of Antifungal Susceptibilities of Invasive Candida spp Tested in Our Daily Hospital Routine
Özet: DOI: 10.26650/cjm.2019.43.37Objective: Invasive Candida infectionsoften cause high morbidity and mortality especially in the critically ill orimmunosuppressive patients. We analyzed the species distribution and antifungalsusceptibility data of 1371 invasive Candida strains isolated in CerrahpasaMedical Faculty mycology laboratory over 16 years. Methods: We performed susceptibility testsfor the strains isolated from blood or deep sites and/or from patientsunresponsive to the initial antifungal treatment, and all results wereroutinely reported to clinicians. The tests against amphotericin B (AMB) andazoles were performed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)guidelines from 1998 to 2012 and using Etest from 2012 to 2014. The SensititreYeastOne (SYO) colorimetric method was used to test Candida echinocandinsusceptibility between 2012 and 2014. In this retrospective analysis,resistance or non-wild type (non-WT) phenotypes to systemic antifungals weredetermined by the previous and recently revised CLSI breakpoints (BPs) and bymethod-dependent species-specific epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs),respectively. Results: Overall, Candida albicans was themost commonly isolated species (48%) followed by C. parapsilosis (20%), C.glabrata (12%), and C. tropicalis (12%). The new epidemiological BPs providedby CLSI changed the percentage of resistant C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, andparticularly C. tropicalis isolates to fluconazole (FLZ). Using the ECVs,reduced susceptibility to FLZ was higher among C. albicans isolates (33.4%),whereas itraconazole (ITZ) was higher in C. glabrata (58.1%) than in all otherspecies.  Conclusion: Antifungal susceptibility testsare a key component of the care of patients with invasive candidiasis.Knowledge of local prevalence of antifungal resistance and susceptibilitypatterns might affect clinical decision-making. Cite this article as: Kantarcıoğlu AS,Aygün G.

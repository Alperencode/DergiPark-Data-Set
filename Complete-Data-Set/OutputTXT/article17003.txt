Makale Başlığı: An examination of 1998 social studies textbooks in terms of UNESCO's global citizenship education paradigm
Özet: In this study the inclusion level of UNESCO's global citizenship education paradigm’s which is one of the different approaches in global citizenship education in the social studies (4-5-6 and 7th grade) textbooks prepared according to the 1998 social studies curriculum in our country was examined. Fields related to global citizenship education in textbooks were determined under the guidance of Global Citizenship Education (GCED, (Global Citizenship Education Paradigm) developed by UNESCO. "Global Citizenship Education Review Form" was prepared by the researcher under the guidance of this paradigm. Fields related to global citizenship education in textbooks was determined by document analysis method in line with this prepared form.Content analysis technique was used in the analysis of the obtained data.As a result of the research, it was seen that the social studies textbooks prepared according to the 1998 curriculum do not directly include the concepts of "global citizen", "global citizenship", "global citizenship education". In addition, it has been determined that social studies textbooks support the cognitive and socio-emotional dimensions of UNESCO's understanding of global citizenship education, but do not sufficiently support the behavioral dimension. Another important result of the research is that the information that guides the actions of individuals in social studies textbooks is conveyed without prompting students to think critically. Changing expectations from individuals and society in the globalizing 21st century world requires education systems to adapt to this change. Therefore, it is thought that it would be beneficial for the textbooks of the social studies course, which has undertaken the task of raising responsible and active citizens in primary and secondary schools in the Turkish Education System, to address all dimensions of global citizenship education and what this change brings.

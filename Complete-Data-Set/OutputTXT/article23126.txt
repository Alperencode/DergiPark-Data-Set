Makale Başlığı: On Kamil Miras' Book of “History of İlm-i Fiqh”
Özet: From the beginning of the science of fiqh to the present day, a writing tradition such as recording the historical processes of fiqh is not a coincidence among the science of fiqh and its sub-branches. Especially in the XIX. It can be said that there is a need to write the history of fiqh due to the compulsion of the conditions in the 16th century. We see that various fiqh histories were written by teachers such as Seyyid Bey and İsmail Hakkı from İzmir in order to explain the history of fiqh to the students studying at Darü'l-Fünûn in this field of Ottoman geography. One of them is the work named Tarih-i İlm-i Fiqh written by Kamil Miras, one of the teachers of Darü'l-Fünûn. This book only deals with the jurists of the first three generations and their ijtihads. In the work, Kamil Efendi could not reach the date of fiqh until today. He only gave information about the periods of the Prophet, Companions, and Tabiun, and partly contacted the scholars of the Tebe-i Tabin generation with their works. Despite this, the book is an extremely important study in terms of being one of the first works written in terms of the history of fiqh and containing tidy information. For this reason, it would be beneficial to simplify this work, which was published in old letters, and to bring it to today's scientific world.

Makale Başlığı: A Life-Saving Early Diagnosis of Burkitt Lymphoma Involving both Jaws, Misdiagnosed as Pericoronitis
Özet: Purpose: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive and rare B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In this paper, a rare case of BL, involving both jaws, was presented. Case Report: A 24-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic with the complaint of mandibular and maxillary swelling for two months. He was previously misdiagnosed with pericoronitis and had a history of right mandibular third molar tooth extraction, one-month prior. Intraoral examination showed swelling, ulceration, and spontaneous bleeding in both jaws. Radiographically, extensive osteolytic lesions, irregular periodontal space widening, loss of lamina dura, and peri-radicular radiolucencies were detected. Incisional biopsy was performed from both jaws and the final diagnosis was made as BL. Conclusion: It is crucial to be aware of the clinical and radiological features of this disease by dentists and to consult the attending physician without delay.

Makale Başlığı: SULTAN WHO HAD A SWORD, PENCIL AND ZITHER: MUSIC IN ILHAMI DIWAN
Özet: The Ottoman sultans, who were described as the sultans of the world, were not only busy with state administration and politics, but also were interested in art, literature and music. It can even be said that some sultans were masters in these fields. III. Selim, one of the reformist sultans of the 18th century, also showed his ability in music, calligraphy and poetry. In his period of sultanate, he did not break his ties with music, which he started to take an interest in the cage life during his princedom. The Sultan, who is a master in the style of Talik, was also a poet and his poems that he wrote under the pseudonym İlhâmî are included in his Divan.It is possible to see the influence of İlhâmî's musical knowledge in his poems. He was accepted as a genius in Classical Turkish Music, played ney and tambur, invented maqams and composed. The poet mentioned the timbres of the instruments which are used in our classical music, the feelings evoked by the maqams, the entertainments accompanied by music, and the venues with his own spesific expressions. This paper aims to deal with the issues related to music based on his Diwan.

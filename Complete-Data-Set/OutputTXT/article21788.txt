Makale Başlığı: Flood Social Vulnerability Assessment: A case study of Türkiye
Özet: Among all natural disasters, floods are the most frequent and destructive one by far. Assessment of drivers and quantification of flood risk are crucial for humanity preventing its massive consequences. It is required to combine social and biophysical components of the flood risk so that it is comprehensively evaluated. In this study, Social Vulnerability Index, which assesses the adaptability and sensitivity of population to any hazard, were applied in Türkiye. 9 different parameters were used as a vulnerability indicator based on literature review and data availability. 14 cities were identified as highly and very highly vulnerable. Flood frequencies were determined by numbers of flood events occurred among 1960-2021 in each city. Only 3 of 14 cities (Ordu, Kütahya and Sinop) had the highest Flood Social Vulnerability levels as a result of the combination with Flood Frequency Index. The Flood Social Vulnerability Index analysis showed that only the social dimension of the risk is not enough to evaluate risk itself since the biophysical dimension defines the probability of any disaster to happen. The method utilized in this study can be an effective tool for decision-makers to allocate aids to improve flood preparedness over the country.

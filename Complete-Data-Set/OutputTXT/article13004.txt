Makale Başlığı: JAPANESE LITERATURE AND THEORIES OF LAUGHTER -Shojo No Inori『処女の祈り』Story and Kojiki『古事記』Example
Özet: In this study, the important work of Japanese mythology, Kojiki (古事記), and Kawabata Yasunari's Shojo no Inori 『処女の祈り』(1926) story were evaluated from the point of view of theories of laughter. Laughing acts were detected in both works. It is aimed to reveal the reflection of the act of laughing in the works with the theories of laughter. Thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Kant, Schopenhauer have discussed the subject of laughter. However, there are no comprehensive studies. The most comprehensive study was done by Bergson. Laughter theories are grouped under four headings as superiority theory, relaxation theory, incompatibility theory, and social theory. In this study, as a result of the evaluation of the laughter action, which draws attention in both works, from the perspective of theories of laughter, the opinion that the laughter action in Japanese culture has a divine power has emerged. It has been understood that theories of laughter in Western philosophy and the laughter act in Japanese culture do not overlap.

Makale Başlığı: Tafsir Translations in the Late Ottoman Period: An Evaluation on Tafsîr-i Mavakib
Özet: Translated works emerge in a social, cultural and political environment. Tanslations are handled independently of their social and historical context makes it difficult for us to understand the reasons for their emergence. The subject of the study is the tafsir translations that emerged in the late Ottoman period. In the literature review, it was seen that the Turkish translation tafsirs were generally evaluated in terms of language and style, and the changing social and cultural conditions of the modernization period were not taken into account sufficiently in these evaluations. In this respect, the study aims to reveal the reasons for the emergence and popularity of Turkish translation tafsirs in the late Ottoman period, in particular, in the work of İsmail Ferruh Efendi (d. 1840) named Tefsîr-i Mevâkib. In the final analysis, it was seen that this popularity was mainly related to the institutional, social and political changes of the period.

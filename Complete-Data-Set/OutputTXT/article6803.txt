Makale Başlığı: OPPORTUNITES AND CHALLENGES FACNG FEMALE MANAGERS: A QUALTATVE STUDY
Özet: Women are more disadvantaged than men in terms of representation in managerial positions worldwide. It is questionable how societies that cannot fully offer economic, social, and political rights to half of their population will develop. As seen in many countries, in Turkey, the number of female managers is less than men. Therefore, identifying the factors that prevent women from becoming managers and developing policies to eliminate these obstacles is essential. Thus, achieving gender equality at the management level might be possible. In this study, semi-structured interviews were implemented among 22 female managers who were reached with convenience sampling to learn about their career narratives and experiences during the process leading to management. Findings were interpreted with the descriptive analysis method. On the way to managerial ranks, it was observed that the participants emphasized similar characteristics, such as working devotedly. Several factors making it easy or difficult to become a manager have been revealed. Findings were discussed in the context of gender. It is believed that qualitative research will generate a rich data source for identifying the difficulties and conveniences encountered in this way. The expectation is that such research can provide a roadmap for young women with career goals and contribute to creating gender equality policies.

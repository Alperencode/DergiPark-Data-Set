Makale Başlığı: DESIGN AND THERMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN AMMONIA-WATER ABSORPTION REFRIGERATION AND MICROTURBINE COMBINED SYSTEM
Özet: Integrating absorption chillers in cogeneration and trigeneration systems are beneficial for increasing energy efficiency and sustainability. Those systems have higher efficiency, lower emissions, and lower costs compared to conventional systems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop thermodynamic models to predict the energy behaviour of the system for efficient design. System design and extensive thermodynamic analysis were conducted for a microturbine-NH3/H2O absorption cold and power system. The microturbine with a 60 kW power capacity is the prime mover.14 kW absorption chiller is fed by exhaust gases coming from the waste heat recovery part of the microturbine. The thermodynamic properties of the fluid at various state points were determined. The first and second law efficiency of the system was presented for different design parameters such as evaporation, condensation, generation temperature of the absorption system, effectiveness of the condenser-evaporator heat exchanger, and the solution heat exchanger. The proposed system's energy utilization factor is 28.3%, representing a 43.5% efficiency increase relative to the sole microturbine cycle. In addition, if waste heat from the flue gases discharged from the turbine is not recovered, a tremendous amount of energy may be lost. Therefore, the application of combined energy systems is a vital solution for energy efficiency.

Makale Başlığı: Efficiacy of ivermectin solution against Hirstiellosis in green iguanas- case report
Özet: Interest in green iguanas (Iguana iguana) as pet animals is increasing day by day. Compared to other pet animals, the diagnosis and treatment methods of reptilian diseases are limited. Considering that these diseases will also concern public health, new research is required. Hirstiellosis is a zoonotic ectoparasitic disease seen in green iguanas (Iguana iguana). Recommended therapies are mostly empirical, some of which can be low-impact or toxic. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of ivermectin solution (5 mg/l) in the treatment of hirstiellosis and to provide preliminary data for further studies. Ivermectin solution was found to be effective in the treatment of three iguanas with the aforementioned disease, and no clinical side effects were found in the control examinations made at regular intervals.

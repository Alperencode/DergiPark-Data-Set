Makale Başlığı: SOME CHROMATOGRAPHIC METHODS USED FOR SPECIES DETERMINATION IN MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS
Özet: In this country, meat and meat products are usually considered a value added food product. Because of this, the processes of processing meat and converting it into a product are costly. Imitation and adulterations are committed by some enterprises in order to get more profit and reduce the cost of products by adding cheaper substitutes to high value food products. Due to the fact that pork or poultry meat is comparatively cheaper than the beef, it is often mixed in illegal production of the products made from red meat. Muslim and Jewish consumers have dietary restrictions against pork and its derivatives due to their religious beliefs. In addition, imitations and/or adulterations made in meat products may also negatively affect the health of the consumers with certain allergic diseases. However, it is reported that food adulteration in the meat industry has increased worldwide in recent years, and methods for identifying the species in meat products and the methods for detecting adulterations require high expertise and technical equipment. In this review, the chromatographic methods used to determine imitation, or the species identification in the meat and meat products are discussed.

Özet: The purpose of this research was to examine the inquiry skills of the prospective teachers and their views on the pedagogical competencies of the lecturers in terms of some variables (their gender, program and class level, and academic grade point average), and to determine the relationship between the inquiry skills of the prospective teachers and their views on the pedagogical competencies of the lecturers. Survey model, one of the quantitative research models, was used in the research. The study group of the research consisted of 230 prospective teachers (148 female, 82 male) who studied at the Faculty of Education of Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University in the 2021-2022 academic year, and who volunteered to participate in research. Inquiry skills and pedagogical competence scales were used to collect data in the research. When the participations of the prospective teachers to the inquiry skills scale were evaluated, it was determined that they responded on the overall scale at "mostly" level. When the pedagogical competencies scale responds of the prospective teachers were considered together with its sub-dimensions, it was found that they responded on sub-dimensions of scale and the overall scale at “most are like this" level. Based on this findings, it can be said prospective teachers have inquiry skills above the medium level and think that most of the lecturers have pedagogical competencies. In addition, there were no significant differences in both the inquiry skills of the prospective teachers and their views on the pedagogical competencies of the lecturers in term of their gender, program type, class level, and academic grade point average variables, and the variables didn’t have significant effects on these scales. A positive, low, and significant relationship was found between the inquiry skills of the prospective teachers and their views on the pedagogical competencies of the lecturers.

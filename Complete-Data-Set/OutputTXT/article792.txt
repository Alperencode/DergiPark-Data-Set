Makale Başlığı: THE IMPORTANCE OF POLICY COHERENCE FOR TURKEY’S SUSTAINABLE FOOD SECURITY POLICY
Özet: Sustainable development is at the forefront of the issues that have occupied the world agenda in recent years. Sustainable development debates are generally discussed in the context of environmental problems. The concept of environmental security has become popular because of the increasing interest in environmental problems triggered by globalization and pandemic processes. As a multidimensional concept, there are policies developed by countries for environmental security. However, cooperation between countries has an important role in environmental security, which is a global problem. A number of initiatives have been made in this regard on international platforms. However, global cooperation is not sufficient. In this context, the consistency between the policies implemented by the countries is another important factor. Accordingly, in this study, the measures taken by Turkey regarding food security, which is an element of environmental security, are discussed. Common food security concepts were identified through an analysis of reports from leading institutions.Afterwards, the development plans for these concepts were examined, and it was determined in what context they were used. As a result, it has been determined that there has been an awareness about food security in Turkey in recent years, but there are steps that need to be taken in terms of policy consistency

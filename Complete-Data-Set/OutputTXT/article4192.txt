Makale Başlığı: The Influence of Alternative Methods on Language Skills in German
Özet: Traditional methods used in foreign language teaching until now are not efficient for students and no longer attract students' attention. Therefore, alternative teaching methods were sought that could attract students' attention and improve their foreign language skills. The main objective of this thesis is aimed at exploring the effectiveness of alternative methods of teaching German as a second foreign language on the four basic language skills of students at Anadolu high schools in Turkey. A semi-experimental design method was used in this work. The working group of the study consists of the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group received instruction using alternative teaching methods (community language learning, suggestopedia, foreign language growth and the process writing method). The control group, on the other hand, was taught using the traditional methods (communicative, audiolingual and grammar translation method). The course was conducted two hours a week for six months. At the end of every three months, an academic success test was taken with the experimental and control groups. A total of two measurements were carried out. The data of the study were analysed in a computer environment with the package program SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) 17.0. The t-test was used in the analyses to compare the study and control groups. As a result of the analysis, the experimental group became more successful in reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills than the control group. This article is the result of my doctoral thesis.

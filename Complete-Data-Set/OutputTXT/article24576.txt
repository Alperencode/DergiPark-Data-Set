Makale Başlığı: Gül ü Nevrûz by Kalkandelenli Mu‘îdî
Özet: The fourteenth century Persian poet Celaleddin Tabib  wrote Gül ü Nevruz mathnawi for the first time. Only a  few poets have written this story in our literature. The  first example of the stories belongs to Lutfi, the fifteenth  century Turkish poet who wrote his poems in Chagatai  Turkish in Turkish Literature. Kalkandelenli Mu‘idi (16th  century), Muhibbi (16th century), Abdi (16th century) and  Sabir Mehmet Parsa (17th century) are the poets who  write Gül ü Nevruz in Anatolian Turkish. Of these  names, Muhibbi, Abdi and Sabir’s works came to light,  and several studies have been done on their texts. According  to the modern sources providing information about  Mu‘idi, none of the copies of Gül ü Nevruz written by  him is registered in library records. However, a new copy  has been found recently. This mathnawi was written by  Mu‘idi in 942/1535 to present to Suleiman the Magnificent,  and it was the earliest Gül ü Nevruz written in  Anatolian Turkish; for this reason, it has an important  place in the history of Turkish literature. Another feature  of Gül ü Nevruz is that it contains information which is  not covered in the sources about Mu‘idi’s life. In this  article we will first introduce the new copy of Mu‘idi’s  Gül ü Nevruz and then we will give information about  this mathnawi’s form and content.

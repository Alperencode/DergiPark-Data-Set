Makale Başlığı: Investigation the W-Ir Alloy Schottky Barrier Diodes Performance Using Finite Element Method
Özet: In this study, Schottky barrier diodes, which stand out with their high-speed switching properties in electronic circuits, were investigated using the finite element method. For Schottky contact modeling work, five different alloy ratios like W-at.10%Ir, W-at.20%Ir, W-at.30%Ir, W-at.50%Ir and W-at.70%Ir, pure W and pure Ir metals were used. The numerical model created by using the finite element method was also experimentally verified. Barrier height, ideality factor and series resistance values of Schottky barrier diodes were calculated using forward feed semi-logarithmic current-voltage characteristics, Cheung functions and Norde method. According to the obtained results, it was determined that the work function and barrier height increased by the Ir ratio in the alloying samples. The largest barrier height among alloy diodes was obtained as approximately 1.02 eV for W70Ir/n-Si diode, which has aW-at.70%Ir alloy with a work function of 4.951 eV. In addition, visual graphs were created by simulating the surface electrical potential of the diodes, the distribution of electron and hole concentrations under feed-forward situation. While the current conduction of the diodes took place, significant changes in the distribution of the halls were observed. In this study, the effects of alloying on the working conditions of the Schottky diode were determined by obtaining the parameters that the diodes may have at the end of a possible production process.

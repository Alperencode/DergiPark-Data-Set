Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF URBAN PARKS IN TERMS OF VISUAL LANDSCAPE QUALITY: THE CASE OF ESENYURT DISTRICT, ISTANBUL
Özet: Determining the visual quality of the landscape is a subjective process in which the positive or negative point of view of individuals in terms of aesthetics of natural and cultural landscapes is determined and revealed. This study is aimed to evaluate the visual quality of urban parks in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul province. The study area was evaluated by the students of Uşak University, Faculty of Architecture and Design, Department of City and Regional Planning, using an online photo survey with parameters (n=200). Photographs taken from city parks were examined on a 5-point Likert scale (5 highest-1 lowest) with parameters (naturalness, harmony, scenic beauty, mystery, diversity, vitality, care, trust, openness, and order). As a result, it has been found that naturalness, harmony, care, order, trust, and scenic beauty have a direct impact on the visual quality of the urban space. While the areas with natural landscapes generally have the highest score in terms of all parameters to determine the visual quality, the score values decreased as the artificial landscapes increased.

Makale Başlığı: Zayd b. ʿAlī’s Influence in the Formation of Madhhab’s View in Zaydī Fiqh: Manner of Performing the Ṣalāt Example
Özet: Abstract: In some contemporary publications of a general nature that also give information about Zaydiyya as a fiqh madhhab, Zayd b. ʿAlī (d. 122/740) is mentioned as the imam of the madhhab, and al-Majmūʿ al-fiqhī attributed to him is cited as the most crucial source of the madhhab. On the other hand, recent independent studies on Zaydiyya have made us realize the existence of a widespread understanding of Zaydiism, which does not mean adherence to Zayd b. ʿAlī’s legal doctrine in the Zaydī literature of the later period which the madhhab gained a doctrinal structure like the Sunnī fiqh madhhabs. Our study, which is based on the contrast between these two perspectives, aims to reveal the influence of Zayd b. ʿAlī in the formation of the Zaydī madhhab’s view to understand his position in terms of furūʿ al-fiqh literature. As a method, the differences between his opinions and the muftābih views of Kitāb al-Azhār, which is among the most reliable fiqh texts of Zaydiyyah have been interpreted through the Sharḥ al-Tajrīd by al-Muʾayyad bi-llāh (d. 411/1020) who is one of the essential faqīhs in the formation process of the madhhab. We examined, as examples, the controversial fiqh issues witnessed by every Muslim and attracting attention in the form of ritual prayer (ṣalāt), such as the introductory duʿā (al-istiftāḥ), the state of the hands during the takbīr al-iḥrām and recitation of the Qur’ān (al-qirāʾāt) at standing (qiyām), and the recitation of the duʿā l-qunūṭ.

Makale Başlığı: Logistics and Airline Logistics in Turkey within the Scope of Strategic Planning
Özet: Strategic planning is the methodological, long-term planning starting from small steps to high-level decisions of a country or an organization's goals, resources, roadmap, techniques and tactics in line with its vision where it wants to be in the future and its mission. Logistics when evaluated comprehensively, considering the latest technology and globalization, on the other hand, can be defined as the systematic planning, starting from the acquisition of a good or service, including all activities that may be encountered throughout its life cycle, and execution of all activities beyond the sale or disposal of a good or service. Countries making an effective strategic planning with correct future predictions, taking into account their logistics capabilities and performance, and acting according to the plan, can become an economically powerful, developed country and gain an advantage over their counterparts. Airline logistics, which has been increasing in volume and efficiency in recent years, can also contribute to this advantage. In this study, the contribution of airline logistics in Turkey was investigated by comparing logistics in the world and Turkey within the scope of strategic planning. In the research, the official reports of international organizations such as the World Bank, especially Turkish Presidency and the Ministry of Development along with the official data of other countries were used. As a result, the research shows that logistics is a factor that requires strategic planning rather than a simple cost, it will have an even more important place for countries in the future, with the contribution of the globalization of the logistics network and the tremendous development in information system technologies, particularly the share of airline logistics will increase and logistics will be the new assistant element.

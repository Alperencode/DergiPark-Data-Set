Makale Başlığı: The Role of Social Contract in Kant’s Political Philosophy
Özet: Kant’s views on original contract or social contract seems to be underestimated in the current literature on political philosophy. But, there is a lot to appreciate in his thoughts on this issue. For instance, the original contract being an idea of reason rather than of a historical event, could be considered as Kant’s contribution. Moreover, for Kant, consent to the social contract depends on a moral obligation to institutionalize and make peremptory in a social contract property rights that in the state of nature have only a provisional character. There are aspects which help us purify Kant’s views on social contract from the ideas of Hobbes and Locke; however, his political philosophy is most often claimed to be a part of the social contract tradition which began with Hobbes, and was improved by Locke and Rousseau. We would not be mistaken if we disagree with this claim, since Kant has always noted that an ideal state, or a true republic, must conform to the Idea of the social contract.

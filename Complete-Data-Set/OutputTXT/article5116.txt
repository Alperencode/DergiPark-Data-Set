Makale Başlığı: IDENTIFICATION OF PROPER MIXTURE RATIOS IN HUNGARIAN VETCH (Vicia pannonica Crantz.) + BARLEY (Hordeum vulgare L.) INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS UNDER KAYSERİ ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS
Özet: The present study was conducted to determine the proper mixture ratios of hungarian vetch + barley intercropping system under ecological conditions of Kayseri province. Experiments were conducted in 2015-2017 growing seasons in randomized blocks design with 4 replications.  Beta hungarian vetch and Bülbül-98 barley cultivars were used as the plant material of the experiments. Besides pure sowings, 70% barley + 30% hungarian vetch, 50% barley + 50% hungarian vetch and 30% barley + 70% hungarian vetch mixture sowings were performed. Dry matter yield, crude protein ratio and yield, acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) ratios and relative feed value (RFV) of pure sowings and intercropping systems and vetch ratio in dry herbage were investigated.Present findings revealed that dry matter yields decreased with increasing Hungarian vetch ratios of the mixtures and the greatest dry matter yield was obtained from pure sowing of Barley. However, NDF ratios decrease and protein ratios increased with increasing hungarian vetch ratios of the mixtures. Considering the yield and quality traits (ADF, NDF, RFW, and protein) of two years together, it was concluded that 70% hungarian vetch + 30% barley intercropping system could be recommended for Kayseri province and similar ecologies.

Makale Başlığı: Statistical characteristics, probability distribution, and power potential of sea water velocity in Turkey
Özet: Sea currents have the potential to supply electricity from a renewable energy source to coastal regions. The assessment of the potential energy that could be generated is the first step toward developing this resource. In this study, the data was collected at 5 m and 35 m depths below the sea surface level, including sea current velocity and direction. A detailed field measurement, of the probability of sea water velocity at three stations (Antalya, Silivri, Istanbul) for 5 months is carried out. The sea current power density values in these stations were 10.41, 4.92, and 7.91 W/m2 at 5 m depth, respectively. Besides, average sea current power density values were seen to be closely arranged with 11.44, 4.07, and 9.06 W/m2 at 35 depths, respectively. In addition, statistical analysis applying Weibull and Rayleigh models is also presented. It is shown that the use of a Weibull probability distribution facilitates the analysis of sea velocity conditions and is also able to predict the power density with a high degree of accuracy. The results of this study are useful for the understanding of marine hydrodynamics of these areas, where sea current power projects may be started in Turkey.

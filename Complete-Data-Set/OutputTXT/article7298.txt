The data were collected by using “Data collection form”, “Family Burden Assessment Scale”, “Satisfaction of Life Scale”, and “Self-care Skills Check List”. Results: The correlation results showed that as the children’ self-care skills increased, their mothers perception of family burden decreased (p<0.001) and their life satisfaction (p=0.004) increased. There was also a negative correlaton between mothers’ perception of family burden and their life satisfaction (p<0.001). Conclusion: In this study, it was determined that mothers of children with intellectual disability had high family burden. In decreasing family burden, it is important for families, whose children were diagnosed with intellectual disabled, to receive education in the fields of disability, care and treatment of the child. Key words: Family burden, Intellectual disability, Life satisfaction, Nursing, Self-care.

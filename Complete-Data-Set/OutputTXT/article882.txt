Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Heavy Exercise on Plasma Lipid Levels in Elite Volleyball Male Athletes
Özet: It is known that physical activity plays a cardioprotective role. Various types of physical exercise have positive effects on the plasma lipid panel, which generally indicates the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to examine the plasma lipid levels of elite volleyball players who trained heavily for 10 weeks. Male elite volleyball athletes voluntarily participated in the study, who are healthy and between the ages of 18-35 (n=18). Body mass index (BMI) values were calculated by measuring the weight and height of all athletes participating in the study before and after heavy exercise. Before and after the heavy exercise program, blood plasma samples were taken from the athletes for biochemical and hematological analyzes. When the plasma values of the athletes were compared before and after exercise, no statistically significant difference was found (p>0.05). It was determined that the total cholesterol (TC) value in the plasma lipid panel of the athletes after heavy exercise decreased (p<0.05) and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) value increased (p<0.05)  statistically significantly. There was no difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) values (p>0.05). In conclusion, the increase in HDL-C plasma value and decrease in TC plasma value in elite volleyball athletes after heavy exercise in this study shows that heavy volleyball exercises reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

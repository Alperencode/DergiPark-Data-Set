Makale Başlığı: Tax Veiling in Turkish Tax Law and Social Psychology
Özet: Tax veiling, which is a concept specific to tax law, is considered as the reflection of fraud against law, which is a private law concept, on tax law. By using veiling and forms deemed valid by private law, taxpayers may try to hide the real economic transaction by means of transactions that are in conformity with tax laws in form but contrary to their essence. Tax veiling causes loss of tax revenues of the state and failure to provide tax justice among taxpayers. For this reason, since it is important to examine the reasons for tax veiling and fraud against law at the individual and social level, these issues should be considered in the context of social psychology, where the effects from individual to society and from society to individual are examined together. In this study, tax veiling in Turkish tax law is conceptually examined, and then the reasons that lead taxpayers to apply veiling are evaluated within the framework of psychological social psychology and sociological social psychology.

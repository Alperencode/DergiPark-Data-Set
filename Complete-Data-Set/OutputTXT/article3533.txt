Makale Başlığı: Prognostic Significance  of Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratioinCOVID-19 Infection
Özet: Objective: Serum markers, radiological signs and clinical findings may help guide the assessmentof the prognosis of COVID -19 infection.Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is a cheap and easily attainable inflammatory marker.This study aims to investigate  whether neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is associated with the clinical course of the disease in COVID-19 patients with the non-severe diseaseMaterials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the results of 189 patients who were followed-up at the pandemic clinic of Erciyes University, Medical Faculty Hospital. Patients were categorized according to the criteria released by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health. That guide classifies the patients as mild-moderate and severe.Patients over 18 years of age who were treated with COVID-19 and whose symptoms were not severe were included in this study.Patients who have missing data were excluded from this study. Results: The findings showed that there was no significant difference in hospitalized patients concerning neutrophil-lymphocyte ratiolevels, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count in mild or moderate COVID-19 infected patients at admission and discharge. There was a significant difference in CRP levels between admission and discharge however patients did not progress to a clinical deterioration on the follow-up.Conclusion: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratiolevels did  not change significantly between admission and discharge in mild-moderate patients. In light of previous studies reporting  that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratiolevels are high in patients with severe COVID-19, the present study suggest  that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio levels are a proper marker for predicting the tendency to severe COVID -19 disease in the follow-up of the patients.

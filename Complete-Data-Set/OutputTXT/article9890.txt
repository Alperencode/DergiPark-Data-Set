Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN AID ON INCOME INEQUALITY: THE CASE OF TURKEY
Özet: Foreign aid is provided for underdeveloped and developing countries to reduce poverty and ensure economic development. However, the effectiveness of foreign aid is controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of foreign aid on income inequality. For this purpose, the Turkish economy is analyzed over the period 1989-2019 by employing  ARDL method. According to the results obtained, the increase in foreign aid deepens income inequality. It is also determined that openness positively affects inequality. Additionally, it has been observed that the increase in the real income level induces income distribution to be more equal. In this case, we can say that foreign aid inflow to Turkey is not used for  productive activities.

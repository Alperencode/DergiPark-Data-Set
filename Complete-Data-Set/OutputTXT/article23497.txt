Makale Başlığı: BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE BASIC THEORIES ON THE APPROACH OF THE QUR'AN
Özet: When the Prophettold the Mekka polytheists that he was the messenger of Allah and began to recite the Qur'an tot hem, they asked him for various miracles. These were all emotional miracles. Almighty Allah rejected their requestsandin for med them that the Qur'an would suffice. Infact, the Qur'an was also a miracle. However, what they wanted was not an emotional miracle, but a verbal miracle. They are the Qur'an. While claiming that it was fabricated by the Prophet, the Qur'an asked them to bring a book like the Qur'an, if they were sincere in their claims. The Qur'an continued its defiance. He asked them to bring nazire first to the whole, then to ten chapters and then some of them. However, instead of bringing nazira to the Qur'an, they risked their lives and properties and sent. They preferred to fight the Prophet. Because they were not able to bring nazire to the Qur'an. Although Islamic scholars agreed that the Qur'an is a miracle, they disagreed on the direction of its miracle. Nazzam and a few scholars who thought like him basically claimed that people could make a like of the Qur'an, but were hindered by Allah. Their view was called the theory of Sarfe. Regardless of their denomination, scholars other than these said that the Qur'an is a miracle in terms of wording and meaning. Their view was called the Nazzam theory. Although Said Nursi sees the Sarfe theory as plausible in terms of Allah's hindrance, he became a passion atedefender of the Nazzam theory by saying that the Qur'an is a miracle in forty aspects, and contributed to this theory with his works.

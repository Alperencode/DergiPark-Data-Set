Özet: Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of Fitness (Full Body) and EMS (Electromyostimulation) training on body composition.Material and Methods: A total of 128 volunteers, Fitness (72) and EMS (56), participated in the study. 26.6% of the participants are betweenthe ages of 30 and below, 36.7% of them are between 31-40 years old, 28.9% of them are between 41-50 years old and 7.8% are over 50 yearsold. Participants exercising fitness and EMS (mihabody) trainings in the presence of expert personal trainers, two days a week, for a totalof 4 weeks (8 training sessions). Body composition measurements of the participants were carried out by Bioelectric Impedance Analysis.“IBM SPSS version 21.0” was used for the statistical evaluation of the data. Whole body, leg, arm and trunk measurments, of the participantswere taken prior to and after 4-week training. The data obtained were classified as pre-test and post-test respectively. First of all the preand post test results of the total body, leg, arm and trunk were compared and to perform this comparison Paired Sample T-test was applied.Results: At the end of the study, in both training techniques there is avarage of 2.360 kg loss of total body fat between pre and post teststhis can be considered meaningful with 95% reliability (p<0.05). However, the changes between pre and post test values of the total body,leg, arm and trunk measurements do not differ meaningfully acording to the training type.Conclusion: Therefore, it can be concluded that after 4 weeks, either techniques have the positive effect in body composition and helpreduce the percentage of the total body fat.

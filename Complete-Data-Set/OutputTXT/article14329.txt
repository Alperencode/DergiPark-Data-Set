Chronic low back pain is an important disorder that affects the daily, social, and work-life of individuals. The majority of people experience low back pain at least once in their life. In this sense, it affects both social and economic life. Low back pain can be acute or chronic, depending on the duration of the syndrome. Interventional, medication, rehabilitation, and exercise methods can be used in the treatment of chronic low back pain. In this study, it was investigated which exercise among the exercise models was more effective in the treatment of non-specific chronic low back pain. “Exercise” and “Chronic low back pain” were used as keywords in database searches. As treatment approaches, the effects of Abdominal Hypopressive exercise, Pilates, Yoga, Tai Chi, McKenzie, Gait, Dynamic and Static Stabilization Exercises, Motor Control and Gradual Activity Exercises in patients with low back pain were investigated. It has been determined that all the exercise models investigated reduce non-specific chronic low back pain and positively affect the mental state and quality of life of the patients. The fact remains that, it can be said that Pilates exercises come into prominence more than other exercises in terms of the stated effects.

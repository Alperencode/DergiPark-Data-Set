Makale Başlığı: Administrative Dependence of Environmental Criminal Law
Özet: The aim of this paper is to examine administrative dependence, which is one of the important issues of environmental criminal law. Although there are extensive studies on the subject in German Environmental Criminal Law, there are few studies examining the subject in Turkish law. In this paper, first of all, the necessity of criminal law intervention in the protection  of  the  environment  will  be  discussed.  This  point  is  important  because  it  is  necessary  to  establish  that  the  tendency  toward  the  protection  of  the  environment  only  within  the  scope  of  administrative  law  is  not  appropriate.  The  paper  comprises  the  examination  of  administrative  dependence  within  the  framework  of  the  general  principles  of criminal law; thus, administrative environmental law will not be assessed. The effect of administrative dependence, which  comes  to  the  fore  because  environmental  criminal  law  is  related  to  both  administrative  law  and  criminal  law,  constitutes the main framework of the paper. In this context, the gradation of administrative dependence in terms of the regulation of environmental offenses will be included. To provide the integrity of the subject, the forms of administrative dependence will be examined and the problems arising within the scope therein will be discussed.

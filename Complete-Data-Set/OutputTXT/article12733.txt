Makale Başlığı: The Evaluation of Flipped Classroom Themed Master’s Theses and Dissertations in Turkey between 2015 and 2020
Özet: This research is a case study examining postgraduate theses on flipped classrooms between 2015 and 2020. The universe of the research is postgraduate theses on flipped classrooms in Turkey. The sample consists of 21 dissertations and 62 master's theses, which were conducted between 2015-2020 within the scope of the purposeful sampling method and published in the YÖK National Thesis Center. The theses included in the study were subjected to document review with the measurement tool developed by Demirci, Arıkan, & Onuk in 2018. It is seen that the studies carried out include the steps that should be followed in a scientific research with a few exceptions. The most preferred research method in the method section of the theses was mixed method. When the sampling techniques of the studies are examined, it is seen that purposive sampling comes to the fore. Interviews and tests were mostly used as data collection tools. Although validity and reliability studies were carried out in the majority of theses, the number of theses that do not include those ones cannot be ignored. Most studies on the subject were conducted in 2019 and 2020. This shows us that the concept of flipped classrooms has started to attract the attention of researchers in recent years. As the integration of technology into education accelerates, the interest in technology-based applications such as flipped classrooms will continue to increase and this will show more reflections in academic research.

Makale Başlığı: Treatment of Gingival Recessions Using Coronally Advanced Flap and Connective Tissue Graft: A Retrospective Analysis
Özet: Aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of coronally advanced flap and connective tissue graft (CAF+CTG) in the treatment of gingival recessions (GR).Method: Periodontal records of 32 single and multiple GR in 11 patients treated with CAF+CTG were selected for the study. According to Cairo’s classification, recession type 1 defects were included. Recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were assessed at baseline and follow-ups. Mean root coverage (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) were evaluated. Compliance with supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) was also determined.Results: Mean age of 11 patients was 29.6±4.4 years. The mean observation time of 32 recessions was 37.6±24.2 months. All clinical parameters showed an improvement between baseline and the latest follow-up. After treatment with CAF+CTG, MRC was 92.6±13.1% and CRC was achieved in 75% of the recessions. Compliance to SPT was calculated at 83.3%.Conclusion: The use of CAF+CTG yielded positive outcomes in terms of all clinical parameters and complete root coverage in Cairo recession type 1 defects with a mean observation period of >3 years. The results of the present study confirm the use of CAF+CTG as a gold standard for the treatment of gingival recessions.

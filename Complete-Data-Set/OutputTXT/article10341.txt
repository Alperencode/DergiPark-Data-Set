Makale Başlığı: The Effect Of Unemployment Insurance Regulatıons on Unemployment in Turkey: An Analysis With An Intervention Method
Özet: The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of the unemployment insurance regulations, which started to be implemented as of June 1, 2000, on the unemployment figures. In practice, unemployment figures published by the Turkish Statistical Institute and covering the years 1988-2020 were used. In the analysis part of the study, the Intervention Analysis method was used. In the study, unemployment insurance applications, which started to be implemented since 2000, were added to the model based on the year 2000. When the results of the analysis were examined, it was determined that the effect of unemployment insurance, which was accepted by the law numbered 4447, on the unemployment figures was significant. It was determined that unemployment insurance increased unemployment figures by 15%. When the annual average growth rate of unemployment is examined, it is seen that this rate is 0.03% after the acceptance of unemployment insurance. This result shows that the growth in unemployment figures has increased since the transition to unemployment insurance. This relationship was also found to be statistically significant.

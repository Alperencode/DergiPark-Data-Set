Makale Başlığı: Roy, Oliver. Is Europe Christian. translated by Cynthia Schoch. New York: Oxford University Publications, 2019.
Özet: Olivier Roy, a French political scientist well-known for his studies of political Islam, asks if Europe is Christian in his latest book. Roy presents a wide socio-political spectrum and a sweeping history of Europe from the Great Schism in 1054 to the contemporary period. Although the book does not directly address Muslim immigrants and their issues, Roy’s question ‘Is Europe Christian?’ rises out of the widespread polemical question of whether Islam is compatible with European values. Discussing such compatibility requires answering what European values are. According to Roy, Muslims’ demands in the public sphere sparked a new identity crisis in Europe in the 1990s. This new identity crisis challenged Europeans to rethink religious heritage and belonging to Europe that has been de-Christianized since the 1960s culture wars. Roy traces the relationship between Christianity and European values within this new context. Is Europe Secular is a book with some insights that can benefit those who want to understand the intersection between secularism, Christianity, and populism in modern Europe.

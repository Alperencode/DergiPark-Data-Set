Makale Başlığı: COVID-19 CASES IN MOROCCO: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Özet: Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by novel Corona virus SARS-CoV-2, affecting the whole world. In thispaper, we introduce and apply two iterative methods, RMsDTM and R2KM, to obtain approximate values of Covid-19cases in Morocco. We also compare the approximations of both methods and see that the solution of RMsDTM ismore accurate.

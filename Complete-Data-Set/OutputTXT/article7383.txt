Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF CUTTING LENGTH ON BURR WIDTH IN MICRO-MACHINING OF 316L STAINLESS STEEL PRODUCED THROUGH METAL ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING
Özet: Additive manufacturing, which is one of the basic components of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, has eliminated the manufacturability constraint by manufacturing parts with complex geometry. Additive manufacturing is classified according to the material type as solid, liquid and gas based raw materials. Today, many additive manufacturing technologies are used for metals. In the study, a sample was produced from 316L stainless steel material with standard parameters by selective laser melting method, which is one of the metal additive manufacturing types. Then, burr width measurements were carried out from different cutting distances, including the first, middle and last of the sample, with constant cutting speed, feed rate and depth parameters. According to the obtained results, burr widths (109 µm) are generally low at the beginning of the cutting process. Burr width (372 µm) on the right edge is considerably higher than on the left edge. With increasing cutting distance, it was observed that the burrs (1001 µm) on the left side of the sample generally moved away from the canal edge and were in a horizontal position, while the burrs (539 µm) on the right side were generally in the form of leaning against the side of the slot.

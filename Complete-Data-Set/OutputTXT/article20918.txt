Regression analysis was used to test the research model developed based on the literature.Findings- As a result of the study, it was determined that the dimensions of personalization and assurance, which are the dimensions of perceived service quality in e-commerce environments, have a statistically significant and positive effect on customer satisfaction, but the dimensions of ease of use and responsiveness do not have a statistically significant effect on customer satisfaction.Conclusion- Based on the results of the study, it can be said that the perceived service quality affects customer satisfaction in e-commerce sites.

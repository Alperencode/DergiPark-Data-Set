Makale Başlığı: Esmâü'l-Hüsnâ explanations in Classical Turkish literature and an example of prose with an unknown author
Özet: The term esmâü'l-husna used for the names of Allah includes ninety-nine names of Allah in our culture and belief. As it is emphasized in the four verses of the Qur'an, the most beautiful names are undoubtedly Allah's. In Arabic, Persian and Turkish-Islamic literature, there are esmâü'l-hüsnâ commentaries in verse or prose, in which the meanings of the ninety-nine names of Allah are explained, and the merits and values of counting and memorizing them. The esmâü'l-hüsnâ annotations in Turkish literature are the most important literary genre that deals with Allah after tawhid and munajats and appear in four forms. These; Those who only enumerate and list the names, who make annotations, are of the type of enigma and havass. In this article, after giving information about the esmâü'l-hüsnâ genre in general, a chronological list of poetic and prose works in this genre that can be identified in Turkish literature is briefly introduced. In this way, repetitive information errors related to the species have been corrected for years. Afterwards, a contribution to the genre literature was made by introducing an esmâü'l-hüsnâ commentary, which was not known before and registered in the Istanbul University Rare Works Library, and whose author was not known, and its transcription from Arabic letters to the Latin alphabet.

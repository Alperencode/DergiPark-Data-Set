Makale Başlığı: Awareness of gynecology and obstetricians in Turkey about perinatology specialist job definitions
Özet: Purpose: There is no information about the level of knowledge, opinions, and experiences of obstetricians and gynecologists about the job descriptions of perinatology specialists in Turkey. Our study aims to investigate this awareness by obstetricians and to evaluate their perspectives.Materials and methods: The study was carried out with the participation of obstetricians and gynecologists in Turkey in electronic form between 01 November and 01 December 2021. Participants' academic titles, institutions, and previous employment with a perinatologist were recorded. Multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions were asked to the respondents about which diseases should be followed up in perinatology, who should do the screening tests, detailed ultrasonography, and the management of multiple pregnancies and placental adhesion anomalies.Results: 171 physicians participated in the study. Public physicians said that perinatologists should perform screening tests significantly more than physicians working in the private sector (p<0.05). It was found that the diseases requiring perinatology consultation were significantly less consulted in the group of physicians working in the private sector (p<0.05). Physicians working in the private sector stated that significantly more obstetricians should perform the termination of pregnancies with fetal anomalies when indicated (p<0.05). All groups, except the physicians working in the private sector, thought that perinatologists should do the hospitalization, follow-up, and delivery of pregnant women with placental adhesion anomaly (p<0.05).Conclusions: Our study is the first national study in this field. It has been determined that the duties and responsibilities of the perinatologist are not sufficiently known by the obstetricians.

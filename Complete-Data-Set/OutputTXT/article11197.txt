Makale Başlığı: Legal regulations for the management of wastes from yachts in marina operations and "Blue Card System"
Özet: Yacht tourism is among the most developing tourism sectors in the world and in Turkey. The fact that yacht tourism is in continuous development is positive for the country's economy, but it also brings concerns about the environment. Since marinas are places where more than one environmental challenge meets by nature, it is of great importance in terms of sustainable environment to make regulations and practices to combat these environmental challenges and activities that cause pollution in ports. The fact that most of the marinas are in or close to urban areas increases the importance of waste management that should be applied in these areas.In this study, the legal legislation on waste management of yachts and marina businesses has been examined and the evaluations in various sources regarding the "Blue Card System" developed in this context have been compiled. It is considered that this study will contribute to the literature due to the fact that it reveals the relevant legislation and that there are few studies in the field of the Blue Card System, which is a system that can be considered new.

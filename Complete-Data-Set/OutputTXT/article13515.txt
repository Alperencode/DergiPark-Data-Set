Makale Başlığı: Reviewing the Relationship Between Turkish Teacher Candidates’ Attitudes Towards Writing in Digital Environment and Their Beliefs About Technology Integration
Özet: Different applications in language teaching have emerged based on developing and changing technology. It is impossible to think of writing skills training independently of technology today. If teachers have positive attitudes toward digital writing and technology use, they will be able to direct students properly. For this reason, this study examined the relationship between Turkish teacher candidates' digital writing attitudes and their beliefs about technology integration. The attitude scale for digital writing developed by Susar-Kırmızı, Kapıkıran and Akkaya (2021), and also technology adaptations application scale that was developed by Uluay, Çalışkaner Nibat and Arıkan (2018) were used to collect the data. 146 Turkish teacher candidates studying at Sakarya University were the study group of the research. For the results, the digital writing attitudes of the Turkish teacher candidates are at a moderate level while their beliefs about technology integration are at a high level. Moreover, it is seen that Turkish teacher candidates' digital writing attitudes and their beliefs about technology integration were positively and moderately related.

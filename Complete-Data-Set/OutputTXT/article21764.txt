Makale Başlığı: Determination of insecticide residues in soils from Troia agricultural fields by the QuEChERS method
Özet: Extensive and misuse of pesticides can cause to toxicity to humans and pollution in the environment. The primary objective of this study was to determine insecticide load of agricultural soils of Troia, located in Troia National Park of Çanakkale Province (Türkiye) by the QuEChERS method. For method verification, blank soil samples were spiked at two levels of pesticides. The overall recovery was 84.8% with a relative standard deviation of 13.0% (n = 230), with the values within acceptable recovery (60-140%) and repeatability (≤20%) ranges set by SANTE. Forty-nine soil samples were collected in the study area in 2020. Thirty-six samples had insecticide residues at varying concentrations. Overall, 23 insecticide residues were detected at different frequencies. The most frequent pesticides were: chlorantraniliprole> imidacloprid> pyridaben> clothianidin> indoxacarb (in decreasing order). Mean concentration of insecticide residues in soils varied between 0.99-77.7 µg/kg. Imidacloprid residues were detected in all fields, except cabbage fields. The highest imidacloprid concentration (23.3 µg/kg) was detected in pepper fields. Imidacloprid was detected in 21 samples with a mean concentration of 6.20 µg/kg. Persistent insecticides with the long half-lives, such as chlorantraniliprole, imidacloprid, and clothianidin, were detected in almost all samples.

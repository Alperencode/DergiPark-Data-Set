Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Clinical, Radiological and Functional Outcomes of Surgically Treated Ankle Fractures
Özet: Objective: The ankle is an important joint in the walking function of the body.Surgical treatment is required in cases where displaced and unstable fractures andjoint compatibility cannot be achieved by conservative methods. The main goal ofsurgical treatment is to restore the anatomical position of the talus within the anklefor a normal tibiotalar joint relationship.Methods: 73 patients who were admitted to our outpatient clinics between January2006 and October 2015, who were diagnosed with ankle fracture and underwentsurgical treatment, were retrospectively evaluated and compared with the intactankle.Results: Of the patients who had surgery; Bimalleol fracture in 34 (46.58%),trimalleol fracture in 8 (10.96%), lateral malleolar fracture in 14 (19.18%), medialmalleolar fracture in 13 (17.81%), with posterior malleolar fracture in 1 ankledislocation (1.37%) and 1 had posterior malleolar fracture with medial malleolusfracture (1.37%). According to the Lauge Hansen classification, the most commontype of SER (Supination External Rotation) fracture (14 cases) (19.18%), followedby the second most common PER (Pronation External Rotation) fracture type (14cases) (19.18%). According to the Danis - Weber classification, Type C (21 cases)(52.50%) was the most common and Type B (14 cases) (35.00%) was the secondmost common. When the union time was analyzed according to the fracture type, nostatistically significant difference was observed (p=0.064).Conclusions: If surgical treatment is applied in ankle fractures the length of thefibula should be ensured, rigid internal fixation should be made with the aim ofanatomical reduction of the joint surface, and ankle movements should be startedearly.

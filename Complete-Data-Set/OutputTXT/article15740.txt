Makale Başlığı: Effect of Organic Acid Added Washing Solution on the Quality of Fresh Chilled Sea Bream (Sparus aurata)
Özet: In this study, microbiological and sensory changes of whole sea bream (Sparus aurata) which is one of the important commercial fish species in our country, that were washed in washing solutions which contains different concentrations of acetic and citric acid (2%, 2+2, 4+4 and 5+5) were examined during storage at  +4 °C. According to the results of the research, it has shown that shelf life of washed sea bream were up to 9-10 day by addition of 2% citric acetic acid. The addition of citric and acetic acids together can extend the shelf life up to 12 days. However, it has been shown that high concentration (5+5%) in the co-addition of organic acids cause sensory quality loss of the samples. In this context, it was concluded that the concentration between 2 and 4% for the addition of organic acids in the preservation of sea bream fish is important in terms of preserving the sensory quality of the products.

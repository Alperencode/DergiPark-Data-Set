Makale Başlığı: Calculation of Water Footprint for Wheat, Barley, Sugar Beet, and Sunflower Production in Sivas Province
Özet: Due to reasons such as increasing population, global warming and industrialization, existing water resources are rapidly depleting and the need for water is increasing. All over the world, a significant amount of water is used in agricultural areas. The concept of “water footprint” (WF) has come to the fore in recent years for the correct use of water, which has become more important as a result of the rapid depletion of water resources. Water footprint is defined as the amount of water required to produce a product. In this study, water footprints of wheat, barley, sugar beet, and sunflower produced in Sivas province for 2020 were calculated. With WF calculations, more efficient and correct use of water can be achieved, and the water can be used more sustainably by determining how much water the products need and planting according to the current water situation. As a result of the study, sunflower has the highest total WF value of 4147 m3 ton-1and sugar beet has the smallest total WF value with 113 m3 ton-1. Although the total WF values of wheat and barley were greater than the total WF values of sugar beet, the blue WF values were calculated as 0. This means that rainfall waters are sufficient for wheat and barley production.

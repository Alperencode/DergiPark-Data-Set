Makale Başlığı: Mass Real Estate Valuation of Agricultural Lands with Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis: Example of Mersin, Mezitli-Bozön Mahallesi
Özet: The aim of this study is to estimate closest to market value for agricultural lands in Mersin province, Mezitli district Bozön neighbourhood, which is one of the important centres of Turkey in agriculture. That for, the criteria affecting the market value in the study area were identified and the prices of the agricultural lands for sale or sold were determined. Data belonging to the criteria reached were gathered and arranged in matrix format. The analysis process was started after normalized data. Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, one of the statistical valuation methods, and Artificial Neural Networks, one of the modern valuation methods, were used in the analysis of market values. To determine the best model from the two methods, they were compared with performance analyses which were R2, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error. As the best model, performance results of Artificial Neural Networks were found 0.97; 0.17; 0.03 and 0.01 respectively. In addition, three different value maps were generated with Kriging method by using Geographical Information Systems software. When the value maps are evaluated visually, it has been determined that Artificial Neural Networks are the closest to the market value. This study enabled to be used as a base in the agricultural sector by estimating the value of agricultural lands with objective data.

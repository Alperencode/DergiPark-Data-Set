Makale Başlığı: Examining the Peer Relationships of Students with Specific Learning Disorders
Özet: Purpose: This study aimed to assess the peer relationships of primary school students with Specific Learning Disorders. Material and Methods: 89 students with specific learning disorders and 95 healthy students between the ages of 8 and 14 were included in the study. The Peer Relations Scale was used to examine students' peer relationships. The statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05. Results: When comparing the scores of the Peer Relations Scale, which includes sub-domains of Commitment, Trust and Identification, Self-Disclosure, and Loyalty between the study and control group, it was found that the peer relationships of the students with specific learning disorders were poorer than those of healthy students (p<0.05). Among the subtypes of learning disorders, peer relationships of students with dyslexia were found to be statistically poorer than those of the students with dysgraphia and dyscalculia (p<0.05). Conclusion: According to the results of the study, the presence of specific learning disorders in primary school students affects peer relations negatively. The fact that this study shows that primary school students have poor peer relationships shows that peer relationships should be taken into account in intervention programs that occupational therapists will design in the future. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed on this subject.

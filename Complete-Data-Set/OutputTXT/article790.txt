Makale Başlığı: EXAMINE OF INTERNAL MIGRATION DECISION BY ENTROPY BASED MAIRCA AND SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS METHODS: THE CASE OF TURKEY
Özet: In this study, it has been ranked of provinces in terms of center of attraction of individuals at 81 provinces in NUTS Level 3 of Turkey using the decision criteria related to pull and push factors of migration by the ENTROPI-based MAIRCA method for 2010, 2015 and 2020. The correlation between the ranking of the provinces as centers of attraction and the net migration rate of the provinces was examined, and the spatial contiguity of the migration was analyzed with the bivariate Moran's I test statistic, also considering the spatial effect of the provinces. In other words, the effect of the rank of the center of attraction of the neighboring province on the net migration rate of the province was investigated. In addition, clustering maps of this relationship were obtained. According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that the provinces that are centers of attraction in terms of migration potential in Turkey are the western provinces where the urban population is denser, and the provinces that are behind in terms of being the center of attraction are the eastern provinces with low urbanization. In terms of the criteria weights, the most important factors affecting the cities to be centers of attraction for migration are GDP per capita, wastewater services, number of automobiles, number of hospital beds, animal and plant production values per capita. In the bivariate Moran's I statistic, the net migration rate of a province is also affected by the center of attraction of the neighboring province. In this context, as a variable for spatial contiguity explaining internal migration in Turkey, significant results have been reached for the creation of migration policies, considering that the net migration rate of a province is also effective because the neighboring province is the center of attraction.

Makale Başlığı: Being commoditized of tourist space through reproduction: Mevlana museum and its site
Özet: Mevlana Museum and its site which are among the most important touristic attractions haveconstantly been subjected to change and conversion especially with neoliberal policies appliedsince 1980. The reproduction of the markets which are in the historical city centre hasn’t onlychanged the markets but also changed the tradesmen’s relationship and customer’s attitudes.The change experienced in the social space has reflected the consumption culture and it’sincluded the fund through space and meta. The pattern of phenomenology which is one ofthe methods of qualitative research is used on this research in order to fathom the process occuredduring the research and analyze the results. I had an interview with 10 tradesmen whohave been working in the area for a long time as a sample in order to perceive the change andconversion process. According to the findings of the interview with the participants, the inadequacyof the participants’ numbers on the applied change and conversion caused that theydon’t have the right to comment on it, the process has always remained on the agenda thatit’s turned it into a uncertain situation. The meanings attributed to the space has changeddue to the conversion activities that have been experienced. The usage of “Mevlana” factor asmeta used on the city image and its identity has brought with the commodification due to thespace’s being seen as fund and an important tourist attraction.

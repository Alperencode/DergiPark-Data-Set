Makale Başlığı: Different Methods for Preventing Drought Stress in Some Wheat Varieties
Özet: Our country is rich in agricultural land and plant cultivation is carried out in summer and winter months.  Drought in the summer months adversely affects plant cultivation.  Plants exposed to drought stress can cause decreased leaf expansion, wilting, yellowing of leaves and tissue death (necrosis).  In addition, drought stress causes 92% yield losses in wheat, depending on the growth phase of the plant, the duration of the drought and the increase in the intensity of the drought.  These yield losses affect the producer negatively.  The farmer cannot use water efficiently while growing plants.  This situation causes both cost increase and water scarcity.  With our project;  By determining the minimum amount of water needed by the plant, it was tried to encourage the opening of dry agricultural lands to agriculture.  It was tried to determine the minimum water requirement of the plant for the 1st, 5th and 7th days after drought application to 21-day-old wheat seedlings.  In addition, the effect of proline and liquid vermicompost application on drought tolerance in wheat plants experiencing drought stress was investigated.

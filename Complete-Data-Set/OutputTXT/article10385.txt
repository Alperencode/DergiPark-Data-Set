Makale Başlığı: The Rebirth of Essentialism: William Bagley and Arthur Bestor's Perspectives on Basic Education
Özet: In the historical process, different educational theories have emerged and these theories have affected the education systems of countries. In this process, an essentialist approach has emerged, which describes education as the transfer of cultural values and advocates the transfer of basic disciplines by the teacher. Essensialism, especially in the early 20th century, became an organized movement and turned into a theory as a result of the reactions it showed against the progressive understanding. The progressive education approach criticized by the Essensialists has affected the education system of many countries as well as the Turkish and American education systems. According to Essensialist thinkers, while the standards and achievements of European schools have increased recently, the academic standards of American schools, which adopt a progressive approach and ignore disciplined basic education, have decreased. The aim of this study is to analyze the ideas of William Bagley and Arthur Bestor, who think that progressive and constructivist theories weaken and weaken the education system, and who are considered to be the founders of the 20th century Essentialist approach. In the study, Bagley's views on basic education and his war against the progressive understanding that prioritizes student experience will be examined. In the next process, the disciplined intellectual education approach created by Bestor within the framework of liberal education and his criticisms of the progressive understanding that characterizes education as preparation for life will be analyzed.

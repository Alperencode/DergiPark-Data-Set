Makale Başlığı: SOCIAL AND TECHNICAL REASONS FOR URBAN TRANSFORMATION, THE EXAMPLE OF URBAN TRANSFORMATION IN SARIGÖL-YENİDOĞAN, GAZİOSMANPAŞA
Özet: Increasing migration mobility in Turkey since the 1950s has created squatting, which is one of the important problems in urbanization in our country, as in many developing countries. Population growth as a result of intense migration has led to unplanned urbanization and squatter occupations. The low income level of the population has led to the low quality of the building and consequently the lack of infrastructure, roads and social reinforcements. As a result of urban transformation studies, a more valuable and earthquake-resistant livable healthy environment is created. In this study, the concept of urban transformation, its historical process and the development of Istanbul Gaziosmanpaşa district, the models applied in urban transformation, and the Sarıgöl Yenidogan urban transformation project, which is the first completed urban transformation project of Gaziosmanpaşa district, were examined.

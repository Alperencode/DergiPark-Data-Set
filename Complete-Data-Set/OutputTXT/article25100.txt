Makale Başlığı: Parental Expectation and Religious Education in State Schools in Turkey: The Case of Imam Hatip High Schools
Özet: The goal of education is not only making students intellectually or technically  knowledgeable but also trains them in virtuous settings. This involves not only  building upon the young person’s characteristics and socialization into the norms  of society, but also some deliberate intervention in teaching and learning  environments of home and school to encourage virtuous behaviour and ongoing  moral development. Together with education included values of society, education  is also a way of liberate persons from limitations and impositions of certain beliefs.  Educators’ actions either maintain or challenge the dominant ideology should be  conscious and aim to liberate pupils. The purpose of this study was to seek out the  reasons why parents prefer religious based schools for their children in a secular,  modern Turkish Republic in spite of the fact that there have been more academic  high schools for university entrance. Also the values that parents hope schools to  inject their children have been investigated throughout the study. To achieve this  goal, it focuses on key concerns identified in literature associated with values and  parental expectations, and discussed the current context in Turkey with reference  to the process of de facto situation in the world. As a result, parents included in  this study who preferred to send their children to Imam Hatip High Schools (IHHS)  that are serving mostly religious courses have purposefully in need of religious  courses for their children

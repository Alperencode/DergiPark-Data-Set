Makale Başlığı: A FIGURED OSTOTHEK LID FROM THE ROMAN PERIOD
Özet: This study focused on Ostothek lid  with Lion and woman figure from today's fire brigade department area in the Ilgın district center. This Ostothek lid is made of local limestone with the front part finished. On the lid of the Ostothek, a standing lion figure depicted from the front is seen. When style criticism is made with the likeness of the lion figure on the lid; It is thought that it is designed for protective and frightening purposes. The schematized female figure between the front legs of the standing lion figure is also interesting. Giving this female figure dressed as Peplos vs Himation between the feet of a lion is a symbol that the owner of the tomb is protected from evil and is under protection. The dress folds of the figure, which are given as a superficial relief, provide clues to the find and date of the lid. This find should probably have been brought from ancient settlements near Ilgın. Because this archaeological find in the Ilgin district has close stylistic and iconographic similarities in Antiquity with the female figures of the Mountain Phrygia region. The style and iconographic features that emerged as a result of the comparison made with the similar figures of both the lion and the female figure show that this Ostothek lid belongs to the second half of the 2nd century AD.

Makale Başlığı: A Gender Analysis of the Common Grounds’ Usage in a  Traditional Village’s Labor Life
Özet: The paper aims to examine, in terms of gender, the needs determining the division of labor and subsequently to discuss common working areas as the result of this division of labor. The research developed based on the working life and gender roles of the villagers living in Sivri Dere, Oltu district. The ethnographic method and observation were used as  data collection tools. The research determined places mostly used as common areas and their uses according to gender. Thus, women mostly use dairies, tandoori, ovens, houses, fountains and springs as common working areas. On the other hand, men mostly use flooded places, adjacent areas of the mosque, road joints, pastures, forests, cattle pen, shelters, sheepfolds, crossroads, water channels and mills as common working areas. Trashing areas, on the other hand, are used by both women and men as a collaborative working area.

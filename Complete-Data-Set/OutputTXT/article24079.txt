Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Cinema in the Context of Nationalism: Film Review of "The First of the Few"
Özet: Although art is often criticized for its free nature, it is known that art has been used throughout the history of societies to strengthen the power under the control of power. In order to ensure its legitimacy and disseminate its propaganda, the government needs the media as well as art and artistic products.Art as a means of communication that can cause discomfort over power, and art is trying to be transformed into a means of propaganda with the monopoly of state, while threatening the governments of all periods throughout history. Cinema became a new art field when Cyprus became the colony of Great Britain. The British government also used this newly spread art media as a propaganda tool.This study examines the importance of cinema art in the context of consolidating national feelings and sending soldiers to the war during the Second World War in which England continued its power as a colonial administration in Cyprus. The film "the first of a few" directed by Leslie Howard was studied and the role of British Royal Air Force in the war was transformed into propaganda material by the "Spitfire" aircraft that emerged during the Second World War.

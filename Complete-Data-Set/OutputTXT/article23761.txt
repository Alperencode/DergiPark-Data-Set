Makale Başlığı: Examining Parenting Stress in Terms of Various Variables
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the parenting stress of parents with children aged 0-18 in terms of some variables. The study group of the research consists of 401 volunteer parents with children between the ages of 0-18. The research was designed in descriptive scanning design, which is one of the quantitative research methods. The study data were collected through the demographic information form developed by the researchers and the "Parenting Stress Scale" developed by Aydoğan and Özbay in 2017. According to the results of the research, it was seen that the number of children with parenting stress differed according to the age of their children. It was found that the social support provided by the spouses to each other in taking care of the child and education did not show a significant difference in parenting stress. It was concluded that among the factors related to children, parenting stress was explained mostly by the time and content of children with digital tools, and at least by their children's sleep habits.  The findings obtained as a result of the research were interpreted in line with the literature. Recommendations have been developed for parents and researchers.

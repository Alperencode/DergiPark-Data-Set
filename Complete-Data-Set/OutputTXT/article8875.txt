Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the effectiveness of transabdominal ultrasonographic imaging on the 35th day of pregnancy in determining the pregnancy status and number of fetuses in sheep. 69 Awassi sheep were used in the study. Sheep were mated after oestrus synchronization during the breeding season. On the 35th and 50th days after mating, a pregnancy examination was performed twice transabdominally in each animal by ultrasonography. Sheep with single/multiple offspring were noted according to examination performing on day 35 and lambing record. According to ultrasonography results, early foetal death rate was determined as 6.1%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value ratios for pregnancy examination findings and single/multiple offspring data by transabdominal ultrasonography on day 35 were determined as 91.30%, 100%, 100%, 83.3% and 38.46%, 81.25%, 76.92%, 44.82%, respectively. While the consistency of transabdominal ultrasonographic imaging for pregnancy on day 35 and 50 were high agreement (Kappa=0.864, p<0,001), consistency of single/multiple pregnancy findings on day 35 and at birth were low (Kappa=0,170, p>0.05). The rates of transabdominal ultrasonographic examination on day 35 for correct diagnosis of pregnancy status and the number of fetuses were found as 93.93% and 54.76%, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that transabdominal ultrasonographic examination on day 35 for early pregnancy diagnose in sheep is highly effective in determination of pregnant sheep, and recurrent examination on days 35 and 50 may be useful for detecting of early foetal deaths. In order to determine the number of fetuses, repeated examinations should be performed in the following days of pregnancy.

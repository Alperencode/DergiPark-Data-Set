Makale Başlığı: A Critical Discourse Analysis of a Visual Image in Norman Fairclough’s CDA Model
Özet: Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) has passed through a developmental process, and it has been benefited as a method to study explicitly media texts and talks. CDA provided scholars with a framework to discourses, the characteristics of which are inseparable components of language that influence the outcome of a conversation. In this regard, language, as a form of social practice, appears to be a significant tool of CDA. The purpose of the study is to examine a media text in an image form produced by an anti-gun ownership movement named “Moms Demand Action”. The study aimed to point out the contradictions presented on and through the selected image by referring to Fairclough’s CDA model, which is the analysis at word level, text level and norm level.  This model is very useful when a researcher needs to find out what the addresser wants to convey to the addressee through a text. CDA model of Fairclough consists of three categories, and those categories are called “dimensions”.  Therefore, this study examined an image in three dimensions, and it concluded contradictions at three dimensions.

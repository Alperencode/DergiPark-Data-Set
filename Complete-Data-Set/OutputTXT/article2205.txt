Makale Başlığı: Enhancement Methods of Anthocyanin Stability Enhancement Methods: Phenolic Copigmentation
Özet: Color is the first feature of foods noticed by consumers; It is one of the essential sensory properties that directly affect the acceptance of foods. Although foods have unique colors, there are losses due to external factors such as temperature, acidity, and light during processing. Today, artificial coloring agents are frequently used to preserve the color of foods. Scientific studies have revealed the adverse effects of artificial colorants on health, the number of which is increasing day by day. In parallel with the increasing consumer awareness, the consumption of synthetic dyes is decreasing day by day. Interest in natural color pigments of vegetable origin has increased in recent years. Natural colorants of plant origin, such as anthocyanin, chlorophyll, and carotene, are used in different foods. Anthocyanins are one of the most widely used pigments in the food industry and give foods red, pink, purple, and blue colors. The biggest obstacle to using anthocyanins as food dyes is that they are not resistant to food processing processes. Factors such as thermal processes, pH change, sugar concentration, light, and oxygen limit the use of anthocyanins. For this reason, the stability of anthocyanins is trying to increase by different methods in different processes. Encapsulation, molecular copigmentation, and metal complexes are the most promising methods. In this review, a literature review on the stability-increasing methods of anthocyanins by copigmenting with phenolic compounds was performed, and the results were examined.

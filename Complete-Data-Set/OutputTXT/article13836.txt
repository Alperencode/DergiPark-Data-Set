Makale Başlığı: Organization for Breeding the Horse Lineage during the Second Constitutional Era: The Case of Islah-ı Nesl-i Feres Cemiyeti
Özet: This article focused on the activities of Islah-ı Nesl-i Feres Cemiyeti established in 11 April 1912 under the patronage of the sultan for breeding thoroughbred horse, organizing horse races, and improving riding, following the Second Constitutional Era. In the Ottoman State, pulling force and carrying capacity of a horse had vital importance in terms of agricultural economics and defence. However, there were some problems about breeding and reproducing the horse lineage according to the needs starting from the first half of the XIXth century. Collapse of the timar system and abolition of the Janissaries caused a loss in horse breeding. Despite the establishment of modern studfarms in order to fulfil the military and agricultural needs, this effort was not sufficient. The supply problem and the arrangements for purchasing reached a level that threatened the logistics of the Ottoman army. For this reason, the Ottoman Government started to develop policies for forming a domestic market on qualified horses like the once in European countries. The Government established Islah-ı Nesl-i Feres Cemiyeti in order to organize horse races that were one of the ways enabling breeding the horse lineage in 1912.

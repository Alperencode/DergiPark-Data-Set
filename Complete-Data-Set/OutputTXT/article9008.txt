Makale Başlığı: Radon Exhalation Rate and Annual Effective Dose for Different Rock Types and Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk from Radon Exposure
Özet: Purpose: Radon (222Rn) and its decay products clinging to airborne particles settle in the lungs when inhaled and can lead to lung cancer. The main source of 222Rn is rocks and soil in the Earth's crust and causes indoor radon exposure when local geological material is used as a building material. Accordingly, the primary objective of the study is to determine the radon activity concentrations (CRn) and exhalation rates (EA and EM) from different rock types taken from the Aliağa-İzmir region. The study also estimates the annual effective dose (AED) and the excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR).Material and Methods: For the measurement of the CRn, EA, and EM in different rock types, the can technique with LR-115 detector was utilized. The AED and the ELCR were estimated using the CRn in the samples.Results: It was found that the CRn, EA, EM, AED, and ELCR values for the examined rock samples were ranged between 66±4 and 1711±13 Bq m−3, 51±3 and 1309±10 mBq m-2 h-1, 2.68±0.18 and 64.02±0.47 mBq kg-1 h-1, 1.67 and 43.16 mSv y−1, and 0.006 and 0.151, respectively.Conclusion: The higher radiological risks in terms of radon exposure were related to the rocks of volcanic origin.

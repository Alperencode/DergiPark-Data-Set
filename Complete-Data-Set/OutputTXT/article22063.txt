Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Mushroom Management and Organizational Commitment in Research Assistants: A Study in the Field of Health Management
Özet: Mushroom management style is an approach that is based on the metaphor of mushroom cultivation, where employees are provided only with resources related to their jobs and no other information is shared. This management style affects employees in many ways such as performance, job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The aim of this study is to determine the level of exposure of research assistants to the mushroom management style in their institution and to examine the relationship between mushroom management perceptions and organizational commitment. The population of the study consists of 152 research assistants working in the health management department of public and foundation universities in Turkey. A questionnaire was used as the data collection tool, and the analyses were conducted on the data of 103 research assistants who completed and returned the questionnaires. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the mushroom management perceptions and organizational commitments of the research assistants in the health management department were at a moderate level. In addition, a weak negative relationship was found between their mushroom management scores and organizational commitment scores. Thus, it was concluded that the more positive mushroom management perceptions are, the lower the organizational commitment is. The findings of the study are important for determining the potential effects of mushroom management perceptions at universities.

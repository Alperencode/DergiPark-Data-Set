Makale Başlığı: Root canal morphology of mandibular first and second premolars using cone-beam computed tomography in a selected Turkish-population and literature review
Özet: Objectives: To investigate the root canal morphology of permanent mandibular premolars using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the selected population and to review previous studies regarding other selected Turkish subpopulations.Materials and Methods: The sample for this retrospective study included 1048 CBCT images of 672 females and 376 males representing 1613 mandibular first and 1461 second premolars. Pubmed and Google Scholar were used to search previous literature with selected keywords.Results: The incidence of single root in mandibular first and second premolars was 99.75% and 99.38%, respectively. Complex root canal anatomy was evident in the first premolars compared to second premolars and in males than females (p<0.05). Eight studies have previously evaluated the root canal anatomy of mandibular premolars of other Turkish subpopulations by clearing or CBCT images. The prevalence of 2 or more root canals was found between 5.80% - 39.50% in mandibular first premolars and 1.1% -29% in mandibular second premolars in these studies.Conclusions: More attention should be paid to the detection of additional canals during root canal treatment of mandibular premolars, especially in male patients. The symmetrical morphology of the premolars may guide the practitioners during the root canal treatment. Evaluation methods could affect the results regarding root canal anatomy.

Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of Doğan Kuban's Approach to the "Turkish House with ‘Hayat’" through Contemporary Approaches of Architectural History
Özet: In addition to the physical environment such as climate, geography and materials, which are effective in the formation of traditional residential architecture, social factors, historical and cultural values are among the important factors that shape this formation. Analyzing the traditional house structure from this point of view has gained importance in recent studies, as it sheds light on the historical, social and cultural life processes of the house users in the period. While more monumental buildings were included in architectural historiography at the beginning of the 20th century and before, from the second half of the 20th century, traditional residential architecture began to gain value in architectural historiography. Doğan Kuban is one of the most important representatives of rationalist architectural historiography in Turkey, as he has worked on all periods of the history of Turkish architecture. Within the scope of this study, the work named “Türk Hayatlı Evi”, which was written by Doğan Kuban during these periods in Turkey, will be tried to be analyzed in terms of method. By revealing which architectural historiography approaches that Leach put forward, "Turkish House" will be examined, and their effects on the explanation of the subject in its historical context will be discussed.

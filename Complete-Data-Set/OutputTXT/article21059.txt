Makale Başlığı: ASSIGNING NUMBERS TO FOILS AND FOIL-PAGE MATCHING IN MANUSCRIPTS
Özet: Study with manuscripts has always been difficult. Aside from the difficulty of reaching them, there are also rules to be followed and requirements to be fulfilled in order to benefit from them. Just as recognizing the old script and calligraphy styles is necessary for reading a text, it is essential to paginate it correctly and meaningfully so that it can be used as a reference in scientific studies. Of course, study with literary and scientific works written in the past, only about writing style and editing its pages. Here, we have touched upon the pagination problem, which has really caused hesitation in researchers who have just started academic studies, with a bit arithmetic thinking. We leave it to the works and articles of esteemed masters who have written on this subject to learn about other methods of working with manuscripts.

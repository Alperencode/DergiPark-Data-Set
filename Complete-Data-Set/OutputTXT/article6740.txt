Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMOTIONAL LABOR BEHAVIOR AND JOB SATISFACTION OF NURSES
Özet: Personal characteristics, experiences, perceptions, working environment of nurses, and the attitudes of managers during the delivery of health services affect the relationship between emotional labor and job satisfaction. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between emotional labor and job satisfaction levels of nurses. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional and conducted 151 nurses who agreed to participate in the study. The data were collected between October and December 2019 using "Personal Information Form", "Job Satisfaction Scale for Nurses" and "Emotional Labor Scale". Descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests, Spearman's Rho correlation and Mann Whitney U test were used in the analysis of the data. In the study, it was determined that there was no significant relationship between the Emotional Labor Scale and Job Satisfaction Scale for Nurses total scores (r=0.071; p=0.0389). A statistically significant, weak and positive linear relationship was found between Surface Acting sub-scale of the Emotional Labor Scale and the Pleasant Work Environment sub-scale of the Job Satisfaction Scale for Nurses (r=0.175; p=0.031). Emotional labor behaviors and job satisfaction of nurses affect health care in many ways. The results of this study are stimulating for managers at all levels.

Makale Başlığı: FİRDEVSÎ-I TAVIL'S TECNÎSÂT-I SÜLEYMÂN U BELKÎS-NÂME AND THE ART OF PUN
Özet: Tecnîsât-ı Süleymân u Belkîs-nâme, written by the 15th century poet and prose writer Firdevsî-i Tavîl; is a very voluminous masnavi, consisting of approximately 20.000 couplets, in which various tales of Hz. Solomon and the life story of Belkıs, the queen of Sheba, are handled. Although it is mentioned by Firdevsî in her other works and this information is repeated in various sources, this work has not been reached until recently. Belkîs-nâme was unearthed by a team including us, and studies are still continuing to present the work as a full text to the world of science. Currently, we have two copies of the work, Uppsala and Gotha. The fact that it is written from beginning to end with the art of pun and that it deals with a subject that has not been sufficiently emphasized in our literature, such as the life of Sheba's queen Belkıs, are the features that increase the value of the work. In this study; First of all, the work was tried to be introduced on the basis of its existing copies, then a detailed and new classification was tried to be made by considering the basic sources related to the subject, and finally, all the sub-items of this classification were exemplified with appropriate couplets selected from Belkîs-name.

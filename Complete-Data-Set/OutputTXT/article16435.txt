Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the use of online platform and instructional technologies by primary school mathematics teachers during the pandemic process. In the research, an open-ended questionnaire was applied to 28 primary school mathematics teachers working in the Ministry of National Education. Findings were obtained by subjecting the data to content analysis.  As a result, it was concluded that ZOOM is the most used platform by primary school mathematics teachers, and Z-Book is the most preferred instructional technology in this process. In addition, it has been determined that teachers use instructional technologies to ensure effective learning the most. The expectations of teachers from distance education platforms and teaching technologies can be summarized as being easy to use, adaptable to every subject, offering various materials, attracting attention, being free, having a language option, and having high image and sound quality, apart from accessibility and active students.  Collaboration with parents can be recommended to ensure that every student has access to digital technologies and actively participates in the lesson.

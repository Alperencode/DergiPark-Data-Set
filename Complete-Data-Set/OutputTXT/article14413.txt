Makale Başlığı: Histological Investigation of Bursa of Fabricius and Thymus in Chukar Partridge (Alectorıs Chukar) and Pheasant (Phasianus Colchicus)
Özet: It was aimed to evaluate and compare the primary lymphoid organs bursa Fabricius and thymus tissues of chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) histologically. In the study, three chukar partridges and three pheasants were provided from Süleyman Demirel University Department of Animal Science Poultry Breeding Unit. Bursa Fabricius and thymus tissue samples were taken by dissection. It was performed hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome for general histological examination, and periodic acid schiff (PAS) for the neutral mucosubstance and carbohydrate content, methyl green-pyronin staining for the plasma cells. Van gieson with Weigert's hematoxylin staining was performed for the major cells of thymus. Toluidine blue and alcian blue/safranin O combination procedure was performed to show the mast cells. The sizes of plasmocyte, mastocyte and lymphocyte cells in the cortex and medulla regions of the thymus and bursa Fabricius of chukar partridge and pheasant were measured and their average values were calculated. In addition, photographs of tissues were taken with a Leica DM 500 microscope. When the bursa Fabricius and thymus tissues of chukar partridge and pheasant were compared histologically, it was concluded that there was no significant difference.

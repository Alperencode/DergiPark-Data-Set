Makale Başlığı: Metaphoric Perceptions Of Teachers Towards The “Vocational Working Activities” Concept
Özet: The present study aims to determine the perceptions of teachers regarding the concept of vocational work activities through metaphors. The study was designed as a qualitative phenomenological study. The study group consisted of 83 teachers who received vocational training in 5 different schools (primary-secondary schools) in the central districts of Kayseri at the end of the 2018-2019 academic year. The data were collected in the year-end vocational working activities. Content analysis was used for data analysis. The teachers who participated in the study developed 83 metaphors, 51 of which were different. The metaphors developed by teachers regarding the concept of professional work activities were evaluated in 8 categories. These were determined as; As Useful and Necessary Applications, As Unnecessary Applications, As an Application that Gains Importance According to the Person, As an Application where Participation is Obligatory, As Application Providing Integration, As an Application that Brings Change and Innovation, As a Relaxing Applications and As an Application Providing Guidance.In conclusion, it is thought that the year-end vocational working activities contributed to the professional and social development of the teachers, guided them throughout the new academic year, and allowed them to renew themselves, while they did not serve their purpose and were perceived as boring and useless for teachers when not conducted on a voluntary basis.

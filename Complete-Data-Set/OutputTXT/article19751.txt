Makale Başlığı: Culinary Survivance: Maya Angelou’s Gastrographic Writing
Özet: This article examines Maya Angelou’s I Know Why theCaged Bird Sings (1969), Hallelujah! The Welcome Table: A Lifetimeof Memories with Recipes (2004) and Great Food, All Day Long:Cook Splendidly, Eat Smart (2010) by juxtaposing soul food recipesand memory in the context of black cultural survival, communitybuilding and historical circumstances. In her gastrographic writing,cooking, storing and sharing food within African American culinaryand literary traditions (recipe books, cookbooks and food memoirs)signify a struggle for black survivance (survival and resistance) againstwhite supremacy, discrimination and stereotypical grand narrativesof slavery and Jim Crow years. In this regard, her soul food recipesand cookbooks reflect race, gender and class politics and empowerblack people with the linguistic power of communicating with theircomrades/readers and writing their experiences from the nourishingand safe sphere of kitchens and dinner tables.

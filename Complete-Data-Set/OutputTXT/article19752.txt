Makale Başlığı: Establishing Historical Consciousness via the Historical Novel: Don DeLillo and His Epic Work Underworld
Özet: The objective of this article is to render several definitions ofthe concept of historical consciousness which, as a notion, is a relatively young concept since the early studies on this issue emergedduring 1970s and the major breakthrough came at the beginning ofthe 21st century. Hence, in the light of the recent studies on the natureand significance of this concept and the vanishing boundary betweenhistory and fiction within the postmodern context, the role of the historical novel in the establishment process of the historical consciousness became evident. In this respect, Don DeLillo’s historical novelUnderworld (1997) that covers almost fifty years of the United Sates,is selected in order to exemplify how a fictional text can contribute tothe historical consciousness of its reader. By recreating the atmosphereof the Cold War period, the author presents a multilayered portrayal ofthe second half of the 20th century with its political, cultural and socialagenda.

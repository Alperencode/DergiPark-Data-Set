Makale Başlığı: Inconvenient Truth and Darwin's Nightmare Movies for Environmental Discourse: A Comparative Analysis
Özet: Environmental documentaries have been considered among the prominent forms of expression of environmental concerns for nearly half a century. Although such films serve a shared purpose of drawing attention to environmental problems, they may appear as the distributors of diverse environmental discourses. The present study scrutinized these discourses and the differences between them. Although the relevant literature hosts similar studies, it seems that the previous reseach mostly engaged in making separate analyses of discourses in movies. Therefore, exploring the environmental discourses comparatively through two documentary samples makes the present study unique and significant. The present study selected the documentaries An Inconvenient Truth and Darwin's Nightmare as the sample since they were thought to be significant works of art with different features. The discourses in the films were analyzed theoretically based on Dryzek's reformist and radical environmental discourses. Besides, Van Dijk's critical discourse analysis was utilized in this study. Accordingly, the documentaries were evaluated within six categories: argumentation, rhetorical figures, lexical style, storytelling, structural emphasis on negative behavior, and quoting credible sources, witnesses, or experts.

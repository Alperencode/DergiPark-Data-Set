Makale Başlığı: The Validity and Reliability Study of the Dating Abuse Scale
Özet: Dating abuse, it is a common situation frequently before marriage. A data tool that measures dating abuse is needed to conduct research to determine abuse in premarital dating relationships. In this direction, it was aimed to develop a reliable and valid scale to measure the abuse or the situations that dating abuse is exposed to in individuals between the ages of 18-30. Then, an item pool was formed from the questions thought to reflect dating abuse. There are a total of 82 questions reflecting exposure to abuse and exposure to abuse from the item pool. 275 data were collected from participants aged 18-30 who were in a romantic relationship or had a previous romantic relationship. The data were calculated by explanatory factor analysis method and the subscale of exposure to abuse formed 17 items and 2 factors. These two factors explain 56.6% of the variance. In the exposure scale, which is another subscale, 3 factors consisted of 17 items and it was determined that it explained 51.8% of the variance in total. The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of exposure to abuse, which is one of the subscales of dating abuse, was found to be .915, and the Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of exposure to abuse was found to be .902. In the relationship between the sub-dimensions of the scale, exposure and expose were found to be positively moderately correlated with .466. As a result, it can be said that the Dating Abuse Scale developed to measure dating abuse has reliability and validity.

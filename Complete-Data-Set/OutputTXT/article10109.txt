Makale Başlığı: Traffic Induced Heavy Metal Analysis in Mosses Around the Coastal Highway in the Eastern Black Sea Region
Özet: The aim of this study; To determine heavy metal pollution caused by traffic by using moss around Giresun-Samsun highway. Because of their ability to accumulate heavy metals, mosses are especially suitable to monitor heavy metal airborne pollution. The heavy metal analysis of mosses in the East Black Sea region of Turkey is determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) spectrometry method. A qualitative moss analysis has shown that the samples contained Cr, Fe, Mn, V, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb andCo. While the mean concentration values of Cr, Fe, Mn, V, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb ve Co. in the moss samples collected from city centers are determined 15.12, 6087.31, 301.12, 27.80, 74.20, 38.48, 56.69, 19.40 and 9.10, mg/kg mg/kg, the mean concentration values in the moss samples collected from the city intervals are found 15.56, 4751.23, 247.93, 28.03, 83.71, 33.72, 48.38, 17.20 ve 6.97 mg/kg, respectively. In general, the concentration of Chromium(Cr), Iron(Fe), Mangenese(Mn), Vanadium(V), Zinc(Zn), Copper(Cu), Nickel(Ni), Lead(Pb) and Cobalt(Co), in mosses decreased between 2006 and 2017. However, despite this decrease, heavy metal concentrations in mosses are still high.

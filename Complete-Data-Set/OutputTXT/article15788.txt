Makale Başlığı: Yeni Dini Hareketlerin Psikolojisi
Özet: In this study, the book of psychology of new religious movements by Muhammet Kızılgeçit was reviewed. It is invaluable because it is the first book to evaluate the new religious movements psychologically in the field of psychology of religion. According to the author, new religious movements as a part of social reality stand as a social laboratory and create an opportunity so that people in a religiously regulated, privatized, "bureaucracy-drenched" social order may experience their social relationships in new ways.

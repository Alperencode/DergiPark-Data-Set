Makale Başlığı: Impacts of modern agriculture on environment and sustainable agriculture
Özet: Since the day humans settled down, they have made an effort to transform nature in line with their own wishes and needs. The damage caused to nature beginning with the industrial revolution has been ignored for a long time. The prevailing understanding of development was that nature overcame this situation by cleansing itself. However, it is obvious that the pollution created in nature does not disappear on its own, as it is thought. The agricultural production process, which is considered the most “innocent”, also contributes negatively to environmental pollution. Especially fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides used in industrial agriculture cause serious damage to the environment. The study aims to deal with the duality of the environmental pollution caused by agriculture and the effects of environmental pollution in agriculture. Sustainable agriculture practices may reduce environmental pollution and enable a sustainable development in terms of agriculture.

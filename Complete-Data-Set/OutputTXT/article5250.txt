Makale Başlığı: Study on Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activities of Salvia microstegia mericarps from Turkish flora
Özet: AbstractBiofilm-associated infections cause important health problems all over the world. Because of the resistance to antimicrobials and their possible side effects, researchers' attention has been focused on plant extracts and their components. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of Salvia microstegia Boiss. et Bal. mericarps. The antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract obtained from the mericarps was evaluated using the microdilution method against seven standard bacteria and three standard yeast strains. In addition, the effect of the extract on inhibiting biofilm formation and preformed biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined using the crystal violet method. The used extract showed moderate to low antimicrobial activity against tested bacteria and yeasts with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from  62.5 to 250 µg/mL. Moreover, the extract's potential to inhibit preformed biofilms was found to be greater compared to its potential to inhibit biofilm formation. In conclusion, the tested extract obtained from Salvia microstegia mericarps showed antibiofilm potential, however, additional studies involving different strains are needed to reveal its antimicrobial potential in a more holistic perspective.

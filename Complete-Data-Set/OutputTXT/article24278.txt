Makale Başlığı: Partial quadriceps tendon transfer for revision medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction: a new surgical technique
Özet: Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction for patellofemoral instability is a common procedure. Although MPFL reconstruction is a successful procedure in terms of return to normal life or sports, revision cases are challenging due to previous holes into the patella or implants placed in the anatomical femoral insertion site. In this technical note, the use of a partial quadriceps tendon transfer to the adductor magnus tendon is presented as a good solution for revision cases to avoid the use of implants, bone drilling, use of allografts, or two-stage surgical procedures. In addition, this procedure could be also used as a primary procedure in skeletally immature patients. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0245This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: CONTROLLABLE CLEANING ROBOT WITH BLUETOOTH THAT CAN DETECT  OBSTACLES
Özet: With the advancement of technology, the place of robots in our daily life has increased. In this study, a robot that has been developed by combining Arduino Uno R3 and various sensors, which will provide convenience in daily life, has been developed. The aim of the study is to make household chores that have become routine easier with the help of technology. For this purpose, a robot is designed that travels inside the house, draws dust with a fan, and wipes the floor thanks to the cloths placed on DC motors. A new Algorithms have been used to ensure that the robot can continue its task without getting stuck when it encounters an obstacle during the wiping and sweeping process. The system also includes a Bluetooth module that will provide manual control of the user. At the end of the study, people will be able to easily perform floor cleaning jobs without tiring themselves and having to be at home. It can clean more precisely than different models offered for sale at high prices in the market. However, it is thought that it will be preferable because of its low cost. As a result of the further development of the prototype, it will be able to serve home users as a result of changes in size. The cleaning frequency of the robot is presented by detecting the right areas and working performance analysis.

Makale Başlığı: Does the Use of Fish Oil Supplements Prolong Benign Pediatric Epistaxis?: A Case Report
Özet: Fish oil is a widely used reinforcer for children by families nowadays due to its many structural and functional benefits. Although its positive effects on children’s mental development have been demonstrated widespread in some studies, there is no clear view about the necessity of its use in childhood. Besides the side effects of this promising supplement have not been fully illuminated, its use may cause susceptibility to bleeding, as mentioned in many different literature studies. The present case is a remarkable presentation of a prolonged benign pediatric epistaxis caused by fish oil, often preferred among supplements and used for children today. The patient’s condition improved significantly following the discontinuation of the reinforcement (fish oil). We submit our case to emphasize that the use of such products should also be subject to a standard assessment, based on our clinical experience. We suggest that only physicians decide to initiate fish oil in patients who needed it; more importantly, we also consider that they must monitor them closely as it can have side effects.

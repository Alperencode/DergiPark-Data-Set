Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Postoperative Cutaneous Findings in Rhinoplasty Patients
Özet: Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the post-operative presence, clinical severity and course of acnevulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis among rhinoplasty patients.Material and Method: Fifty-six patients who were planned to have rhinoplasty were administeredeither pored or non-pored plaster cast for one week in the postoperative period. The patients in therhinoplasty group were randomized into four groups according to the application of pored or nonporedplaster cast and adhesive strips for a further one-week. Forty patients that had undergoneclosed technique-septoplasty were included in the control group. The self-assessments of the patientsin the rhinoplasty and septoplasty groups were recorded in terms of acne, seborrhea and erythemavia visual analog scale (VAS). The clinical severity of acne vulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis werecompared via Global Acne Grading Score (GAGS) and Seborrheic Dermatitis Area and Severity Index(SDASI) in both groups at postoperative months 1, 3 and 6.Results: In the rhinoplasty group, the VAS acne, VAS seborrhea, VAS erythema, GAGS, and SDASIvalues increased significantly at postoperative month 1 and decreased significantly at postoperativemonth 6 compared to the pre-operative values. At all visits, the GAGS values of patients that hadundergone rhinoplasty were found statistically significantly higher than those that had receivedseptoplasty. At postoperative month 6, the GAGS values were significantly decreased in the grouptreated with non-pored plaster cast and adhesive strips for one more week. The SDASI valuesstatistically significantly decreased only in the group treated with pored plaster cast. However, at allvisits, the mean values of GAGS and SDASI were similar in the four rhinoplasty groups according to thedifferent types of plaster cast duration of nasal bandages.Conclusion: We concluded that in post-rhinoplasty patients, the plaster cast type and duration ofnasal bandage application do not affect the severity of acne vulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis.

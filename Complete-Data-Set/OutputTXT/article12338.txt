Makale Başlığı: STANDARD POSITION PRACTICE AND ITS EFFECT OR INEFFECTIVENESS ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS: TURKISH BANKING SECTOR
Özet: An important and recent regulation "standard position", that aims to economic using of public resources and to complete and orderly execution of public services, still continues to be implemented. Among its objectives there are some quantitative and qualitative ones. Upon these objectives; standard position aims in one hand, to maintain the satisfying public service and, on the other hand to use the public resource in economic productive manner. Especially for maintaining the satisfying public servicing, well-balanced staffing activities is needed. Although the standard position is essentially designed for public institutions, it is sometimes seen that it is adopted in private sector enterprises also probably because of productivity and economic contribution expectations on the profitability even though this contribution is indirect. In fact, private sector enterprises, which are expected to be much more flexible and act faster than private sector enterprises in terms of staff arrangement and restructuring, probably adopts the standard position since economic and profitability expectations. Therefore, the question whether the norm staff practice really contributes to the economic goals of the organizations or not becomes an important question. This study has been prepared to evaluate whether the norm cadre practice contributes to the economic goals of organizations by analyzing the all commercial banks in Turkish banking sector whether they have reached higher employee productivity and lower “fully loaded cost”. It is revealed that the standard position has no any significant effect on dependents variables.

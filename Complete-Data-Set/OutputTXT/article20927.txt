Due to the difficulty of obtaining data, the use of only EU and USA data is a limitation in the study.Findings- As a result of the independent samples t test, no statistically significant difference was found between the number of accidents in the EU and the USA. Conclusion- There was no significant difference between the two groups as a result of the independent sample t-test applied in line with the purpose of the study. The reason for this is that the two groups have similar characteristics in terms of education, qualified workforce, technology and economic power.

Makale Başlığı: DIGITAL MANIPULATION 'DEEPFAKE' TECHNOLOGY AND THE COGENCY OF THE NONEXİSTENT
Özet: The era we live in is in which hybrid life practices manifest themselves with the integration of new communication technologies into objective life with physical participation. This era, in which social media, which is the founding element of both virtual and objective reality, is an alternative to objective reality, also includes the development of artificial intelligence algorithms in which objective reality is reconstructed in virtual reality. The effectiveness of artificial intelligence in new communication technologies is especially evident in content production and distribution processes.Deepfake technology is an output that has the capacity and abilities to learn, imitate and even manipulate the abilities of living objects by using deep learning algorithms of artificial intelligence technology. This technology, which was first used by malicious online actors in 2018, while adding visual and semantic differences to the art of cinema, is mostly used for deep frauds in digital spaces. Digital spaces offer digital identities the freedom to hide and move freely, which they cannot find much in physical living spaces. While these facility and opportunities offered by digitalization to its users also cause technologies such as deepfake to be used more in online areas, it also reveals deep problems that point to perceptual inconsistencies such as circulating the content created with these technologies in digital spaces and questioning the truth.The study focuses on the effectiveness and usage of deepfake technology in digital spaces. The effects and results of this technology, which is used extensively especially in the social media content production process, on digital identities are discussed in detail within the scope of the study.

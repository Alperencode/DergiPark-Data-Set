Makale Başlığı: Is bolus norepinephrine dose as affective as ephedrine in preventing spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in cesarean delivery?
Özet: Objective: Spinal anesthesia is the preferred technique in cesarean delivery. Hypotension is the most common and concerning adverse effect (>80%) if no prophylaxis is given, which is major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity. Current literature suggests that vasopressor therapy is mainstay in prevention and management of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension. Here, we aimed to compare the effects of prophylactic intravenous ephedrine and norepinephrine boluses on hypotension incidence in elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Materials and methods: The study included 62 term pregnant women (ASA II) with baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90-140 mmHg who were scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Ephedrine (10 mg, IV bolus) and norepinephrine (6 µg, IV bolus) were given simultaneously with spinal induction in group E and N, respectively. Hypotension was defined as SBP below 90% of baseline value (10% decrease from baseline) and respective agents in each group were given at same doses for treatment.Results: Hypotension incidence was comparable in group E and N (64.5% vs. 74.2%, respectively). Severe hypotension (defined as SBP <80% of baseline) incidence was 32.3% in both groups. Tachycardia incidence and attacks were significantly higher in group E (p<0.01). Umbilical vein pH values was significantly higher in group E than group N (p<0.05). Fetal acidosis (defined as pH<7.20) was observed only in one newborn from group N. Conclusion: Prophylactic ephedrine and norepinephrine IV boluses showed comparable efficacy in preventing and treating spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension. Both agents failed to decrease hypotension incidence.

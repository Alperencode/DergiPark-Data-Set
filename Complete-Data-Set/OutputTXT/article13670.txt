Makale Başlığı: READING THE NOVELS OF “1984” AND “BRAVE NEW WORLD” ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE
Özet: Art and architecture have always influenced each other, with their ever-evolving scopes. Therelationship between art and architecture, which can be interpreted in many ways, has been read throughliterary works within the scope of the research. In this direction, two dystopian works named “1984” and “BraveNew World” were determined as the material of the research with their literary value and their characteristicsof being a qualified data source on the subject. The fact that these works contain predictions for the futureand that they convey these predictions through contrasts such as “real-virtual” and “natural-artificial” have alsobeen a factor in determining the works in question as research material. The works were analyzed with themethod of content analysis and interpreted through the similarities and differences between the branches ofart that they created in our minds and the discipline of architecture.The main purpose of the research is to examine the relationship between art and architecture and to search forthis relationship in two selected works of science fiction literature. With the content analysis method, inferenceswere made on the concepts used to describe art and architecture in both works. As a result of the analysis, it hasbeen determined that the disciplines of art and architecture are related in various aspects such as the feelingsthey evoke and the concepts they represent. In addition, it has been concluded that architecture has roles inscience fiction literature such as conveying future predictions, conveying the concepts and messages to beemphasized to the reader.

Makale Başlığı: Flood Susceptibility Analysis of Çankırı Central District Based on Geographical Information Systems
Özet: With the increase of human-induced effects on the earth, natural events such as floods and floods reach the disaster level and cause many loss of life and property. This situation will increase the size of the disasters experienced/will be experienced, especially with the human-induced climate change process. In this study, it was aimed to determine the areas with high flood risk in the central district of Çankırı. For this purpose, geographic criteria, whose matrix values were calculated using the Multi-Criteria Decision Method, were analyzed with the Weighted Sum method in ArcGIS software. The findings were explained, discussed and interpreted with the help of maps, satellite images and land photographs. According to the findings, 1.8% (25.9 km²) of the plains close to the river in the central district of Çankırı are very high; It is seen that 16.6% (239.3 km²) of it has a high flood risk. It has been determined that one of the areas where flood risk is intense is Çankırı district center. It is thought that as a result of meteorological and hydrological factors developed due to reasons such as deterioration of the river bed capacity, planning at the level of the slanting bed, especially in the Çankırı district center, the stream will leave the slanting bed and cause many loss of life and property in the floodplain. Establishing settlements in areas with high flood risk in the research area will turn the situation experienced with sudden and high precipitation from being a natural phenomenon and turn it into a disaster.

Makale Başlığı: A Case Developing Bigemina Ventricular Extrasystole After Moxifloxacin-Induced Anaphylaxis
Özet: Anaphylaxis is a multisystemic hypersensitivity reaction that develops suddenly after exposure to an allergenic substance, and causes life-threatening circulatory and respiratory problems if the intervention is delayed. Anaphylaxis is often caused by drugs, insect bites, and food. In case of anaphylaxis, dysrhythmias may be observed as a result of cardiac side effects. In our case, we presented a patient who developed anaphylaxis and concomitant ventricular dysrhythmia after the sixth dose of moxifloxacin tablet, a quinolone antibiotic for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection.

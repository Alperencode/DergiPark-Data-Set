Makale Başlığı: The Effect of New Ecological Paradigm On Socially Responsible Consumption Behaviour in the Covid-19 Era
Özet: In this period when the pandemic is experienced and the world is shaken, the necessity of owning the values related to nature and the sustainability of human life draws attention, while the issues related to raising awareness in consumption have led to a focus on socially responsible behaviors that represent higher values about the human-environment relationship and inclusive beliefs about the world we live in. To determine the effect of the new ecological paradigm on socially responsible consumption behavior in the Covid-19 period, the new ecological paradigm scale which aims to measure people's worldviews in order to reveal the theoretical side of an ecology and the socially responsible consumption behavior scale were used as data collection tools in this study. The research is relational quantitative research. The main mass of the research consists of 479 consumers living in Istanbul. The data of the research were collected by using the easy sampling method and the online survey technique. The suitability of the data within the scope of the research for factor analysis was examined, and the structural equation model was used to measure the effects between variables. It has been observed that the balance of nature, anti-exemption, and anti-anthropocentrism independent variables, which are sub-dimensions of the new ecological paradigm, are associated with socially responsible consumption behavior at significant levels in the Covid 19 period. It was found that the sub-dimensions of ecological crisis and ecological borders did not affect socially responsible consumption behavior.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Ayancık Stream Basin and its morphometric parameters
Özet: As a result of the increase in the negative effects of climate change, many natural disasters such as drought, forest fires, and floods are experienced all over the world. In Türkiye, especially in the Black Sea region, floods and overflows are frequently seen due to excessive precipitation. The use of current data obtained from the land management information system in the disaster management information system increases the accuracy of the predictability of disasters and ensures their sustainability. For this reason, the accuracy and up-to-date data obtained from the land management information system are important. Storage, modeling, querying, analysis, and tracking model has created for local and private administrations thanks to the acquisition of data by remote sensing and photogrammetry methods and their integration with GIS. Thus, natural disasters caused by the negative effects of climate change can be prevented. It is necessary to model the basin in terms of geological, geomorphological, and hydrographic and to create a basin management model, especially to predict, monitor, and take precautions for flood and overflow events. In this study, the boundaries of the Ayancık Stream Basin, which is located on the Sinop Plateau and flows into the Black Sea by mostly flowing in the north-south direction, were determined and morphometric analyses of the basin were made. With the help of morphometric analysis, the hydrographic features of the Ayancık Stream Basin were determined.

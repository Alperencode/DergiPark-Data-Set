Makale Başlığı: Lichen Cleaning and Epigraphic Analysis of a Group of Tombstone in Ahlat Square Cemetery
Özet: Anatolia, which has become a cultural mosaic by hosting different cultures from the first ages of history until today, presents its beauties like an open-air museum with concrete examples with the richness of these differences. Every nation that has dominated these lands, which has been the cradle of civilizations, has built works reflecting their own culture and traditions. Every civilization has wanted to show its strength with military buildings, safe trade with commercial buildings, social welfare with civil structures, glorify religion with its temples, and show its deep respect for the dead and belief in the hereafter with monumental tombs and tombstones. Tombstones, which are historical documents belonging to the period they were made, are encountered in many settlements in Anatolia. The most qualified and monumental gravestones in our country are found in the Square Cemetery in Ahlat. The witnesses and sarcophagi in the Ahlat Square cemetery, which is considered to be the largest historical cemetery of the Islamic world, have survived to the present day, despite all the negativities. These tombstones, which arouse deep respect and curiosity in those who see them despite the restrictive conditions in religious and physical plan with a highly developed aesthetic understanding, are the most important historical and cultural heritage that should be preserved.In the 2020 excavation season, lichen cleaning and inscription analysis of 60 grave witnesses in Ahlat Seljuk Square Cemetery were carried out with the support of the Turkish Historical Society. Considering prominent factors such as tombstone typologies, decoration and writing among 60 gravestones unearthed, 10 gravestones were evaluated in this study.

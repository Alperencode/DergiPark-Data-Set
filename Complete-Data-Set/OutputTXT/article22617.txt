Makale Başlığı: Presentation of Issues Related to the Doomsday and the Hereafter in the Qur'an with a Dialogue Style
Özet: Language is the most important element that enables communication with people. A uniform style is not used when conveying a message to the addressee. Because the situation of the target audience differs. Since the Qur'an is a book that appeals to human beings, it did not use a uniform narrative style while conveying its message to the target audience. According to his place, he conveyed his message with the styles of questions, sacrament, shouts, descriptions and hivar (dialogue). It is seen that the Qur'an uses different styles in matters related to the Doomsday and the Hereafter. One of these frequently used styles is the chivar (dialogue) style. Dialogues sometimes take place between the people of heaven, sometimes between criminals, and sometimes between two groups or between them and angels. Again, dialogues appear in the form of a bilateral dialogue or a one-sided monologue. With this study, the following questions were tried to be answered: 1-Why was the Khivar style used so much in the Qur'an? 2-Which type of (khivar) dialoge was used and what are the characteristics of the used khivar style.

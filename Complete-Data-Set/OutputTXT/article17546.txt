Özet: The International Izmir Festival is one of the most important and comprehensive art festivals in our country and it has been contributing to the art life of city and country in many ways for years. In this study, assuming that festivals make a great contribution to the spread of art events in our country, it is aimed to examine the art branches of the events, the places and districts of the events, the music types of the concerts and the performers of these concerts. For this purpose, a descriptive survey model was used to comprehensively examine the situation. In this context, all the festival programs of the International Izmir Festival, which took place between 1987-2022, were sourced and examined by document analysis. Frequency and percentage distributions, which is a descriptive statistical analysis, were used in the analysis of the obtained data. The International Izmir Festival was established in 1987, and the research finds that a total of 356 events were performed in the genres of music, dance, theatre, opera and musical arts. Festival events featured in 36 different locations and most of them were determined to be among the cultural heritage sites of Izmir. The events were mostly organized in Selçuk, Konak and Çeşme districts. 264 concerts have been organized in the festival from past to present and in these concerts, classical music is the most common genre of music, while band music is the least common genre. Finally, it has been concluded that the number of foreign performers participating in the festival is more than local and mixed performers.

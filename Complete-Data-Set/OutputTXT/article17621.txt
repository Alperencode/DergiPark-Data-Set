Makale Başlığı: The efficacy of regional analgesia techniques in urological robotic surgeries: a retrospective clinical study
Özet: Objective: The advantages of robot-assisted surgery include shorter incisions, less postoperative pain, perioperative blood loss, and a faster return to daily functions. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) provides highly satisfactory analgesia in abdominal surgery. However, its hypotensive effect, particularly in minimally invasive procedures, exceeds its contribution to rapid recovery. Fascial plane blocks may be more beneficial in that context. This study evaluated the effects of regional analgesia techniques in robotic prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy operations.Material and Methods: Following IRB Ethics Committee approval (2021.467.IRB1.134), the records of patients who had undergone robotic prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy surgeries were retrospectively reviewed between January 2018 and January 2022. Results: One hundred and forty patients with full documentation were included in this study. Various regional analgesia methods were used. Fascial plane blocks were seen to be used in addition to epidural analgesia. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) and rectus sheath blocks exhibited satisfactory results in robotic prostate surgeries and TAP blocks in robotic nephrectomy operations.Conclusion: In robotic prostatectomy and nephrectomy operations, we recommend fascial plane blocks as the first-choice method for postoperative analgesia.

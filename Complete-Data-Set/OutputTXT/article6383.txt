Makale Başlığı: FORMATION MECHANISMS AND REDUCTION STRATEGIES FOR POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS IN MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS
Özet: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds formed as a result of cooking meat and meat products at high temperatures, and the most common way of exposure to these compounds is dietary intake. Many factors such as cooking method, cooking temperature, cooking time, fat content of meat are effective on the formation of these PAH compounds, which occur in high amounts in meat and meat products. The adverse effects of this organic contaminants on health have led to the development of strategies to reduce the formation of these compounds in foods. Approaches to reduce PAH formation include reducing the cooking temperature and time as much as possible, using alternative cooking methods, marination, changes in the chemical composition of meat and meat products. In this study, it was aimed to explain in detail the mechanisms of PAH formation in meat and meat products and the strategies to reduce its formation level.

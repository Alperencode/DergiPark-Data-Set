Makale Başlığı: Determination of some quality parameters in Horoz Karası grape variety
Özet: In this study, some quality elements of the Horoz Karası grape variety were investigated. For this purpose, cluster, berry, total soluble solids (TSS), titration acidity, pH level, berry color, total phenol, and antioxidant activity were determined in sample clusters of the Horoz Karası grape variety taken from the producer vineyards in Kahramanmaraş. In the Horoz Karası grape cultivar, total soluble solids (TSS) level was recorded between 16.6-25.35%, titratable acidity between 0.189-0.517, pH level 3.62 and 3.94. In Horoz Karası grape samples, L*, which expresses brightness, was determined between 25.64 and 29.97, a* value between 0.32-1.33, b* value between -0.91 and -0.23. Chroma value was recorded between 0.43-1.85 and CIRG (Color Index of Red Grapes) values were between 7.02 and 8.25. Hue angle was recorded between -40.88 -        (-33.31) values in CIE (Commission Internationale de L'éclairage) color coordinate. According to the Hue angle values, the color of the berry of the Horoz Karası variety was recorded as purple.

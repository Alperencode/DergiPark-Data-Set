Makale Başlığı: Chemical composition of the essential oil of Thymus longicaulis C. Presl. subsp. longicaulis
Özet: In this study, the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from the aerial parts of Thymus longicaulis subsp. longicaulis naturally grown in Turkey were analyzed by GC and GC-MS and chemical differences in terms of chemotaxonomy were discussed. The main compounds in the essential oils of T. longicaulis subsp. longicaulis essential oils were 1,8-cineole (30.1%), linalool (18.0%), β-pinene (17.3%) and (E)-β-ocimene (%12.6%) Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed by examining essential oil studies of 34 samples belonging to the genus Thymus, including the Sinop sample. The results of the study were discussed with other taxa belonging to the genus.

Makale Başlığı: CULT-ART IN OLD TURKS IN THE CONTEXT OF RELIGION-ART RELATIONSHIP INTERACTION
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to reveal the cult formations in old Turkish societies and their effects on art from the ground of religion and art/craft relations. Before the explanation in question, the meanings of the terms religion and art/craft were discussed by making concept archeology. The concept of religion resists being defined in terms of both human experiences and literature; but it concerns a phenomenon that remains one of the most important insights into existence. The concept of art/craft also has its own difficulties in definition, at least as much as religion. For this reason, it is essential that these two pairs of concepts are taken to a certain level and explained. The first aim of the study is that the phenomenon of religion is a social phenomenon, the second is that the separation of art and craft expresses a historical break, and finally, the third, that the relationship between religion and art / crafts finds a basis in cults through symbols, and how various cults in old Turkish communities are reflected in art / crafts is the emphasis.

Makale Başlığı: What Is A Eschatology Transmission Story: Special Of The Transmission “Worshiping In Time Of The Civil War Is Like Emigration To Me”
Özet: There are transmissions in many sources of traditions expressing what should be done in times of the civil war/tribulations/eschatology. In this study, the answer to the following question was sought: ‘Does the mention of the concept of herc, tribulations/eschatology or melâhim in any transmission show that it is absolutely within the scope of the eschatological literature?’ In this direction, the transmissions that "العبادة في الهرج كهجرة إلي" is based on; as a result, this transmission, which includes the word "هرج" or "فتنة" is actually not directly included in the scope of tribulations/eschatology, and it has been seen that the Prophet made the art of simile while saying this. Therefore, it can be stated from this point of view that the compilers didn’t act correctly when placing the transmissions to compose a chapter. So, the transmissions should not be handled directly through words/concepts, but also with the background of the transmissions.

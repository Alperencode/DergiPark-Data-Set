Scanning method was used in the research. Within the scope of this research, a 26-item, five-point Likert-type Secondary School Teachers' Digital Content Preparation Self-Efficacy Scale was developed. The scale has 11 items with factor loads between 0.569-0.876 on the 1st factor (digital communication), 6 items with factor loads between 0.643-0.735 on the 2nd factor (table and graphic), on the 3rd factor (teaching materials) with factor loads between 0.676-0.878 It was composed of 4 items and 5 items with factor loads between 0.617-0.780 in the 4th factor (social content). The cronbach alpha coefficients of the sub-dimensions of the developed scale were calculated as 0.945, 0.925, 0.908 and 0.863, and the overall reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.956, and it was concluded that it was reliable. As a result of the research, it can be said that a valid and reliable scale with 26 items, 4 sub-dimensions, 5-point Likert type, was obtained.

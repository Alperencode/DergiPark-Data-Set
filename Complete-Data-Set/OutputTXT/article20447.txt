Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF INTER-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT IN COREPERIPHERY RELATIONS
Özet: Institutional economics approach reveals that institutions are essential in increasing social welfare bycomprehensively addressing social and economic life. At the same time, institutional economics approachproceeds similarly to the problems discussed in the development literature. This study evaluates thedevelopmental differences between countries in core, semi-periphery and periphery countries according toinstitutional quality differences. In the first part of the analysis, the core (upper and lower), semi-periphery(upper, middle and lower) and periphery (upper, middle, and lower) country groups were determined bythe club convergence method using the data between 1990 and 2017. The second part of the analysis teststhe institutional approach that explains the development differences between countries for eight countrygroups. Findings have revealed the effect of economic freedom on development in all subgroups of core,semi-periphery, and peripheral countries. In addition, while the effect of democracy on development hasan increasing effect in core and semi-periphery country groups, the results in peripheral countries arefound statistically insignificant.

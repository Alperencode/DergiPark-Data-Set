Makale Başlığı: The names of the musical instruments in the Turkish translation of Shota Rustaveli’s Poem “The Knight in the Panther’s Skin”
Özet: Shota Rustaveli’s poem “The Knight in the Panther’s Skin” is an epic poem containing medieval lyrical passages. The poem is distinguished by a variety of musical instruments. Our article deals with the issue of translating the most commonly used musical instruments in the Turkish translation of “The Knight in the Panther’s Skin “. Using empirical material, source and target texts have been compared to understand how adequately the musical instruments are translated in the Turkish translation of “The Knight in the Panther’s Skin “ performed by Bilal Dindar and Zeynelabidin Makas. Our goal is to investigate the principle of selection of equivalents and evaluate its adequacy. In this article, we will discuss the most commonly used musical instruments, which can be grouped as follows: String instruments - Chang, Eban, Barbuti, Chaghana; Wind instruments -Buki and Na; Percussion musical instrument -Tsintsilani; Drums - Noba and Nobati, Kosi, Tablaki. In many cases, these musical instruments have the corresponding words in the Turkish language, however, the translator does not translate them into the target language. Based on the comparison of the texts, we will empirically determine the proximity of the source text and the translation text.

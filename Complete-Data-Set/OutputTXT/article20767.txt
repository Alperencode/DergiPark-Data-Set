Makale Başlığı: A REVIEW ON THE PROBLEMS OF CONTRACTED STAFF IN THE PUBLIC STAFF MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THE CASE OF HIGHER EDUCATION CREDIT AND DORMITORY INSTITUTION
Özet: With the proclamation of the Republic, the Turkish bureaucracy was aimed to achieve a rational and merit-based system. For this purpose, various legal levels have been implemented, civil service has been legally guaranteed, and it has become a high-status profession. The influence of bureaucracy and civil service on society has increased with welfare state policies. With the New Right and New Public Management approaches that emerged in the 1980s, it was desired to control the bureaucracy by weakening it. In order to prevent negative externalities such as budget deficit, confidence deficit and performance deficit, which are created by the traditional public administration approach, it is desired to place a contracted employment and human resources management approach in public personnel management. With the Presidential Government system, it was aimed to reform the structure and to establish a public personnel regime based on human resources management. However, the necessary legal regulations for reform studies could not be implemented, and a staff structure that works in more than one status and according to legal regulations has emerged in the public sector. The promotion exam announced by the Credit and Dormitories institution affiliated to the Ministry of Youth and Sports represents the reflection of these problems in practice. It is seen that the personnel working in more than one status within the institution cannot attend the promotion exams due to the deficiencies in the legal regulations.

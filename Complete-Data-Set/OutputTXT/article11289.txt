Makale Başlığı: THE DISCURSIVE LEGITIMATION OF THE EU-TURKEY REFUGEE DEAL IN EUROPEAN POLITICAL DISCOURSE
Özet: This study explores the legitimation strategies employed in European political discourse on EU’s migrationcooperation with Turkey. More specifically, this paper elucidates factors that shape argumentation inEuropean parliamentary debates on 18 March 2016 EU-Turkey Statement, also known as the EU-TurkeyRefugee Deal. Adopting an interdisciplinary research methodology rooted in Critical Discourse Analysisand using analytical tools of Cognitive Linguistics, this study aims to provide empirical insights into thelegitimation of migration and asylum policies. This study connects to the growing body of literature ondiscursive legitimation in an attempt to extend the existing set of categories of legitimation proposed inearlier studies.

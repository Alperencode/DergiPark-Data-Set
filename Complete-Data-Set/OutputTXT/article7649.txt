Makale Başlığı: Clinical Characteristics and Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index Levels in Elderly People with Dementia Living in A Nursing Home
Özet: ge,  gender,  family  history,  low  education  level,  hypertension,  diabetes,  hyperlipidemia, smoking, alcohol and vitamin D deficiency are thought to be potential risk factors for patients with dementia. In addition, malnutrition is common among dementia patients. Therefore, we aimed  to  evaluate  the  clinical  characteristics  and  Geriatric  Nutritional  Risk  Index  (GNRI) status  of  elderly  individuals  living  in  a  nursing  home  diagnosed  with  dementia  alongside those  without  dementia.  A  total  of  150  elderly  individuals  aged  60  and  over  living  in  an Istanbul   nursing   home   in   were   included   in   the   study.   Demographic   characteristics, comorbidity  status,  and  biochemical  parameters  were  obtained  from  their  own  files.  In addition, the GNRI status of elderly individuals were calculated. The mean age of patients with dementia is higher than those without (p <0.05). The number of illiterate elderly (41.3%) was higher in those with dementia (p <0.05). The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) and serum glucose, ALT, and albumin in the elderly were significantly lower in those with dementia (p <0.05). When GNRI valueswere compared, those with dementia were at a higher risk than those without (70.7%, 33.3%, respectively). Findings call for a multidimensional assessment of the health status of elderly individuals living in nursing homes.

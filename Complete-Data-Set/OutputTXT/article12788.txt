Makale Başlığı: The Investigation of the Effects of Compaction Method on Different Types of Recycled Aggregates
Özet: In recent years, the recycling and reuse of construction and demolition wastes have become increasingly important due to environmental concerns and economic reasons. In this study, the effect of the compaction method on the compaction of different construction and demolition wastes in order to build a filling was investigated. Accordingly, firstly, five different debris wastes were converted into granular filling material and their physical properties such as water absorption were determined by laboratory tests. After that, compaction tests were carried out on these waste aggregates using separately falling hammers and vibrating hammers. Besides, sieve analyzes were conducted before and after the compaction tests, and so the disintegration of the particles according to the compaction method was investigated. These tests were performed on a type of natural aggregate to compare waste aggregates. As a result of the study, it was observed that the water absorption values of the waste aggregates were greater than the limit values, and also the brick-based waste aggregates were caused to more increase water absorption value. It was also put forward due to the fact that compacting the waste aggregates with vibratory rammers will be beneficial as it will reduce the degradation of the particles.

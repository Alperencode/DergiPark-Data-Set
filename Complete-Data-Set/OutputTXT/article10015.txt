Makale Başlığı: Molecular Characterization and Assessment of Population Structure of Hulled Wheats
Özet: Analysis of genetic diversity among genotypes and differentiation among populations are crucial for determination of conservation strategies and one of the best plant breeding approaches. In this study, ISSR markers were used to determine genetic variation and population structure in 23 hulled wheats. Together with control durum wheat and bread wheat registered cultivars, 32 wheat genotypes were analyzed with 14 ISSR markers located throughout the wheat genome. Number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 13 and the polymorphism information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.27 for the UBC-852 to 0.37 for the UBC-824 with an average of 0.33. High levels of polymorphism ratio (100%) were observed for ISSR primers. Mean number of polymorphic alleles (N), expected heterozygosity (He), PIC, number of effective allele (Ne), Shanon’s information index (I) and genetic variation (FST) were determined as 10.21, 0.42, 0.33, 1.78, 0.61 and 0.63, respectively. UPGMA analysis based on dice genetic similarity ranged between 0.981 and 0.112 showing the high genetic diversity among hulled wheat genotypes. Results showed that the ISSR markers provided reliable and reproducible fingerprinting profiles for assessment of population structure and genetic diversity of hulled wheat genotypes. These molecular variations obtained from present study can be used in parent choosing for breeding studies.

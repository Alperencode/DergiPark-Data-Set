Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of long-term lung capacity of children who ingested corrosive substances by spirometry
Özet: Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the long-term lung capacities, measured by spirometry, of patients who had developed esophageal stricture due to the ingestion of corrosive substances and underwent repeated esophageal dilatation.Method: Patients who had ingested corrosive substances between January 2014–May 2021 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 1: Control n=23), Group 2: Patients who do not require dilatation after the ingestion of corrosive substances and who are completely healed (n=9), and Group 3: Patients who developed esophageal stricture due to the ingestion of corrosive substances and who underwent dilatation (n=9). FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and FEF 25-75 parameters were recorded for evaluation. Results: The difference between FEV1 (p=0.02) and FVC (p=0.01) values for Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant. The difference between FEV1 (p=0.02) and FVC (p=0.01) values was not significant between group 2-3 (p>0.05). Also, there was no significant difference between FEV1/FVC (p>0.05) and FEF 25-75 (p>0.05) in any group. Conclusion: No long-term negative effect was found on the lung capacities of any patients as evaluated by spirometry.

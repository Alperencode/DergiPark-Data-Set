Makale Başlığı: A Comparison Study in Terms of Dimensional Accuracy and Precision Of 3D Modeling
Özet: In this study, the differences in the dimensions of the 3D models produced by Polyjet and FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) methods as Auto surface modeling (ASm) and Parametric modeling (Pm) were investigated. Here, our purpose is to demonstrate the effects of the modeling methods on the dimensional accuracy and precision. A component having cylindrical, plane and amorphous surfaces have been selected as a sample material. Polyjet and FDM methods have been used in 3D printer using the nominal data of this component. Then a 3D scanner have been used to scan those aforementioned parts. These scans have been remodeled with two different modeling methods, namely, ASm and Pm. After modeling, the measured (scan) data has been compared with the nominal data. Differences in terms of the size of the results were revealed mathematically. According to the results obtained, when we compare the parts produced by Polyjet by ASm and Pm methods, we observe that ASm gives better results all over the surface than Pm. Also the former one has less maximum error norm than the later one. On the other hand the samples produced by FDM using both ASm and Pm give better results all over the surface, but  the former one has relatively less maximum error norm than the later one.

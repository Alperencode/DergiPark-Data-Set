Makale Başlığı: Insight of previous parental sport engagement among competitive swimmers in Kenya
Özet: This study sought to establish the relationship between sport involvement of parents and children’s involvement in swimming. The study was descriptive and exploratory in nature. Former (N=148) and active swimmers (N=394) responded to the questions as to whether their parents were involved in any sport, and whether their parents supported their participation in competition. More parents of active swimmers (86.3%, N=340) participated in sports, compared to 64.9 % (N= 96) among former swimmers. Specifically, more fathers (75.1%, N=296) of active swimmers were involved in sports compared to mothers (45.9%, N=181). Among former swimmers, there was minimal difference between fathers (N=66) who participated in sports compared to mothers (N=64). Previous parental sporting involvement had significant influence on active swimmers at p= 0.001. Parents act as role models and pass on their beliefs, supporting their children in endeavors that they value.

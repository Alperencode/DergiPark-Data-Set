Makale Başlığı: FUNCTION OF MEMORY AND COPING WITH TRAUMA IN JULIAN BARNES’S THE NOISE OF TIME
Özet: In the Noise of Time, Julian Barnes portrays the life of the Russian composer, Dmitri Shostakovich through his three traumatic encounters with the Soviet regime. These three events, namely Shostakovich’s opera being criticised by Pravda, the regime’s propaganda agency; his being forced by Stalin to attend a conference in New York and support the Soviet regime; and finally, the composer’s becoming a member of the Soviet party under the political pressure, cause irredeemable scars in Shostakovich’s mind. With each traumatic experience, the traces of the previous incident re-emerge and lead Shostakovich to a both physical and psychological downfall by haunting the composer’s mind. Throughout the novel, Shostakovich pursues a self-conflict regarding the anxiety he suffers by remembering fragments from his childhood, youth, and recent past. Through this process, his music and the ironic attitude he assumes towards the events around him serve the composer in overcoming the difficult times he goes through. Irony helps him to keep his sanity under the political oppression, and his music helps him not to lose his hope for the future in the time of an oppressive regime that threatens his career, his family, his physical and psychological condition. In his novel, Barnes explores an individual’s, especially an artist’s despair, his struggle for survival and for preserving his hope by shedding a light on Shostakovich’s mind. In this respect, this article aims to discuss how memory functions in recounting the traumatic experiences of Shostakovich in Julian Barnes’s the Noise of Time and how his art, along with his inclination to irony, helps the artist survive in the time of oppression.

Makale Başlığı: Jewelry and Trade in The Crusades
Özet: The Franks, who met the ancient civilization of the East through the Crusades, became rich with the jewels of Syria, Egypt and Byzantium. Before the Crusaders came to the region, the region where the expeditions of Iran and India, which also had a jewelery history, passed, was also a productive period in which valuable works written on this subject were copyrighted. Syria and Egypt, the crossroads of Eastern civilization, attracted the attention of the Crusaders with their jewelery richness. Crusaders, who became rich with trade as well as the booty they captured, started to wonder about countries such as India and Iran, where the jewels came from, over time. In this period, besides those who bribed precious jewels to save their lives, those who contributed to art with jewelery work added a special importance to this issue. The jewels worn at the weddings shed light on the social and political life of this period, and the rulers who were keen on wearing jewels, besides the brightness of that period, caused the weakness in the state administration. While the obtained jewels caused some people to become rich, they revealed the frustration of others. With the spread of trade over a wide area, jewelery merchants also showed themselves, while the Egyptians and Jews were leading in the East, this privilege was generally reserved for the Italian city-states in the West. The Crusaders, who were expelled from the Syrian and Palestinian coasts in 1291, later XVI. century, they discovered new routes and became rich with the diamonds of regions such as India and Brazil, and much later, Africa.

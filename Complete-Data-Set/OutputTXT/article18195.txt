Makale Başlığı: Nano Formulations as Drug Delivery Systems
Özet: Classical drug forms are used frequently and in repeated doses. Undesirable situations may occur when the dose used for the concentration of the active substance released into the system falls below the sufficient amount or rises above the toxic level. As a result of the developments achieved in nanotechnological research, nanoparticles, which have many applications in the clinic, have made a significant impact in the pharmaceutical industry. The practical use of nanoparticles in applications such as direct binding to the active substance, entrapment and targeting in the pharmaceutical industry has made nanoparticles a preferred position. When implanted systems with nanocarriers reach the target area, uptake in organs, tissues and cells increases. These structures use active and passive targeting strategies to deliver the active substance to the targeted cells. The use of nanocarriers in drug delivery systems provides many advantages. The results obtained from the studies carried out so far are that, thanks to the targeting of cancer drug-loaded nanocarriers, treatment alternatives with higher selectivity have emerged. In this study, nanoparticles as drug delivery are discussed and how to increase bioavailability with nanoparticles is discussed with their advantages.

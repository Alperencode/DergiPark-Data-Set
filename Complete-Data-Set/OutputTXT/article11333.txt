Makale Başlığı: Gould-Hopper Based Degenerate Truncated Bernoulli Polynomials
Özet: In this study, we consider the truncated degenerate Bernoulli polynomials based on the Gould-Hopper polynomials and examine diverse properties and	formulas covering addition formulas, correlations and derivation property. Then, we derive some interesting implicit summation formulas and symmetric	identities. Moreover, we define Gould-Hopper based truncated degenerate Bernoulli polynomials of order rr and give some of their properties and	relations.

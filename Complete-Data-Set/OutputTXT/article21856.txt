Makale Başlığı: THE DEVELOPMENT OF TURKISH CARPET ART
Özet: Carpets, which were first used in Central Asia by Turks for protection from extreme hot and cold in their tents, were used by the Ottoman Empire during festivities and military expeditions. Being indispensable items in the Ottoman palaces, carpets have always been objects of interest for the Western world. Turkish carpets are the most important ones among the Turkish goods that have been exported since their period in Central Asia. Western artists picturized Turkish carpets as a sign of wealth and reputation. It has been emphasized that a person who was painted together with a Turkish carpet would have a high status within the society. The subject of this work is the development and samples of Turkish carpet.

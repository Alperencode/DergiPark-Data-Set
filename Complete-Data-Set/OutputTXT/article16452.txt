Makale Başlığı: An Assessment on the Published Geographic Literature on Urban Transformation
Özet: The aim of this research is to evaluate the geographical researches in the field of urban transformation in the national and international literature in topic and methodological context. The research was designed with a qualitative method and document analysis has an important place in shaping the study. While scanning the literature, key concepts were searched in national and international databases. According to the first findings in the examined literature, geographers’ tendencies towards the subject in the international literature can be based on an earlier date, while in the national literature, it has been understood that it coincides with a period close to the present. While urban transformation practices in the national literature focus on the socio-spatial elements in the land, the gentrification phenomenon that occurs as a result of urban transformation draws attention in the international literature. From a methodological point of view, it has been determined that the studies prepared with the qualitative research method and case study pattern stand out in the examined works.

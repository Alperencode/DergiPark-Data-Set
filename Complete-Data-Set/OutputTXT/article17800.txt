Makale Başlığı: Geology and Active Tectonics Properties of Zilan Geothermal Field (Erciş-Van )
Özet: Development of Eastern Anatolia under the influence of active tectonics has continued from past to present.  As a result of active tectonism and volcanism, there is a high geothermal potential in the region. In recent years, the geothermal resources of Western Anatolia, whose geothermal potential has been defined; energy production, housing/city heating, thermal tourism, greenhouse cultivation etc. provide a wide range of uses. However, Eastern Anatolia (EA) geothermal resources have been used only for thermal tourism purposes and small-scale greenhouse studies at the local scale. To date, approximately 23 geothermal resources were identified in the Eastern Anatolia Region. The some studies indicate that there is a relationship between the points of hot water sources and fault lines. Hot waters reach the surface along these fracture lines and are located parallel to the fault line. There are approximately 11 hot water points along the NE-SW trending Erciş-Zilan-Ilıca valley and their arrangement is approximately parallel to the valley extension In this study, the relationship between the geothermal resources in the region and the Zilan Fault has been tried to be revealed. The locations of hot water points were determined by RTK-GPS and faulting data were collected by field studies along the valley. According to the data obtained, it has been understood that the Zilan Fault, which may affect the Erciş region and its surroundings, is a NE-SW trending left lateral strike-slip active fault and controls the deformation of the Zilan geothermal field in the region.

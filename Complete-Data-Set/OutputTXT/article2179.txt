Makale Başlığı: Experimental İnvestigation of Tenons with Different Penetration Depths and Diameters
Özet: Shelter is one of the basic needs of human beings. Masonry structures have met this need since ancient times. Masonry structures have an important place among the building types. It is also under construction in many rural areas. Since protecting historical structures is among our most important duties, we need to know the repair and strengthening methods and methods of such masonry structures, and to be able to apply the best to that structure. Metal fasteners (clamp and tenon) are used in the repair and reinforcement of masonry structures. Although it is known that these metal fasteners will contribute positively to the structures, it is not known how to use them in the most effective way. This study presents experimental studies aiming to find the most effective use of tenons, which are metal fasteners connecting vertical units in historical buildings. Variables in the experimental study were the tenon diameter and the tenon penetration depth into the stone. In the experimental study, it will be tried to determine which variables will be used in order to obtain more positive results with anchorage (tensile) experiments. It is exciting that this experimental study, which aims to find the most effective use of fasteners that have been used for centuries and still continues to be used, is the first of its kind. In addition, due to the subject of this study, it is thought that it will be an example for future studies.

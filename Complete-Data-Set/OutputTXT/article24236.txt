Methods: Firstly, National Thesis Center database was searched for orthopedics and traumatology. The theses, which their summary or full text were available included in the study. Theses were evaluated according to topics, study types and quality of study designs. Then theses were searched in the PubMed database. Journals of published theses were classified according to category, scope and impact factors of the year 2014.   Results: 1508   theses   included   to   study.  Clinical studies   were   71,7%   of   the   theses,   while   25,6%   of   the   theses   were   non-clinical experimental and 2,7% of the theses were observational studies. Clinical studies were Level I in 8,6 % (n=93) and Level II in 5,8% theses (n=63). A total of 224 theses (14,9%)  were   published in  the   journals  that indexed   in   PubMed   database   from   1974   to   2012.   Fifty-two   (23,2%) were published in SCI; 136 theses (60,7%) were published in SCI-E journals and 36 theses(16%) were published in other Journals that indexed in PubMed.  Conclusion: The quantity and quality of published theses need to be improved and effective measures should be taken to promote quality of theses. Theses from universities and Training hospitals which did not allow open access to their theses, and incomplete records of the National Thesis Center database were major limitations of this study. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0326This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

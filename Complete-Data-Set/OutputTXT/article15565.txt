Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of the Regenerative Organic Rankine Cycle System on Decarbonization for a Bulk Carrier
Özet: Shipping has a very important share in world trade. However, it has an inevitable effect on global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, there is a great motivation for the reduction of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Waste heat recovery systems based on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology have a significant potential to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. In this study, the optimization of the regenerative ORC was carried out for a bulk carrier. Multi-objective optimization was performed using a Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm that is a powerful and novel algorithm. Thermo-economic evaluations were carried out by considering the design and off-design working conditions of the ship. In addition, the impact of the optimized ORC system on decarbonization was investigated. The results showed that the annual average Wnet was determined as 372.78 kW. The annual average fuel saving and the annual average CO2 reduction were calculated as 522.83 tfuel/year and 1628.09 tCO2/year, recpectively. The findings indicated that using the RORC system on ships is a promising solution for increasing emission restrictions and environmental concerns.

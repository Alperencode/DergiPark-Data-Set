For this purpose, the distribution of postgraduate theses on Turkish teacher candidates according to year, program type, university, subject, method and design characteristics was examined and thus their tendencies were revealed. This research was designed according to the qualitative research model. In the research, postgraduate theses on Turkish teacher candidates were scanned and the obtained documents were analyzed. As a result of the research, it has been determined that 84 postgraduate theses, 59 of which are postgraduate and 25 are doctoral dissertations, have been written from 2002 to 2022, related to Turkish teacher training and candidates before service. It has been observed that the most theses on the subject were completed in 2019, and these theses were mostly prepared in Gazi, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart and Atatürk Universities in Türkiye. In theses about Turkish teacher training and candidates, writing skills, professional competence, anxiety and attitudes, and self-efficacy perception were the most preferred subjects. In addition, quantitative research models are used more in theses on Turkish teacher training and candidates.

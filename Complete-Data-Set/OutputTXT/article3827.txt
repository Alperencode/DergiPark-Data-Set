Özet: Hüseyin Rahmi Gürpınar is an important writer who has made great contributions in various aspects of literature such as novels, drama, stories and translations. Hüseyin Rahmi is also known to write reviews. When we consider him as a critic, firstly his books called Cadı Çarpıyor which he wrote in response to Şahabettin Süleyman’s criticism within the frame of the novel Cadı, and Şakavet-i Edebiyye, which he wrote targeting Ali Naci, become prominent. Apart from these works, he also has literary articles that have remained in the reviews and show the quality of criticism. Hüseyin Rahmi, who started to appear in the publishing world with his articles since 1888, published reviews in many newspapers and magazines such as Tercüman-ı Hakikat, İkdam, Âti, Akşam, Yeni Kitap, Yedigün. Hüseyin Rahmi dealt with the literary issues of his period with these articles in periodicals. Therefore, keeping the pulse of the literary world of the period, he made comments in every field of literature from literary movements to literary genres within the framework of his own artistic understanding. However, no article has been written that can reveal Hüseyin Rahmi’s approach to literature within the framework of his criticisms in periodicals. In this study, by examining Rahmi’s criticisms his views on literature will be evaluated.

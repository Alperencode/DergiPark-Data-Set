Makale Başlığı: BIOSYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION AND DETERMINATION OF SUN PROTECTION FACTOR (SPF) OF IRON NANOPARTICLES WITH BEE BREAD
Özet: Bee bread is a food product obtained by fermenting bee pollen with honey and storing it in honeycomb cells. In this fermentation, phenolic compounds remain unaffected and unchanged. Bee bread contains approximately; there are 35% sugar, 24-35% carbohydrate, 20-22% protein, 3.5% lactic acid, 2.43% mineral, 1.6% lipid and 1.6% fat. Within the scope of the study, biocompatible iron nanoparticles were synthesized (BB@FeNPs) by utilizing the potential reducing powers of these components contained in bee bread. Characterization of obtained bee bread-based nanoparticles; were performed using spectroscopic techniques such as ultraviolet-visible light spectrophotometer, fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, and x-ray diffraction spectrometry. Scanning electron microscopy was used as a microscopic method in the characterization of nanoparticles. In addition, the sun protection factor (SPF) of the synthesized nanoparticles was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Although the studies in recent years tend to search for bioactive molecules of natural origin, no nanoparticle synthesis with bee bread has been encountered in the literature. This study is important as it is a first in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with bee bread.

Makale Başlığı: Cystatin C Levels, Status of Oxidant-Antioxidant and Inflammation in Hemodialysis Patients
Özet: Objective: Cystatin C is considered an important marker for the detection of renal dysfunction. It was aimed to determine cystatin C levels, status of oxidant-antioxidant and inflammation in hemodialysis (HD) patients.Methods: The study groups consisted of 20 HD patients and 20 healthy controls. Blood samples were obtained from the control group and from the HD group before hemodialysis. Serum cystatin C, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidative state (TOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) interleukin 18 (IL-18) levels were detected by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and some biochemical parameters were analyzed by autoanalyser.Results: Cystatin C, TOS, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18 and CRP levels of the HD group were significantly higher than the control group.Conclusion: As a result; oxidative stress and inflammation were increased in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. New strategies and new studies are needed to reduce the increase in oxidative stress and inflammation in HD patients.

Makale Başlığı: Factors Controlling Potential Toxic of Heavy Elements Speciation in Arid Soils
Özet: Three groups of some Egyptian surface soil samples (G1, GII, and GIII), located in; El-Gabal El-Asfar, Zenin, and El-Khanater were collected in this study, these groups of soils were classified under two orders i. e. Typic torrerts and Typic psamments according to the American taxonomy. The source of contamination in the first and second groups was created from applying sewage sludge and irrigation with wastewater for more than 50 years in the first group (G1), for about 10 years in the second group (GII). The third group of soils (GII), however, was affected by its location beside traffic road beside, its treatments with organic fertilization types. All groups of soils were investigated for distribution, chemical fractions of Pb, Ni, Cu and Zn and their mobility as affected by different soil properties of these groups. The obtained results indicated that neither the time of exposure to sewage sludge applied nor wastewater irrigation treatments influenced heavy metals concentration in different soil samples. In addition, the decreasing order of different heavy metals distribution generally was: Residual (Res) > Fe-Mn oxide > carbonate (carb) ~ organic (org.) > exchangeable (exch.) > water-soluble (WS). In some cases, however, the organically bound form of heavy metal was the predominant form, especially in GIII. Correlation analysis between soil properties and heavy metals distribution in different forms indicated that clay content, surface area and organic matter were the most soil properties contributing to the relative distribution of the studied pollutants in different fractions.

Makale Başlığı: North and West Black Sea Port Cities by the Eyes of Travelers and Geographers Between Xth and XVth Centuries
Özet: It is known that various records have been kept about the western and northern regions of the Black Sea since ancient times. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, there is an increase in the volume of information about the region in different works. Along with the travels and geographical studies, the information obtained about the region in question also laid the groundwork for the studies of later times.Between the X and XV centuries, travelers and geographers convey information about the western and northern regions of the Black Sea for ministerial and some commercial and political reasons. The data obtained show that some port cities developed in the north of the Black Sea, especially in the Crimean Peninsula and around the Azov Sea, with the effect of trade. Over time, the capacity of maritime transportation and logistics increased and commercial networks establishedwith other port cities in the Black Sea like Sudak, Kaffa (Feodosia), Solgat (Staryi Krym), Chufut Fortress (Kirkyer), Sarikirman (Chersonese-Sevastopol), Don. There are also cities such as Azov (Tanais), where the river joins the Azov Sea, Matrakha (Tmutorakan-Hermonassa) on the Taman Peninsula and Akkerman (Akçakirman), Costantia (Constanta-Armocastro) outside these regions.While some authors only mention the names of the cities and give information about their location or coordinates; some authors, who are mostly travelers and are in the cities, give various information about the events they have seen and heard and witnessed in their works. With this information, the physical features of the cities such as architecture, ports, markets, as well as their commercial structure, transportation opportunities, and some political events of the aforementioned periods are reflected.

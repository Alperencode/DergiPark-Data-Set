Makale Başlığı: Macromineral intake and effect on hospitalization of patients in the orthopedic and traumatology ward
Özet: This study was carried out with the aim of investigating the correlation between nutrition and macromineral intake levels with hospitalization duration and complications among patients with orthopedic diagnoses. The sample for the study comprised 85 patients admitted to Tekirdağ Namık Kemal University Health Practices and Research Hospital Orthopedic and Traumatology ward with diagnosis of orthopedic disorders. Among patients, 17.7% had femur fracture, 12.9% had tibia/fibula fracture, 12.9% had foot/ankle fracture, 14.1% had arm fractures, 23.5% had arthroscopic surgery, 10.6% had knee prosthesis and 8.3% had hip prosthesis. Among patients, 47.1% had complications observed after hospitalization, while the reduction in loss of appetite and diarrhea complications as potassium intake increased was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Of patients, 94.12% had NRS 2002 score below 3, while 5.88% had NRS 2002 score of 3 and above and were at risk. It was identified that patients at risk for nutritional status had statistically significantly longer hospitalization (p<0.05). Male patients had statistically significantly more Ca, P, K and Fe consumption compared to women (p<0.001). Based on the results, nutritional programs planned by dietitians will contribute to shortening hospitalization duration and preventing malnutrition.

Makale Başlığı: AN OVERVIEW OF THE EUROPEAN UNION REGULATIONS DURING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC AND AN EVALUATION OF THE EU DIGITAL COVID CERTIFICATE (VACCINE PASSPORT) APPLICATION
Özet: During the COVID-19 pandemic, which was announced in December 2019 and turned into a massive outbreak within a few months, the total number of cases in the world has reached 300 million and the number of casualties has reached approximately 5.5 million in a period of approximately 2 years since the emergence of the virus. Within the scope of combating the pandemic, vaccination practices were also implemented in early 2021. The European Union (EU) and its institutions have been extremely ineffective in the fight against the Covid 19 pandemic in the first phase. The EU, which has been transformed into a supranational structure with economic, political, cultural and legal integration goals, has almost failed in its fight against Covid-19, and this has been loudly expressed by EU institution officials. In addition, member states have acted in a manner completely contrary to the integration process, which is one of the important goals of the EU. In the process, it was also observed that the system established by the EU was problematic and inadequate, and that member states acted differently during the implementation of inspections and measures. The EU launched the Vaccine Passport scheme in July 2021. The implementation of the vaccine passport and the regulations for this implementation were evaluated differently both within the EU and in member states. The implementation of the vaccine passport-certificate, which aims to ensure a balance between the regulation prepared within the scope of combating the pandemic and the limitation of this right in terms of freedom of movement and public health, deserves to be examined as it contains problematic and unclear issues in terms of EU law.

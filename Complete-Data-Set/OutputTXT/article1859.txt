Makale Başlığı: Reactiveness of contemporary art audiences and an instance: Jens Haaning’s Take the Money and Run
Özet: Jens Haaning, after embracing a request from a museum to reproduce his old work, took the budget but he didn’t reproduce it, introduce this act as a contemporary artwork: Take the Money and Run. Haaning’s attitude was announced as a new sensation of contemporary art; severe reactions came from social media users; many thought that this act is not art. These kinds of actions which are based on the reactiveness of avantgarde art in the early twentieth century are approved as artwork for so long time. While people react to the actions that can be done easily in the ordinariness of life, the purpose of artists is precisely to attract the attention of people. In this article, based on Haaning’s work, the sensational attitude of contemporary art, the distance between art-criticism, and relationship between contemporary art audience are discussed, the reasons for the reactivity are determined and suggestions are made.

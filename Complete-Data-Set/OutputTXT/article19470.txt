Makale Başlığı: Human and Robot Employees in the Future of Businesses: An Evaluation in the Context of Society 5.0
Özet: Within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, robotic technologies have been used intensively in business life and it has become inevitable to examine the strange interaction between human employees and robots from the framework of management science. The sense of pressure and uneasiness created by the digital age in human employees has brought motivation and performance problems to business life. However, the working principles of human employees and robots need to be resolved with interdisciplinary approaches. In this research which was carried out in the context of Society 5.0, the administrative and behavioral problems that may arise from the interaction of human and robot employees in the future enterprises were evaluated on a theoretical basis. Theoretical and application-based solutions were developed for the management-based, competence-based, psychological, sociological, and economic-based problems of human employees. It is expected that the research can contribute to the emergence of management strategies that can be used in the solution of problems caused by human and robot interaction, which are predicted to be experienced intensively in the businesses of the future.

Makale Başlığı: Our surgical experience in gall bladder polyps
Özet: Our study includes the retrospective analysis of 35 patients who were operated with the diagnosis of gallbladder polyp, between May 2005 and June 2011 at Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, 3rd Department of General Surgery. In this period 59 patients were diagnosed by gallbladder polyps, but only 35 of them were operated. Twenty one of 35 patients who were operated in our clinic with the diagnosis of gallbladder polyps, were female (%60) and 14 were male (40%). The mean age was 47.1. In all cases, ultrasound is used as a radiological examination. According to the preoperative ultrasonography reports of the patients; in 14 (40%) cases there was a single polyp, in 7 (20%) cases there were multiple polyps, in 13 (37.2%) cases there were polyps and gallstones and in 1 (2.8%) case his findings were suspicious for malignancy. We performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy to 32 (91.5%) of 35 patients and 3 patients (8.5%) were performed open cholecystectomy. According to histopathological examination, cholesterol polyps in 19 patients, cholesterol polyps + cholelithiasis in 13 patients, adenomatous polyp in one patient, and adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder in one patient were found. During the pathological examination of a patient who was operated with the diagnosis of polyp; there was no polyp detected, and a gallstone adherent to the gallbladder wall was observed. As a result, even if there is no symptom, surgical treatment must be performed to the patients over 50 years of age, with a polyp size over 10 mm, and with cholelithiasis, because of the possibility of malignancy. The cases with polyp size under 10 mm must be followed up with a 6 months period by ultrasonographic examination. During this time; surgery must be considered if there is an increase in polyp size and number of polyps or symptoms were developed.

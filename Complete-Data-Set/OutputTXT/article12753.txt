Makale Başlığı: Multiple Myeloma Case with Pericardial Involvement
Özet: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an atypical plasma cell dyscrasia in the bone marrow (BM) which accounts for about 10% of all hematological malignancies. While extramedullary disease (EMD) is reported at a ratio of 6-20% in MM, cardiac and pericardial involvement is rare. In the event of cardiac or pericardiac involvement, on the other hand, progression into cardiac tamponade takes place in 60% of the patients. We will present a very rare case of recurrence with pericardial involvement after autologous stem cell transplantation

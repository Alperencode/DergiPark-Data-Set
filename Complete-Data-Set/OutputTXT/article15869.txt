Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Environmental Impact Assesment Processes for Hydropower Plants
Özet: Energy is considered to be a key player in the generation of wealth and also a significant component in economic development. This makes energy resources extremely significant in the world. Efforts to prevent negative impacts of hydroelectric power plants (HEPP) or to evaluate the measures to be taken to minimize these impacts are carried out within the scope of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). However, the existing EIA process in the environment has become inadequate to provide environmental standards. This has made it necessary to develop the cumulative (CEIA) and strategic (SEA) Environmental Assessments, which are the advanced stages of the traditional EIA. The CEIA is the assessment of the effects of an action along with other human activities in the past, present or future, leading to environmental impacts. The SEA, a tool for the implementation of sustainable development, is defined as the process of evaluation of possible negative effects of plans, programs and policies on the environment and the process of reducing these impacts. In this study, the problems and inadequacies encountered in the implementation of EIA in HEPP projects have been examined and the innovations brought by CEIA and SEA to environmental management and the necessity of these processes have been evaluated with case studies. At the end of the study, some suggestions have been made to better implement the CEIA and SEA processes.

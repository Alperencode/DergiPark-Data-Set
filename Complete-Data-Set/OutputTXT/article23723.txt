Makale Başlığı: The Use of Local Products in Molecular Gastronomy in Turkey
Özet: The emergence of “molecular gastronomy” extended the meaning of the “gastronomy”, which once meant being specific cuisine to a particular place (such as French or Indian cuisine) or a particular time period (such as Ottoman or Seljuk cuisine). In the molecular cuisine, where science, technology and art are used together, the presentation of new tastes and tastes beyond the usual ones has become possible. The production of modern products in molecular gastronomy takes place through the use of chemical additives, instrumental devices and techniques. Studies have been carried out to include products such as olive, olive oil, honey, and molasses, which are important national agricultural products of our country, and some local products into molecular gastronomy with techniques such as emulsification, encapsulation, sous-vide, foaming, taste-smell transfer, pollination, and liquid nitrogen. In this study, it is aimed to review the use of both local cuisines and products of national importance in molecular gastronomy in Turkey. National and international scientific literature is reviewed, and the data were obtained. The study has been created as a guide for those who are a party to bring local products to molecular gastronomy.

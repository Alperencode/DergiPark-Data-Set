Makale Başlığı: Nutritional Composition and Fatty Acids Content of Neogobius melanostomus caught in Central Black Sea
Özet: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gender and monthson nutrient components and fatty acids contents of Neogobius melanostomus known as round goby caught in the Middle Black Sea (Ordu). The average protein, lipit,moisture and ash values of these male species were 19.14-20.70%, 2.89-1.22%,77.81-79.13% and 1.19-1.36%, respectively, while female values were 18.54-20.47%,1.01-1.22% , 77.87-79.69% and 1.22-1.37%, respectively. The percentages of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fattyacids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the Neogobius melanostomus species were in the range of 27.18-31.14%,14.55-18.99% and 29.21-37.61% in male species whereas these values were25.86-28.94%, 15.71-19.73% and 28.52-33.92% in females species, respectively. The main fattyacids observed were palmitic acid (C16: 0), stearic acid (C18: 0), palmitoleicacid (C16: 1), oleic acid (C18: 1n9), vaccenic asit (C18: 1n7), erucic acid(C22:1n9), linoleic acid (C18: 2n6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20: 5n3) anddecosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6n3). High amounts ofOmega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA, were detected in both sexes. w6/w3ratios were determined at low rates in both sexes. It was determined that themonthly period and gender were effective on the nutrient components and fattyacid content of Neogobius melanostomusspecies.

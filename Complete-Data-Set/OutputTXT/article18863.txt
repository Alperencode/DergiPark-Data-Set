Makale Başlığı: Development of the Adaptation to Curriculum Change Scale
Özet: The purpose of the study is to develop a reliable and valid tool to measure level of teachers’ adaptation to curriculum change. A trial form with draft items were prepared based on previous research on educational (curriculum) change and written feedbacks obtained from teachers. The trial form was analyzed by experts regarding content and clarity. Explanatory factor analysis was conducted on the data collected from 253 teachers through the trial form to establish factor structure of scale. A 29-item scale with seven factors was obtained. The scale explained 68.68% of total variance and had dimensions of cooperation (1), change management (2), effect of change (3), concerns about change (4), information seeking (5), feedback (6) and change awareness (7). Confirmatory factor analysis on the data obtained from 303 teachers confirmed seven-factor structure of the scale (χ2/df = 2.11, SRMR = .06, RMSEA = .06, GFI = .85, AGFI = .82, NFI = .87, NNFI[TLI] = .91, CFI = .92). Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the scale administered to two different samples was found .84 and .86, respectively. The study concluded that Adaptation to Curriculum Change Scale for Teachers was a reliable and valid instrument to identify level of teachers’ adaptation to curriculum change.

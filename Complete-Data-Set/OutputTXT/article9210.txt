Makale Başlığı: Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Children's Arm Rehabilitation Measurement
Özet: Purpose: This was aimed at the Turkish validity and reliability of the Children's Arm Rehabilitation Measurement (ChARM) used in the evaluation of upper extremity rehabilitation measurements.Methods: The study included 69 (34 girls, 35 boys) children with cerebral palsy (CP) between 6-15 years of age. Children's upper limb functions was evaluated by ChARM and Manual Ability Measure (ABILHAND-Kids). The correlation between the ChARM and ABILHAND-Kids was examined to detect validity of the scale. The Cronbach’s Alpha value was calculated to detect internal consistency. To determine reliability, internal consistency and time invariance were examined. To determine time invariance, children with cerebral palsy were test-retest reliability evaluated 14 days after the first evaluation and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) value was calculated. Results: In the statistical analysis performed, it was determined that there is an excellent positive correlation between ChARM and ABILHAND-Kids. (r=0.917, p<0.001). Internal consistency of the ChARM was determined high (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.958) and test-retest reliability was very high (ICC=0.953).Conclusion: The results of the study revealed that ChARM is a valid and reliable scale that can be used in the evaluation of upper extremity activity limitation in children with cerebral palsy.

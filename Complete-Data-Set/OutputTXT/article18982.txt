Makale Başlığı: Introduction
Özet: In the age of Omicron, the vaccine apartheid and increased inequalities, we present the 16th issue of the Masculinities Journal. In the claustrophobic atmosphere of demands for equity and the refusal to share, lockdowns and global efforts for vaccination, we are now about to reach at the 9th year of the journal. The pandemic continues as universal access to the coronavirus vaccine is prevented by the wealthy countries, causing several others suffer very high death rates and the trauma of the pandemic. As we present our new issue, we would like to remind that a critical look at power monopolies and the violence caused by them today is more welcome than ever, and that men and masculinities require intensified critical analyses in that sense.

Makale Başlığı: On the Alternative Approach to Artifacts  in Environmental Education
Özet: This paper advocates developing an alternative strategy for encouraging environmentally responsible actions related to technical artifacts (useful, human-made objects). It argues that we should care for and respect them as unique individuals embedded in the network of functionality (positive intrinsic motivation) and not only because neglecting them may lead to an ecological catastrophe (negative intrinsic motivation) or because of external motivators, e.g. saving money (extrinsic motivation). Such a reinforcement of positive engagement with artifacts through environmental education may complement existing strategies aimed at transforming patterns of how humans deal with them. The paper concludes with suggestions for classroom activities targeted at undergraduate students for cultivating a revised understanding of everyday artifacts.

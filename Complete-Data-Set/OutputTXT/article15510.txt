Makale Başlığı: With Advantages and Disadvantages  The Role of Non-Saccharomyces Yeast In The Wine Industry
Özet: This article aims to describe non-Saccharomyces yeast and their effects on wine composition, fermentation, chemistry and organoleptic characters. The use of non-Saccharomyces yeast is on the rise in the wine industry despite the negative perception from previous research. It is known that higher levels of non-Saccharomyces yeast could cause implications during winemaking practices. On the contrary, non-Saccharomyces yeast provides complexity, richer aroma and flavour and decreases ethanol content. If the main goal is using indigenous yeast and having a starter culture, use of non-Saccharomyces yeast collected from winery environment could be an option, yet again a risky option. However, previous studies indicated the relation between acetic acid production and the use of non-Saccharomyces yeast. In brief, it is important to increase sanitation in the winery environment and personal awareness to maximize cleanliness and to reduce any unwanted yeast activity. More importantly, in the recent years, the use of non-Saccharomyces yeast is attracting winemakers to achieve unique wine styles, and it is an important topic that should be taken under consideration, particularly on a research basis, specifically for targeting consumer liking-perceptions of the wine. In addition to their positive effect on sensory characters on wines, non-Saccharomyces yeasts as bio-control agents (BCAs) is also charming researchers around the globe.

Makale Başlığı: Morphologic Evaluation of the Glenoid Cavity on Dry Scapula
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the notch and shape variations of the glenoid cavity (GC), to emphasize its clinical importance, and compare it with the previous studies.Material and Methods: This study was performed with 157 (78 right sides, 79 left sides) adult Anatolian dry scapulae. The GCs were typed as oval, pear, and inverted comma shaped and noted the number of GC notch.Results: The most common GC shape was found as the pear shaped with 63 (80.8%) at the right side, 49 (62%) at the left side, and 112 (71.4%) in total. The second most common GC shape was found as oval shaped with 13 (16.6%) at the right side, 28 (35.5%) at the left side, and 41 (26.1%) in total. The glenoid notch was found at the right side, left side, and totally; 28 (35.9%), 19 (24.1%), and 47 (29.9%), respectively. All of the inverted comma shaped GCs had distinct glenoid notch, while the oval shaped GCs not. The pear shaped GCs had indistinct glenoid notch or no glenoid notch. The glenoid notch was found at the right side, left side, and totally on the pear shaped GC; 26 (41.3%), 17 (34.7%), and 43 (38.4%), respectively.Conclusion: Pear shaped GC was found as the most (71.4%) common shape in this study. Forty-seven (29.9%) of the scapulae had a glenoid notch. The notch and shape variations of the GC are important and this study will contribute to anatomists, orthopedists, and radiologists from this perspective.

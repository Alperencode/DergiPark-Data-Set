Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL CREDITS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN TURKEY: A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Özet: Agriculture is an important sector supported by various reasons by the governments. Policies or supports should guide agricultural production since it depends on climatic conditions, seasonal production or supply-demand elasticities. Agricultural production is related to agricultural credits, which are one of the agricultural supports. Agricultural credits are one of the resources applied by the producers who cannot fulfil their production activities. In this study, the relationship between agricultural credits and agricultural production in the Turkish economy is examined with annual data for the period 1990-2020. The cointegration relationship between agricultural credits and agricultural production is tested with the Johansen cointegration test. Coefficient estimation is made with FMOLS, DOLS and CCR methods, which are long-term coefficient estimators. The findings reveal the existence of a cointegration relationship between agricultural credits and agricultural production. In addition, the increase in agricultural credits increases agricultural production in the relevant period in the Turkish economy. This result shows that agricultural credits support agricultural production.

Makale Başlığı: THE MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
Özet: The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is a case that has deeply affected the entire international public opinion, regardless of east and west. This event could not be clarified with all its legal, political and theological aspects, and it could not even be discussed in a transparent manner within the dialectic of international judgment. In a world order where international law, human security and human rights are the main targets, impunity for a brutal murder committed in the diplomatic mission building may lead to the root cause of this order before anything else. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a theocratic regime should not result in an impediment to the legitimate application of international law. The United Nations order and the international community are built on the foundation of human security. Even in the face of an event that people are accused of, their right to life, not to be tortured and to a fair trial are guaranteed. Effective efforts should be made by national and international authorities in the face of extrajudicial execution attacs carried out  by using diplomatic immunity armor without such an accusation. If political and diplomatic murders are left unpunished, legal security and the legitimacy of international law, which is the foundation of states, will suffer the most. No political benefit justifies an action that would undermine the rule of law. It is also an absolute requirement from the point of view of international law to clarify all aspects of the murder of Khashoggi and to satisfy a reasonable and legitimate request to punish all his perpetrators.

Makale Başlığı: ROBUST IMAGE WATERMARKING USING DISCRETE COSINE TRANSFORM  DC COMPONENTS AND MULTI-ADAPTIVE SCALING FACTORS
Özet: In recent years, processing and deployment of digital information has become common, due to the increase in both the number of users and connection speeds in internet use. Therefore, the need to protect digital pictures against the risk of copying has arisen. One of the recommended methods for copyright protection is the watermarking of digital images. In this study, it is aimed to perform a robust digital watermarking method by changing the coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain and to increase the performance of the existing methods. In the proposed method by using multiple adaptive scaling factors, all blocks of the input image are evaluated with the spatial frequency (SF) metric and each block is assigned by a scaling factor proportional to the amount of texture. Therefore, it is aimed that watermarked images exhibit maximum resistance against attacks with minimum deformation. In the experiments performed, it is seen that the proposed multiple adaptive scaling factors method is more efficient against the attacks at the same transparency level than the methods using fixed and dual-adaptive scaling factors

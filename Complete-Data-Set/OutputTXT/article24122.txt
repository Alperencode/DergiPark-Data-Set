Makale Başlığı: The effect of cefquinome on hematological and biochemical parameters following repeated subcutaneous administrations in sheep
Özet: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cefquinome on hematological and biochemical parameters following repeated subcutaneous administrations in sheep. The study was conducted with six clinically healthy Merino sheep with age and body weight of 1.5 ± 0.2 years and 39 ± 2.7 kg, respectively. Cefquinome was administered subcutaneously to the sheep once a day for five days at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture prior to drug administration (0 h) and at 48 h and 120 h following the first drug administration. Blood samples were analyzed to determine hematological and biochemical parameters. Hematological and biochemical parameters did not alter following repeated subcutaneous administration of cefquinome (P > 0.05). These results indicate that cefquinome could be safe and well-tolerated following repeated subcutaneous administrations of 2.5 mg/kg once daily for five consecutive days in sheep. However, there is a need for molecular and histopathological investigation of the safety of cefquinome after repeated administration in sheep at different doses and administration routes.

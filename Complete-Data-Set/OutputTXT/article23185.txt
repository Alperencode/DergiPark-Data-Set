Makale Başlığı: THOUGHTS ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE PRE-PAID HOUSING SALE CONTRACT MADE WITH THE LAW NUMBER 7392
Özet: The most basic need of people is shelter. To meet this need, they must have a residence. Due to the increase in housing prices and economic conditions, it is getting harder to acquire a house day by day. For this reason, it is almost impossible for low and middle-income people to own a house by paying the price in advance. In the pre-paid housing sales contracts known as model sales or sell-make in practice, the consumer, who buys the house, pays the sale price in cash or partially, and the delivery of the house is made after the payments are made in whole or in part. This situation requires special protection of consumers, and for this purpose, prepaid housing sales contracts are specially arranged in the Law on Consumer Protection. Some arrangements have been made in favor of consumers, such as the seller not claiming the invalidity of prepaid housing sales contracts made in ordinary writing, the seller's obligation to inform the consumer and the obligation to provide a guarantee. However, these regulations are not sufficient to protect consumers. With the Law No. 7392, some changes were made in the Law on the Protection of Consumers. One of them is the TKHK Art. 44 amendment regarding prepaid housing sales. In this study, the benefits and harms of the change for the consumer will be discussed and various solutions will be presented for the protection of consumers in terms of prepaid housing sales contracts.

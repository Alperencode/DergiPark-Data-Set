Makale Başlığı: Women,  Men,  and Thermal  Response: An  Entropic Account  of  Gender Differences in Breathing During Exercise
Özet: This study aimed to determine differences in the thermal response of the respiratory muscle between healthy men and women during exercise. We analyzed the lungs of eight men and eight women thermodynamically. Previous work of breathing data of 16 endurance-trained healthy  subjects  undergoing  a  progressive  cycle  exercise  test  to  exhaustion  was  used  for calculations. During exercise, glucose  absorbed from the  blood flow  was 2.12 mmol/L  for men and 4.1 mmol/L for women. Glucose consumed for respiration was found as 10.6 and 20.49  mmol/min  in  men  and  women,  respectively.  Exergy  destruction  in  the  respiratory muscles of men and women was 0.41 and 0.79 kJ/min, respectively. Entropy generation rates for  men  and  women  were  calculated  as  1.38x10-3and  2.66x10-3(kJ/K)/min,  respectively. Women  were  generated  entropy  remarkably  higher  than  men  and  consumed  more  glucose than  men  during  exercise  for  breathing  due  to  their  less  efficient  ventilatory  response  to exercise.  In  conclusion,  gender-based  alterations  in  lung  and airway  dimensions  result  in higher work of breathing and therefore glucose cost of respiration, higher exergy destroyed, and higher entropy generated in women during exercise for given exercise intensity.

Makale Başlığı: Geological and Building Stone Characteristics of Kocaeli Kandıra Stone
Özet: Natural building stones have been used asbuilding stones in buildings from the earliest ages of history to the presentday, as well as for decorative purposes. One of the most widely used naturalstones in the Marmara region is Kandıra Stone. This stone is located in theAkveren formation in the Kandıra region and has different lithologicaldefinitions. The availability of the Kandıra Stone as a building stone has beendemonstrated in terms of its physical and mechanical properties as well as itscompliance with standards. The physical properties of Kandıra Stone includingunit weight, water content, water absorption by weight, density and porosityand mechanical properties including uniaxial compressive strength, post-frost compressionstrength, frost loss value, impact strength, bending strength, average abrasionresistance and Los Angeles test results were evaluated. Within the scope ofthis study, physical property tests were performed on Kandıra Stone specimensin the laboratory and the unit volume weight was defined 2.35 g/cm3,water absorption was 3.6%, density was 2.54 g / cm3 and porosity was9.6%. As a result of the evaluations, Kandıra stone can be used for decorationand renovation works, landscape architecture, wall and ornamental coatingpurposes.

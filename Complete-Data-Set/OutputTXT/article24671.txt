Makale Başlığı: A Useful Way to Dispose of Phenolic-rich Agro-industrial Wastes: Mushroom Cultivation
Özet: The by-products resultingfrom the agricultural productions are arised in extrem quantities every year.Some agricultural by-pruducts such as olive press waste, green wallnut husks,tea wastes, coffee pulp etc. have been recognized as phenolic-rich wastes. Thehigh polyphenol content in these wastes could have negative impact on soil andflora, if they are not disposed properly. Moreover, some studies haveinvestigated the toxicity of phenolic compounds on aquatic organisms. Burningof these wastes may cause to increase amount of carbondioxide in atmosphere.Conversion of phenolic-rich wastes by different processes is therefore adesired aim. Mushroom has been used either as a therapeutic and protein-rich foodsfor many centuries. Mushrooom cultivation on agricultural wastes could be apromising method to reduce the the environmental pollution problems as well asproduction of tasty and healty foods. This paper reviews the potential uses ofphenolic-rich materials as substrate in cultivation of edible and medicalmushrooms.

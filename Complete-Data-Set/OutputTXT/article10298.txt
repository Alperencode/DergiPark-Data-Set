Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE INFLAMMATORY POTENTIAL OF DIET WITH EATING ATTITUDES AND APPETITE: A STUDY ON NUTRITION AND DIETETICS STUDENTS
Özet: Objective: The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is an index that examines the effects of dietary components on serum pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between dietary inflammatory potential, eating attitude and appetite of the students of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics.Method: Questions including sociodemographic characteristics and nutritional status, EAT-40 to evaluate eating attitudes, Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) for assessment of appetite, and a questionnaire containing 3-day dietary recall record were applied to calculate the dietary inflammatory indices of the participants.Results: The median age of the students was 22 years and 91.9% of them were female. The frequency of the normal weight group was 69.4% and 78.3% of the students skipped meals, the most frequently skipped meal was lunch with 40.5%. Most of the students (92.3) had a normal eating attitude with.  It was found that 95.1% of the students with normal eating attitudes were female, 49.3% were 4th-grade undergraduates and 70% were of normal weight. It was found that 91.1% of the students whose appetite status was not impaired were women and 48.9% were 4th-grade undergraduates. Most of the students with anti-inflammatory diet potential were female with 93% and, 45% were 4th-grade undergraduates while 70% of them were of normal weight. No statistically significant correlation was found between the students' EAT-40 scores and BMI, between EAT-40 and DII scores, and between BMI and DII scores (p>0.05). Conclusion: Dietary inflammatory potential has no relationship between eating attitude and appetite.

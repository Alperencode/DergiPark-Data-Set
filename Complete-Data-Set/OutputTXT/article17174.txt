Makale Başlığı: The Contribution of the Gendarmerie in Disaster Response: The Case of the Elazığ-Sivrice Earthquake
Özet: The effect of globalization in the world, the increase in the welfare level of citizens in nation states, the development of industry and infrastructure in countries, and the intensification of urbanization necessitate taking more effective measures against the risks that cause disasters. This is the main reason why states have adopted a holistic risk management approach to disasters in recent years. This work; aims to determine the contribution of the gendarmerie to the disaster management process on the basis of increasing Turkey's disaster risk management and inter-agency cooperation opportunities. Within the scope of this work; first of all, the definitions of disaster, disaster risk and management were reached and the current situation of Turkey for disasters was emphasized. Subsequently, the disaster management method carried out within the state organization in Turkey was explained and the role of the gendarmerie in this process was revealed. Finally, the contributions of the gendarmerie's activities to the disaster management process in the Elazig-Sivrice earthquake in 2020 was determined. The aim of the study is to increase the possible contributions and cooperation of the gendarmerie in similar disasters. The study was carried out on a theoretical basis by making a literature review. As a result of the study, it was determined that the gendarmerie supported many working groups within the framework of the “The Turkey National Disaster Response Plan” in the Elazig-Sivrice earthquake.

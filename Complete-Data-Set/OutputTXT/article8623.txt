Makale Başlığı: Identifying Strategic Elements for the Development of Green Hospitals: An Analysis of Energy Based Factors with the DEMATEL Method
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the strategic elements that are important for the development of green hospitals. In this context, firstly, a detailed literature review was carried out. Thanks to these investigations, four different energy-based factors were determined. These criteria are reducing carbon emissions, using clean energy, ensuring energy efficiency and choosing low energy consuming equipment. In order to determine the most important of these criteria, an analysis was carried out with the DEMATEL method. As a result, the most important criterion for the development of green hospitals is the use of clean energy. In addition, reducing carbon emissions is another important factor. As can be understood from these results, hospitals urgently need to switch to the use of clean energy. In this process, small-scale solar panels can be considered. Thanks to these panels, hospitals can both produce their own energy and the energy used can be environmentally friendly. In this context, it will be possible to reduce the costs of these types of energy, thanks to comprehensive research and development studies. In addition to this mentioned issue, it will be possible for small-scale solar panels to gain cost advantages thanks to government incentives such as tax reductions and low-interest loans.

Makale Başlığı: How Do the Crises of Falling Oil Prices and COVID-19 Affect Economic Sectors in the Rentier Economies? Evidence from the GCC Countries
Özet: This  study  analyses  the  impacts  of  unprecedented  falling  oil  prices  and  the  COVID-19  outbreak  in  early  2020  on  the  stock  markets  of  GCC  countries   –   countries   considered   as   natural   resources-based   rentier   economies.  To  this  end,  the  research  uses  daily  data  for  295  companies  under  the  categories  of  services,  industrial,  and  financial  sectors  in  GCC  countries  from  January  1,  2020,  to  February  23,  2021.  The  analysis  was  conducted  over  two  phases.  The  first  phase  extended  from  January  1,  2020, to July 30, 2020, while the second phase extended from August 01, 2020, to February 23, 2021. The research utilised 18 random effect models in each phase to capture the impact of the oil price crisis and COVID-19 outbreak  on  each  economic  sector  in  each  of  the  GCC  countries.  This  study’s  findings  reveal  that  the  decline  in  oil  prices  and  the  spread  of  the COVID-19 epidemic were strong in the first phase, while this impact diminished in most economic sectors in the Gulf countries in the second phase.  However,  the  GCC  countries  have  not  been  impacted  equally  by  the crisis of falling oil prices and the COVID-19 outbreak. The results show that the hardest-hit countries are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, respectively, while the least impacted countries are Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Furthermore, the sector-wise analysis results reveal that the industrial sector in Saudi Arabia is the sector most affected by the oil price crisis, and the financial sector in Saudi Arabia is the sector most impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak in the GCC countries.

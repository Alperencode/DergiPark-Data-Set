Makale Başlığı: AN ONLINE STUDIO EXPERIENCE IN LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE BASIC DESIGN EDUCATION
Özet: Landscape architecture is one of the academic disciplines that teach design courses and design theory. The basic design course in Landscape Architecture education helps students learn the language of form through line, develop their design skills, and contribute to their abstract thinking skills in the creation of landscape design projects.. In the global Covid-19 pandemic process which caused curfews, the replacement of formal education by distance education has eliminated studio environments where design lessons are taught. For this reason, educators had to reconsider their curriculum and reconstruct it for distance education. The material of the present study, which aims to evaluate the results of design education in the distance education process, are the online studio studies of the Basic Design course taught in the 1st year of the Department of Landscape Architecture at the Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design of Bartın University in the 2020-2021 Fall Semester. In the study, online studio studies and assignments were examined, suitable studies were selected, the advantages and disadvantages of the distance education process were revealed by determining the extent to which the selected studies met the learning outcomes of the course.Basic Design, Design Education, Distance Education, Landscape Architecture.

Makale Başlığı: PERCEPTIONS OF COVID 19 AND ONGOING PANDEMICS BY CHILDREN IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENTS
Özet: The present study is aimed to define how the COVID-19 pandemic was perceived amongst the primary school children by the pictures they did. The study group, in which the qualitative research method was used, included 241 first grade students in a primary school in the Antalya Kepez region, which was selected by the convenient sampling method. While collecting data in the research, students were asked "what do you understand when the COVID-19 is mentioned?" and to draw a picture of their feelings. The data were evaluated as a percentage (%) and frequency with the SPSS program. In the conclusion of the study, it was observed that most of the students in the study group perceived the COVID-19 as "an insect", and less of the students perceived it as "a disease". COVID-19 pandemic is drawn by the children generally as a free time activity at home.

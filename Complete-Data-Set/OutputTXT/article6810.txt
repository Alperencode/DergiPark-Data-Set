Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Relationship Between Social Anxiety and Aggression in Adults with Hearing Loss
Özet: Objective: Our research aims to investigate the relationships between social anxiety and aggression of adults with hearing loss and, to examine social anxiety and aggression in terms of many variables.Materials and Methods: 118 volunteers with hearing loss between the ages of 18-60, who were reached through various institutions or the internet, were included in the study. The study data were collected using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Demographic Information Form. In the statistical analysis, appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests were used according to the distribution of the data.Results: In the results of our study, weak positive correlations were found between the BPAQ and LSAS scores of adults with hearing loss (p<0.01). In addition, it was observed that gender had an effect on aggression, it did not affect social anxiety, and males had more verbal and physical aggression (p<0.05). Individuals using hearing aids or cochlear implants were found to have higher levels of hostility than those who did not use them (p=0.051). While the increase in education level from secondary school decreases the level of verbal aggression; the aggression level of those whose income level is below the minimum wage was found to be the highest (p<0.05).Conclusion: Hearing loss affects the level of social anxiety and aggression in terms of many variables. It may be beneficial to provide psychological support for people with hearing loss who show a high level of aggression and social anxiety.

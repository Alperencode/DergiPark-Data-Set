Makale Başlığı: Heavy hemolysis after organophosphate poisoning by chlorpyrifos ethyl
Özet: Organophosphates (OPs) inactivate the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, thus increasing the cholinergic effect. In a clinical setting, patients with OP poisoning may experience nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, or in severe cases respiratory failure, seizures, and death. Rarely, acute hemolysis has also been observed. The existing literature contains few descriptions of several delayed diseases associated with OP poisoning. This article presents the case of a patient who experienced severe hemolysis approximately one week after OP exposure. Only a small number of similar cases have been previously examined.

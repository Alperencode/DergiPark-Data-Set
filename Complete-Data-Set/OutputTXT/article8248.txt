Makale Başlığı: THE ART OF PERFORMANCE AND THE LIMITS OF THE BODY
Özet: The consequences of wars and revolutions, of great social events, have often resulted in major changes in government, economy, social-cultural and art. The First World War, by taking the whole world under its devastating effect, inflicted wounds on humanity that are difficult to heal. This destructive effect also showed itself in the works of artists and led to the emergence of different artistic understandings. Dada, conceptual art, happening, land art and arte povera are some of the art movements that emerged after the war. It is seen that this understanding, which is often the artist's rebellion, is also an opposition, a desire to keep art and art objects separate from everything, a desire to destroy stereotyped values and resistance. Now art could appear anywhere and in anything. Art, which has undergone changes in this direction, eventually came to the use of the human body as an art material and got rid of the concern of permanence and got free and original by getting rid of traditional expression, shaping and even a certain place. The purpose of this research is to examine the emergence and basic principles of the art in question through performance artists such as Yoko Ono, Cris Burden, Josep Beuys and Maria Abramovic. The literature review method was used to obtain the data in the study. In this context, based on the interviews made with the mentioned artists in previous years, findings regarding their understanding of art were obtained and evaluations were made in line with these data.

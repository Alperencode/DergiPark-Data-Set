Makale Başlığı: THE INVISIBLE SIDE OF THE SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT PARADIGM: A CRITICAL READING ON WOMEN THEORISTS AND THEIR SOCIAL & INTELLECTUAL NETWORKS
Özet: The aim of this study is to reveal the “invisible face” of the scientific management paradigm, the contributions of women theorists in management and their social/intellectual relations. With a literature review about women theorists (Lillian Gilbreth, Mary Van Kleeck, Katherine H.M. Blackford, Mary Barnett Gilson), who play a role in the scientific management paradigm, their attitudes towards the relevant paradigm have been presented, and their common connections have been tried to be analyzed. Based on the main purpose of the research, the invisible face of the scientific management paradigm, the defining qualities of women theorists, the relationship between social network analysis and social assets and these relationship models were created. The connections of theorists with Taylorism, Social Darwinism, Social Progressionism and Feminism were revealed with the NodeXL Graph Application, with social networks and matrices. It seems that the female theorists are related to each other and Taylor. Three theorists (Lillian Gilbreth, Mary V. Kleeck, Katherine H. M. Blackford) who were directly interested in Social Darwinism were identified. As a result of the research, it has been determined that the scientific management paradigm or the social, economic and political conditions of the current age are under the influence of Social Progressism and Social Darwinism.

The implementation process of the research lasted for 12 weeks and a total of 18 children's picture books were used within the scope of interactive reading studies. According to the results obtained in line with the analysis of the data, there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms such as the number of words, word diversity and sentence meaning unit in the pre-test narrations structured by the students with the storytelling method, while there was a significant difference in the post-test storytelling scores in favour of the students within the experimental group.

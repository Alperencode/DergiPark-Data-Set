Makale Başlığı: Some results on pseudosymmetric normal paracontact metric manifolds
Özet: In this article, the M-projective and Weyl curvature tensors on a normal paracontact metric manifold are discussed. For normal paracontact metric manifolds, pseudosymmetric cases are investigated and some interesting results are obtained. We show that a semisymmetric normal paracontact manifold is of constant sectional curvature. We also obtain that a pseudosymmetric normal paracontact metric manifold is an ηη-Einstein manifold. Finally, we support our topic with an example.

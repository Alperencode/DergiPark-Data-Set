Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Courtyard in Terms of Spatial Characteristics in a Public Spatial Configuration: Example of Diyarbakir Yenisehir Municipality Service Building
Özet: Courtyards in built environments, which have been built in geographies where the hot climate is dominant since ancient times, are meaningful cavities that provide natural ventilation and lighting for the indoor living spaces around them, landscapes in which nature is carried indoors, and special spaces that increase climatic comfort. The historical living areas in southeast Turkey, which has a particularly hot and arid climate, are full of spatial configurations in which the courtyard is at the center. However, the number of public buildings incorporating these spatial configurations is quite limited today. For this purpose, Yenişehir Municipality Service Building in Diyarbakır, which is a public building with an award-winning architectural project and a space configuration with a courtyard, was found worthy to be examined specifically for its courtyard. As a main purpose, this study focuses on today's users on the spatial configurations with courtyard and especially on determining their perceptions of the courtyard. The data were obtained through the questionnaire application applied to 57 users and semi-structured interviews. In this research, it has been determined that the courtyard, which has public features, creates a positive impression on its users in terms of its use. It is revealed by user reviews that the courtyard has a strong potential to act as a catalyst in future building designs, especially in hot climates.

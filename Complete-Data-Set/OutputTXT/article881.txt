Makale Başlığı: What is the Most Important Percentage of Pressure in Inspiratory Muscle Warm-Up Exercises for Children?
Özet: It has been observed that device inspiratory muscle warm-up exercises (IMW-D), which has started to take place in general warm-up in recent years, contribute to performance in a positive fashion. In the literature, IMW-Ds are usually performed with 40% of maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). There is not a single study explaining or determining the best percentage of MIP in both acute and chronic studies on IMW-Ds in the literature. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to determine the most important pressure percentage to improve respiratory parameters in IMW-Ds. A total of 40 athletes with licenses in a federation between the ages of 12-14 participated in the study. Participants underwent IMW-D with a powerbreathe plus respiratory exercise device at 15%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 60% of the MIP on different days, and immediately following these exercises were performed with a spirometer, respiratory parameters were measured as (FVC, FEV1, PEF). Kruskal Wallis H test was used in order to determine the difference between measurements. As a result of statistical analysis, it was found that while there was significant difference in PEF values between 15% and 40%, 45% of MIP; and the highest improvement was 45%, 50% and 60% of MIP in FVC, FEV1 and PEF values. It can be suggested that sedentary people and athletes who want to improve their respiratory parameters can also train with 45%, 50% and 60% of MIP without depending on 40% of the MIP applied only as given in the literature for a higher improvement in their IMW-D.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Rectal Ozone Use on Bacterial Translocation and Oxidative Stress in Experimental Colitis Model
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rectal ozone on the histopathological healing of the colonic mucosa, tissue oxidative stress, and bacterial translocation in the experimental colitis model. Materials  and  Methods:  Three  groups  of  rats  were  randomly  formed  [Group  1:  Sham  group,  group  2:  Control  group,  group  3:  Ozone  treatment  group].  Microscopic  and  macroscopic  scoring  were  done  histopathologically  in  all  groups.  Glutathione-s-transferase  (GST),  superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in the colon and liver tissue. Blood cultures were taken for the detection of bacterial translocation. Results:  Microscopic  damage  scores  were  found  as  0.0  (0.0-2.0)  in  the  sham  group,  3.0  (3.0-3.0)  in  the  control  group,  2.0  (0.0-2.0)  in  the  ozone  treatment  group  (p=0.001).  Macroscopic  damage  scores  were  found  as  0.0  (0.0-1.0)  in  the  sham  group,  3.0  (0.0-4.0)  in  the  control group, 0.0 (0.0-1.0) in the ozone treatment group; the scores of ozone treatment and sham groups were found to be statistically different (p=0.004). Compared to the control group, the bacterial translocation in the liver, mesenteric lymph node, portal vein, spleen, and systemic blood was fewer in the ozone treatment group. Statistically significant differences were also observed between the groups’ SOD and GST levels in colon tissue and MDA, SOD, and GST levels in liver tissue. Regarding MDA values in the liver tissue of the groups, it was 1.95±0.43 in Group I, 3.63±0.81 in Group II, and 1.19±0.72 U/mg in Group III (p=0.017). When the liver tissue SOD levels of the groups were examined, it was 8.21±0.76 U/mg in Group I, 4.57±0.58 U/mg in Group II, and 8.62±1.13 U/mg in Group III (p=0.029). When GST values in liver tissue belonging to the groups were examined, 0.35±0.16 in Group 1, 0.23±0.03 in Group II, 0.49±0.13 U/mg in Group III (p=0.036). Conclusion: Rectal ozone application plays a role in increasing the organism’s antioxidant activity and has an effective role in increasing the  enzyme  activities  of  antioxidant  defenses.  In  addition,  rectal  ozone  application  has  a  positive  effect  on  wound  healing  at  a  histopathological level and reduces bacterial translocation in various tissues.

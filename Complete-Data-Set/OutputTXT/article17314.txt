Makale Başlığı: A Consideration on Self-Regulating Learning Skills and Models in Higher Education
Özet: One of the fields in which by far the most impact of Covid 19 Pandemic that came in sight in Wuhan Region of China for the first time and took hold of the whole world in a short span of time has been admittedly higher education. Higher education institutions’ transition to distance education soon after the beginning of pandemic in Turkey has brought along the questions about the quality of learning process. Students’ attending classes online and their limited interaction with the instructor required skills to shine out more for students such as controlling and managing their learning process. In order for students to become more effective learners and to manage their learning process, self-regulated learning skills suggest a theoretical perspective that can offer essential contribution. During distant and online learning processes, self-regulation skills can play a strategic role for getting great advantage of learning and teaching processes. In this regard, the aim of the existing research is to examine the four theoretical models brought forward in the field of self-regulated learning and to offer some suggestions for higher education students and academicians that they can use in the learning process. As a result of this study on models, it has been determined that the model put forward by Zimmerman can be used practically in the higher education process. It is thought that the establishment of academic units that will support the learning process of students in higher education institutions will contribute to the improvement of quality in higher education.

Makale Başlığı: XVIII. Century Poet Nevres-ı Kâdim and His Persian Tahmîs to Saadi Shirazi
Özet: Nevres-i Kâdim who lived in the mid-18th Century is one of the distinguished figures in classical Turkish literature in the fields of both Poetry and Prose. Although the information about Nevres, who was originally from Kirkuk, is very limited, his scholarship on poetry and prose works are of particular importance in that they contain some information about his life. In these works, he was able to reflect on his life abroad in exile. In respect of resolving his poetry style, among his works, Nevres' Persian Diwan is as valuable as his Turkish Diwan showing his proficiency in the Persian language and literature. With his Persian Diwan Nevres manifested his success in writing Persian poetry, as in Turkish poems. In this Diwan which consists mostly of gazel poetries, other poetry styles like qasida, time-writing, tahmîs, sâkînâme, muamma, lugaz, rubaie, kıt’a and mufred are also visible. In particular, two tahmîs parts that consist of 97 paragraphs in the divan are written to qasidas of the great poets of Iranian literature, Saadi Shirazi and Urfi Shirazi. These two parts present the strong influence of these two poets on Nevres’poetry.This study is about the life, the works, and the literary personality of Nevres-i Kadîm. It also focuses on the Nevres' Tahmîs that he wrote to Saadi Shirazi’s qasida. This work is also important in terms of his personal life in that it led Nevres to be appointed as a Mudarris (the old status which is equivalent to modern professor). This study aimed to evaluate the poetry aspect of Nevres-i Kadîm based on the above-mentioned tahmîs in the context of Saadi’s effect on classical Turkish poetry

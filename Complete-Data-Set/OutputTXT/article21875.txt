Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Socio-Economic and Cultural Problems of Highly Educated Syrians in terms of Social Acceptance and Adaptation: The Case of Kayseri
Özet: The aim of this study is to understand the meaning of temporary protection for highly educated Syrians, how they experience the migration process and the problems they face in this process. Syrians who had to immigrate to Turkey due to the war have different language, religion, ethnic identity, belief and culture, as well as different education levels, professional equipment and skills. In this context, it can be stated that Syrians with a high level of education are a group with different needs and expectations and experience the migration process differently. In the migration process, the transfer of educational status and various professional skills to the country of origin is related to the political relations between the source country and the destination country, and the policies of the emigrated country. Many immigrants generally have to work in labor-intensive and low-paid jobs, unlike the education and professional qualifications they receive. In this sense, it is thought that understanding the problems experienced by the highly educated Syrians who had to migrate to Turkey is important both in terms of the practice of living together with different cultures and in terms of contributing to the literature for the studies that can be done in the field of migration regarding the Syrians with high education levels in the future.

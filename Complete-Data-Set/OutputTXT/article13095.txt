Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Fiber Type and Ratio on the Physical and Mechanical Properties of Marble Powder Added Fiber Concrete
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to determine the effect of steel and macro synthetic fibers used in different ratios and types on the physical and mechanical properties of concrete. For this purpose; Macro synthetic fiber was used at 0.25%, 0.30% and 0.35% by volum4, steel fiber at 0.50%, 0.75% and 1.00% by volume. Chemical additives and marble powder were used in fixed proportions. In the study, the water / cement ratio was taken as 0.54 constant according to the fiber concrete TS 802 mixture. In this research, beams of 10 × 10 × 40 cm and 15 cm cube samples were produced for fresh and hardened concrete properties. The effect of fiber type and ratio was investigated by performing physical and mechanical tests on the produced samples. As a result of the study, as the fiber ratio of fiber mixes in fresh concrete increased, workability and unit volume weights decreased. As a result, as the fiber ratio in fresh concrete increases, the fiber ratio has negatively affected the workability and the unit volume weights decreased.  In hardened concrete; In hardened concrete; As the fiber ratio increased, the initial crack stress and bending stress increased. The highest mechanical and physical properties were given by 1.00% steel fiber and 0.35% macro synthetic fiber concretes.

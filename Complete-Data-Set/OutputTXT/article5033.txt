Makale Başlığı: Factors predicting biochemical recurrence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: single-center experience
Özet: Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate factors predicting the development of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in our clinical experience with patients over a long follow-up.Material and Methods: The data of 758 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) were retrospectively reviewed. In the postoperative period, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value is measured as 0.2 ng/mL and above, regarded as biochemical recurrence (BCR). The non-BCR group was regarded as Group 1, and the BCR group as Group 2.Results: The mean age was similar between the two groups. The PSA values ​​were significantly higher in the group that developed BCR (p<0.001). The biopsy Gleason score (GS), risk classification, and specimen GS were significantly higher in this group (p=0.02, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). The BCR group also had statistically significantly higher positive surgical margin (PSM), extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymph node invasion rates. According to the multivariate analyses, PSA, risk classification, specimen GS, PSM, SVI, and T stage were significant parameters in the prediction of BCR.Conclusion: The parameters ​​that predict the development were determined as the PSA value, risk classification, specimen GS, PSM, SVI, and T stage. The widespread adoption of commonly accepted methods will help achieve better patient management and optimize patient expectations.

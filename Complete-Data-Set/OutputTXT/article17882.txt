Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Sowing Rates on Plant Growth and Density of Linseed (Linum Usitatissimum L.) Cultivars
Özet: This study was conducted to determine the effects of some linseed varieties (Karakız, Beyazgelin and Sarıgelin) and sowing rates (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 piece/m²) on plant growth under the ecological conditions of Kırşehir in 2021. The experiment was conducted in a randomized split-block design with three replicates. In the research, the number of emergence, flowering and maturity period (days), the technical stem length (cm), the number of lateral branches and number of plants (pieces/m2) were analysed.According to the results obtained from the experiment, the effect of cultivars and sowing norm on the number of emergence, flowering and maturation days were found to be significant, while the earliest development was observed in Sarıgelin variety, while an increase in earliness was detected as sowing norm increased. Karakız variety gave the best results in terms of technical stem length (26.57 cm). The number of lateral branches significantly different according to both the variety and the sowing norm, and a decrease in the number of lateral branches were determined with the increase in sowing norm. It is determined that Karakız variety was higher number of plants in unit area and the number of plants were increased with increase in sowing norm.

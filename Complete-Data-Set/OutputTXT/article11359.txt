Makale Başlığı: Racism in Theory and Practice
Özet: The work titled "Racism in Theory and Practice", written by Hür Sinan Özbek, tried to explain racism with specific theories, thinkers and examples, starting from Ancient Greek and Egyptian Civilizations.  In the study, she touched on racism-economy, racism-sexism, racism-nationalism, racism-xenophobia relations, the new concept of racism and whether there is racism in Turkey.  The relationship of racism and sexism with the capitalist economic system is discussed. When the author touches on the issue of antisemitism, he claims that it arose for economic reasons after the Republic, and that economic reasons were an important factor in the formation of racism against Kurds and Syrians.    In addition to addressing racism in the historical process, Uzbek has also addressed current theories and approaches such as new racism.

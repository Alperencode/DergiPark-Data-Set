Data were analysed with IBM SPSS V23Results: The total number of applications made to our outpatient clinics was 91.580, and the number of single patients who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and had no additional chronic disease was 8.421. It was determined that 50.8% of the hypertension patients were male, 4.1% were diagnosed with anxiety and 2.7% were diagnosed with depression. It was also found that 2.4% of the patients had both anxiety and depression, 1.7% had only anxiety and 0.3% had only depression. A statistically significant difference was found between the distribution of anxiety and depression coexistence groups in hypertensionpatients according to gender (p<0.001).Conclusion: Chronic diseases can cause anxiety and depression, while anxiety and depression can also cause some chronic diseases. Due to the association of anxiety and depression, which we frequently see in the etiology of essential hypertension, treatment will be more effective and faster by continuation of the treatment of both diseases together in cases of comorbidity

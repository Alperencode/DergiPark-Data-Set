Makale Başlığı: Discussions on the Relationship of Sunnah with Revelation in the First Three Centuries
Özet: Discussions about the evidentiary value of sunnah, which started about a century and a half ago, arestill underway today. While some say that sunnah is not a source in religion, others continue to argue persuasively that sunnah is a religious source. Those who accept sunnah as a source in religion try to justify the fact that sunnah is proof by saying that sunnah is a revelation. Others claim that the revelation is peculiar to the Quran only. It is seen that these discussions, which also have an ideological dimension, will continue for a long time and similar views will often be brought to the agenda. In fact, it is noteworthythat the current debates were experienced in the same way in the past, especially in the first centuries after Hijra.  For this reason, in this paper, it is aimed to draw a panorama of the debates on the source of sunnah by emphasizing the views on the relationship of sunnah with revelation in the first three centuries AH.

Özet: Classical Arabic poetry, which constitutes an important aspect of Islamic Civilization, has a critical function in understanding Islamic texts, especially the Qur'an and hadith. In this context, the poetry of Jahiliyyah, which is the source of the Qur'an's style and its expressive power (expression/utterance), is important in terms of having the mentioned function. The work, which was introduced, fills a significant gap in the field by referring to the indicated function of the poem of Jahiliyyah in a theoretical and practical sense. The work analyzes selected eulogies from the poems of important poets of the Jahiliyyah period in a deep way, taking into account the morphological and syntactic functions of the language. The work, which refers to the elements that should be considered in the analysis of poetry through the texts, draws attention with its didactic and dialectical style, on which the taste for language is based.

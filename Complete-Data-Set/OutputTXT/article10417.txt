Makale Başlığı: A Research On The Perception of Crime In Political City Spaces: The Case Of Gazi District
Özet: In this study, the relationship between the crime phenomenon in urban political spaces and the historical development processes of urbanization in urban political spaces has been examined. The perceptions of people who spend their daily lives in political urban spaces, about the concepts of crime and delinquency, have been tried to be revealed in a historical perspective. Within the scope of the study, in-depth interviews were conducted with some people in critical positions, including the residents of Gazi District, who are known for their political identity, public employees working in the neighborhood, and local journalists. The participants were asked to evaluate the transformation of Gazi District's urban appearance, sociological structure, political structure, and relationship with crime in the process they experienced, and it was questioned how the unique urbanization adventure of Gazi District affected crime. As a result of the interviews, it was observed that as the political character of the places become crystallized, the state authority and in particular the effectiveness of the police weakens. This structure, which emerged as a result of the socio-political dynamics of the neighborhood, makes urban political spaces attractive for social groups that are in a relationship of insecurity with the state. Over time, urban political spaces, which attract criminal groups as well as political and cultural groups seeking to distance themselves from state authority, contribute directly or indirectly to the formation and maintenance of particular criminal identities.On the other hand, the participants in the neighborhood see political identity as a factor that prevents crime and attribute the increasing criminality in the neighborhood to the conscious passive attitude of the state. According to the residents of the neighborhood, the police's dealing with political groups rather than criminal groups in the neighborhood is an attitude aimed at weakening political identity and leads to an increase in ordinary crimes.

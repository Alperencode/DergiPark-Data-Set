Makale Başlığı: A New Actor in Tigris River Water Management and Potential for Political Crisis
Özet: Climate Change has become a global phenomenon affecting water resources around the world. Global water scarcity has become apparent due to dramatic changes in precipitation levels in many countries in arid and semi-arid regions. Finally, issues of water resource management in international politics have been discussed in the context of potential major political crises and the Tigris River is one of these sources. The water management of the Tigris River and the sharing of the resource have been discussed within the framework of the relations between Iraq and Turkey until recently. However, this issue gained a new dimension after the invasion of Iraq by the United States (US) and Coalition Forces in 2003. Iraq turned into a federal state after 2003 and a new regional government called the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government (IKRG) was established in northern Iraq. The study claims that the hydropolitical relations on the Tigris River reached a more chaotic dimension after this stage. In the study, the chaotic and potential crisis dimension of the subject is discussed. Iraqi water resources, constitutional authorities on the management of water resources, the approaches and discourses of the parties are examined in the study. In the study, it was concluded that the parties followed unilateral policies on the issue and as the water problem increased, the issue would turn into a bigger political crisis between the parties.

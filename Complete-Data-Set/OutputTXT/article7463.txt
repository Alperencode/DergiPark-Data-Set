Makale Başlığı: DISTANCE EDUCATION IN RUSSIA: A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
Özet: Distance education has long been an integral component of the education system of the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union. A great many students and teachers in the country have been benefiting from the merits of distance education. The statistics announced by the state officials indicate strong evidence for the presence of mainstream remote learning. However, there is little information with regard to distance education of the country in the western literature. This necessitates an overview of the system and the history of the integration. This article, thus, sheds light on the general information regarding the history and demography of the general and higher education system across the country. It further takes a slight detour to the history of distance education and contemporary practices.

Makale Başlığı: The Divan of Andalusian Poet Ibn al-Haddad: İntroduction and Analysis
Özet: The Muslim Arabs, who had conquered the whole of North Africa in the first century of the Hijra, were not content with Africa, but moved to the Iberian Peninsula from there, and brought Islam to all of today's Spanish lands. Within the eight-century-old Andalusian civilization, Muslims were successful in the field of literature, as in many other fields, and produced great poets. Ibn al-Haddad (d. 480/1087), one of the most important names, is a remarkable poet in many aspects such as giving importance to the use of literary arts, expressing his love for a Christian nun with his odes, and continuing the method of Eastern Arab poets despite being Andalusian. In this study, the poet's divan was examined in terms of rhetoric and content. In the article, rather, the aspects that make it stand out were highlighted and its remarkable aspects were examined. How a Muslim poet, who fell in love with a Christian nun but could not find the opportunity to marry her, expressed his love was especially examined. It has been emphasized how far from monopoly it is when using the rhetoric. Examples of how much aesthetic concerns are taken into account in the art of tehallus while passing from progeny to eulogy are discussed further.

Makale Başlığı: Examining Textbook Images on Values Education: Social Studies Lesson 5th Grade Example
Özet: It has long been shown in the textbook as an important part of the school system. Textbooks, which have an important place in the follow-up of the teaching process between the student and the teacher, have difficulties in keeping up with the rapidly developing technology. The studies carried out to make the textbooks more interesting lead to criticisms such as "the books were emptied". However, with the renewed curriculum, the social studies course has undertaken an important task in terms of gaining skills and values. Various visuals, news texts and reading texts have started to be included in the textbooks for the values aimed to be gained. In this research, a study was conducted to determine whether the 5th grade social studies textbook visuals contain the values determined in the curriculum and a frequency table was prepared. The visuals were evaluated by 23 students and 15 teachers, and their quality, necessity, relationship with the subject, positive or negative messages were examined. In the second part of the study, the same students and teachers were asked to interpret whether the determined visuals gave a message about gaining the values determined in the curriculum. In line with the findings obtained, inferences were made about the importance of textbook visuals in value education and suggestions were made.

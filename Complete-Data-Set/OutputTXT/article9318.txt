Makale Başlığı: The findings about relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and first-trimester aneuploidy results
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between thyroid autoantibody and first-trimester aneuploidy results. Thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) is the most common autoimmune disorder. Patients with TAI are usually euthyroid. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) in patients with or without thyroid dysfunction is associated with infertility, recurrent embryo implantation failure, and early pregnancy loss. The impact of TPO-Ab on first-trimester aneuploidy test results needs to be studied.Material and Method: This retrospective case-control study was conducted between December 2019 and May 2022. Patients with thyroid autoantibody positivity (n=112) were included in the study as the case group. The control group was selected from age and body mass index (BMI)-matched patients (n=130). Nuchal translucency (NT), crown rump length (CRL), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)) values were compared between the two groups.Results: This study included two hundred forty two age-matched (29.86±4.51) and BMI-matched (23.96±2.34) women. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of free thyroxine (FT4), PAPP-A and free β-hCG (p>0.05). NT as a marker for major chromosomal defects and CRL were comparable in case and control groups (p>0.05).Conclusion: There is no statistically significant relationship between thyroid autoimmune diseases and the first-trimester aneuploidy results.

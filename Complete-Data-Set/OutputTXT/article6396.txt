Makale Başlığı: Accelerated microbiological shelf life tests of cake cream produced with whey
Özet: Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of whey (PAS), which is the waste material of dairy factories, on some food pathogens and accelerated shelf life in cake cream.Materials and methods: Three different creams were made by adding 10 and 25% whey, based on the formula of pastry cream produced industrially (control sample). The presence of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, yeast-mold, Enterobacteriaceae, total mesophilic aerobic bacteria, total coliform, Bacillus cereus was investigated on days 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and 16 days of the storage of the experimental samples.The samples were stored at -18, +4 and +26oC. In preliminary experiments, it was observed that yeast and molds were the group of microorganisms that caused the most deterioration in cream cakes. For this reason, samples were stored at +15°C and +30°C in addition to -18°C, +4°C and +26oC, based on yeast and mold counts in accelerated shelf life tests.Results and conclusion: As a result of the study, it was determined that the increase in the amount of microbial load of whey added creams was less than the control cream sample.

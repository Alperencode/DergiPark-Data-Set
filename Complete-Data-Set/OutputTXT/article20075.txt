Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Analysis of 6 Tonal Dictation Books Published Between Years 2015-2020 in Turkey
Özet: ‘Knowing music’ means being able to read, sing and write musical notation. As someone specialize, it can be possible to decipher and dictate the notes. Dictation can be defined as the transfer of the melody heard on a paper using musical notation which is an important component of the ear training lectures and music education. It is an expected result that not only music writing but also musical hearing will improve through practi-cing dictation. It has been observed that dictation books have increased in number in recent years in Turkey. Although they serve the same purpose, the diversity of these books in terms of methods that are used attracts attention. However; no study was found in which the dictation books published in Turkey were examined and the methods they used were compared. In the study named ‘A Comparative Analysis of 6 Tonal Dictation Books Published Between Years 2015-2020 in Turkey’, 6 monophonic tonal dictation books published between years 2015-2020 in Turkey were examined comparatively. When comparing; along with the bibliography of the book, information is given about the author's duty at the time the book was published, the length of the dictations, the order in which the tones progress, how the dictations are being ordered and, if any, the instruction about the way they are to be played. Methodological differences between the books and suggestions for future tonal dictation books are presented.

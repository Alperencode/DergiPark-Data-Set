Makale Başlığı: Using The Analytic Hierarchy Process For Store Manager Selection: A Real Case Study
Özet: In today's competitive work environment, it is important for managers to have personnel who can move the company forward and adapt to changes as quickly as possible. Selecting the most suitable personnel has a great influence on the development of the company as well as on the motivation of the personnel. For this reason, the frequently encountered problem of personnel evaluation is a significant one. In this problem, the performance of the personnel is compared and evaluated considering the criteria set. Therefore, the personnel evaluation problem is a multi-criteria, decisionmaking problem. In this study, the personnel performance evaluation problem within Lanse Company was solved using the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP), a multi-criteria decision-making method. The criteria that are effective in personnel selection were determined through a literature review and interviews with the owner of the company and the Human Resources Team (HRT). Considering these criteria, a hierarchical model was constructed, and pairwise comparisons were made to obtain judgments. As a result of the pairwise comparisons, the most suitable person for the position of store manager was identified among the six employees working at Lanse. The results were presented to the decision maker in the form of a report. The validity and applicability of the findings were confirmed by the decision maker.

Makale Başlığı: ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR IN A CULTURAL CONTEXT: A CONCEPTUAL EXAMINATION ON ATTITUDES, VALUES AND GROUP DYNAMICS
Özet: The concept of culture is generally expressed as a phenomenon that people living in a particular society experience collectively. Lifestyles, value judgments and behaviors in the social structure form the basis of cultural values. These cultural values of societies shape many elements in the social structure they are in. One of these elements is the organizations that form the basis of business life. When considered within the social structure, the concepts of culture and organization are concepts that interact. In this context, organizational structures that survive in a society are primarily shaped by the cultural values of that society. Culture firstly creates the human and then the organizational climate in which the human is living. The culture-organization interaction gains importance at this stage, as the working person, who emerges with the influence of the cultural environment, makes his impact in social life felt through organizations to a great extent. As a matter of fact, this interaction also provides the cultural value-based formation of the field of organizational behavior. The importance of the study is based on this interaction point. In this context, the study is considered important in terms of giving place to different organizational behavior dynamics revealed by different cultural environments. The main purpose of the study is to draw attention to which specific organizational behaviors these dynamics point to when considered in terms of cultural values specific to societies.

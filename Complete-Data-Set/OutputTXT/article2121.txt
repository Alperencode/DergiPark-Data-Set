Makale Başlığı: The dimensional impact of the tangibles (financial aspect) on the customer’s satisfaction in the Islamic and traditional banks  in yemen
Özet: Measuring the dimensions quality of banking services is considered an important issue in this time as it has become recognized that the quality of services is an urgent matter from an economic point of view. This role is not limited to providing outstanding service only. Rather, the study seeks to compare the actual performance of the service provided with its expected performance in commercial and Islamic banks in Yemen.The importance of measuring one of the quality dimensions of banking services is extremely important, especially in light of the current circumstances in Yemen. Therefore, statistical analysis would be used to analyze the questionnaire that would be distributed to both Islamic and conventional banks and their customers. This would be followed by an evaluation of the opinions of both customers and employees in the banks. As such, the SERVQUAL (short for service quality) model was used to measure the difference between the customers' expectations of the service with the service actually provided to them. This measurement scale also depends on a set of dimensions or criteria that are presented to the customer to evaluate the service through : the tangibles (including materials, facilities, and equipment, staff etc.), which in turn reflects the level of service provided by the Yemeni banks from the point of view of their customers.From this perspective, this study was designed with the aim of improving and developing the tangible dimensions in Islamic and conventional bank in Yemen

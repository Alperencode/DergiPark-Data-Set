Makale Başlığı: Religious and Mystical Concepts in the Words of Elazığ-Harput Folk Songs
Özet: In folk songs performed in Elazığ-Harput music, which has a special position in Turkish music with traces of Turkish folk music and Turkish classical music, many poems from mani, koşma, gazel, kaside etc. which are verse forms of Turkish literature are used as lyrics. Musical works (ağır havalar) whose lyrics are composed of divân poems constitute the "art music" dimension of Elazığ-Harput music, and musical works (uzun ve oynak havalar) whose lyrics are composed of folk poems constitute the "folk music" dimension of this music. Although the concepts of non-religious constitute the majority in these lyrics used, Allah (CC), Mevla (CC), kurban (victim), bayram (feast), gül (rose), bülbül (nightingale) etc. there are also many religious-mystical concepts such as. However, we would like to point out that this situation stems from the daily spoken language rather than religiosity, and that everyone who is religious or non-religious has to use these concepts, since they take place in daily speech. In this study, religious and mystical concepts in Harput folk songs have been determined and information about these concepts has been given.

Makale Başlığı: Reading John McGrath’s The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil as petropolitical drama: Ecological exploitation and petromodernity
Özet: Petrodrama is an emerging category of contemporary theatre that addresses the challenges of petromodernity and its impacts on human and nonhuman worlds with a main focus on ecological problems. Focusing on the tribulations and vicissitudes of the Anthropocene, the age of the human, petrodrama is mainly preoccupied with the interweaving of performance and politics, one that raises questions about the way political discourses and systems perpetuate ongoing exploitations of humans and natural resources, particularly oil. To this end, this article rereads John McGrath’s play The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil (1973) as petropolitical theatre concerned with ecological exploitations of Scottish Highland and oil culture. After providing an overview of John McGrath and his political views on theatre, the study examines the successive stages of social and ecological dispossession in the Scottish history and McGrath’s deployment of petromodernity that configures every structure and relationships in society. In this sense, The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil highlights the imbrication of ecological disenchantment and politics, demonstrating how people are deemed as secondary compared to natural resources. As a politically engaged theatre, the play thus articulates an anti-capitalist critique of (petro)modernity and allows the possibility of action against greedy neocolonialism and neoliberalism by means of epic performances.

Makale Başlığı: Bending the Structure: Jacques Lacan Along the Axis of Structuralism and Poststructuralism
Özet: Lacan wrote and generated ideas at the intersection of structuralism andpoststructuralism, and the question of where he stands in this intersection is crucial tounderstand his conception of the subject. This essay takes the multiplicity of views onLacan as a structuralist and a poststructuralist as its starting point and aims to weighthese labels against the background of his specific theories and views. We suggestthat in his early phase when he was categorised as a structuralist, he had the seedsof his later poststructuralist phase, and when he was generating his poststructuralistideas, he was building them on his structuralist legacy. This evolution is similar to thatof Roland Barthes in that he establishes an ongoing dialog between structuralismand poststructuralism: he is both a threshold figure suggesting an amalgam ofthese movements, but he is also a dividing figure as his evolution points at theunbridgeable rupture between structuralism and poststructuralism.

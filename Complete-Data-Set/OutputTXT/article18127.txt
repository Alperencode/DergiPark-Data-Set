Makale Başlığı: Mehmet Nuri Pasha and Yıldız Court Defense
Özet: Whether Sultan Abdulaziz committed suicide or was the victim of a murder is still one of the controversial issues. The reign of Murat V, who took the throne after Sultan Abdulaziz, was also short-lived due to his mental problems. Abdülhamit was enthroned with the promise that he would declare constitutionalism. Abdülhamit II wanted to eliminate the people who were expected to create danger for him in the political arena, not only because his brother Murat V had recovered day by day but also because he wanted to avoid the fate of the previous sultans. For this purpose, he had a court prepared in tents in the garden of Yıldız Palace with the indictment which he had prepared by claiming the death of Sultan Abdulaziz. This court had included the delegation and the people who were on duty at the time of Sultan Abdülaziz. One of the most important people among these was Mithat Pasha, who prepared the first constitution of the Ottoman Empire. Nuri Pasha, who was Fatma Sultan's husband and was the chief viceroy at the time of the incident was also judged in that court. The purpose of the article is to reveal Nuri Pasha's role in history within the framework of the trial and the statement of Nuri Pasha in Yıldız Court.

Makale Başlığı: Sium sisarum L. var. lancifolium (M. Bieb.) Thell -a traditional spice from eastern Anatolia: chemical composition and biological activities
Özet: Traditionally consumed food and spices are significant sources in the daily life diet and constitute a large portion of the cuisine in Eastern Anatolia in Turkey. However, limited data available necessitate further analysis of their chemical composition and health attributing properties. This study aims to present phytochemical composition and biological activities of Sium sisarum var. lancifolium, a commonly consumed spice and food species in the region. Analytical studies to date have revealed the presence of high levels of phenolics (chlorogenic acid and isoquercetin) and volatiles (α-terpinene, camphene, cyclohexene, carene and p-cymene), which exhibits significant potential of digestive enzyme suppressive and antioxidant abilities. Data collected in this study suggest the use of Sium sisarum plant to obtain nutraceuticals and/or biotherapeutic agents that are able to regulate oxidative stress and enzyme activities.

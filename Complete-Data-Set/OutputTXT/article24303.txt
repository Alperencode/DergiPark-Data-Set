Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Gated Communities in Antalya in the Context of Universal  Design Principles
Özet: The environment and structures that are lived in include individuals with different abilities and qualifications. Every human being has been born with different personalities and abilities, has undergone different trainings and wants to meet different needs and seeks different ease of use. The fact that people have a wide variety of physical, mental and skills diversity requires that the spaces also address this diversity. To date, the standard design concept created by taking reference to “average human” cannot meet the needs of individuals in the diversity of individuals. Therefore, designs and arrangements made according to a person considered as the standard in design need to be designed using universal design principles with an inclusive nature of individuals with slightly different needs. By guiding the process of universal design, environment, structure and product designing, it is possible to create designs more conscious and to create sustainable environments, while rejecting unnecessary and specialized discriminatory solutions, adapting to the needs of all users, is beneficial.

In this study, the appropriateness of the closed residential settlements in Antalya Konyaaltı Location according to universal design principles was evaluated

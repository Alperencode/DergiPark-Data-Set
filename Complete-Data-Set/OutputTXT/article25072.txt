Özet: Empirically, this article deals with support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Germany and Turkey. By making a focus on the wind and solar energy resources, it analyses the evolution of renewable energy policies in Germany as a European member state and Turkey as a candidate country to understand increasing cross-national policy similarities in Europe. By identifying the incentive mechanisms behind international policy convergence, it is expected to shed a new light on renewable policy coordination options in the European Union.

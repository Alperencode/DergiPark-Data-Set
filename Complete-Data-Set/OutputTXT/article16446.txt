Makale Başlığı: A Semiotic Analysis of Georges Perec’s Novel “Things”
Özet: Georges Perec, who attracted attention with his experimental literary style among the writers of the 20th century French Literature, pushes the boundaries of the traditional novel by focusing on the three basic elements of the fictional narrative (person, space, and time) and aims to find new structures. The concepts of person, duration, and space, which are defined as “narrative coordinates” by Tahsin Yücel, are not independent of each other in the narrative and are considered to be indicators that create meaning in narrative analysis. In our study, we aimed to examine the characters, space, time, plot, description, and narration techniques in the novel ‘Things’ with this approach. Using the methods of semiotics, utterances, and narratology, we analyzed this work, which includes inquiries on the concepts of having and being, based on the semiotics of action and the semiotics of being that were developed respectively in the 1960s and 1980s.

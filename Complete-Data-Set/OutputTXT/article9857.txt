Makale Başlığı: An Adaptation Model for Historical Dishes: Ottoman Case Study
Özet: The aim of this study is to develop an adaptation model for historical dishes, based on examples from both the classical (1501-1844) and late (1844-1923) Ottoman periods. The study includes an anecdotal case study model and kitchen practices. In the selection and evaluation process, 1,156 kinds of food and beverages were listed for the classical period and 883 kinds for the late period. These foods and beverages were grouped and evaluated, revealing similarities and differences between the two periods. A total of 63 recipes were standardized, the nutritional values for one serving analyzed, and the rates of daily nutritional requirements evaluated. By this process “a model for adapting historical dishes to the present” was created that could be used in future studies.

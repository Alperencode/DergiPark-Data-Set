Makale Başlığı: On the variational curves due to the ED-frame field in Euclidean 4-space
Özet: In this study, we define a variational field for constructing a family of Frenet curvesof the length l lying on a connected oriented hypersurface and calculate the length of the variational curves due to the ED-frame field in Euclidean 4-space. And then, we derive the intrinsic equations for the variational curves and also obtain boundary conditions for this type of curves due to the ED-frame field in Euclidean 4-space.

Makale Başlığı: The Image of the Rose in the Writings of Jorge Luis Borges and Sezai Karakoç
Özet: Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges is a writer who, in addition to his short stories and poems, creates works that transgress the border between essay and fiction. The rose image used by Borges in his poems, whose ideas we trace in a wide range from literature to philosophy, history to mythology, can be described as a product of both his worldview and literary perspective.Like Borges, Sezai Karakoç is a prominent Turkish poet who frequently includes in his poems the rose image and when evaluated in the context of his writings, it also reveals his perspective on art and the world. He shapes both his perspective on art and his worldview within the framework of the idea of “revival” and writes poems around this ideal, as well as articles that convey his knowledge and ideas on the basis of civilization and culture. Therefore, there is an interaction between his articles and his poems, and it is important to follow the important concepts arising from this interaction, especially in terms of evaluating the rose image reflected in his poems. Although Karakoç and Borges are poets belonging to two different literatures, they reveal their perspectives on art and the world with the rose image that they frequently include in their poems and prose. The aim of this study is to evaluate the perspectives and worldviews of two poets on art in the context of the rose image based on the prose of both poets and to compare this image they use in their poems.

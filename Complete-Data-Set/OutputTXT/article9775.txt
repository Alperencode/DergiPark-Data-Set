Makale Başlığı: Prioritizing the Service Quality Dimensions of Logistics Service Providers Using SERVQUAL-Based Best–Worst Method
Özet: The level of service quality for airline transportation, where demand is increasing daily, is vital and must be determined. For companies to compete in the market and increase their service quality, they must know their customers well, analyze their expectations correctly, and make improvements. In this context, the SERVQUAL model is one of the most preferred and effective tools for measuring service quality. However, customers’ expectations cannot be included in the process using the traditional SERVQUAL model, especially with the effects of radical changes, such as the pandemic, and the development and transformation of emerging technology trends. Therefore, this study extends the traditional SERVQUAL model with four novel dimensions considering the expectations for logistics service providers, thereby providing a more comprehensive framework. Subsequently, the importance level of each dimension is determined and modeled through a multicriteria decision-making problem. Furthermore, the importance levels of the dimensions are determined using the best–worst method. A comparative analysis is conducted to examine the consistency of the proposed method. The results reveal that the most important service quality dimension is “responsiveness.” In addition, the “competence” and “reliability” dimensions should be considered to increase service quality.

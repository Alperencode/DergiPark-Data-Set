Makale Başlığı: Forecasting of illegal consumption in electrical power systems
Özet: Correctly using electrical energy, which is costly to produce, is essential. Estimating illegal electricity, which is one of the critical problems in our country, usage is a problem that needs to be solved in the energy market. Loss and illegal use, considered together, are different terms and should be evaluated separately. Evaluating each term separately will ensure that the measures to be taken or the investments to be made on any network will be healthier and positively change the perspective on electricity. In this way, it will provide information on whether the investments to be made in the regions should be made to fight against illegality or reduce losses. Estimating illegal uses will pave the way for significant developments in socio-economic terms and the fight against illicit uses.The estimation of the amount of illegal usage was carried out with artificial neural networks. Reducing the cities' networks to be estimated to a single transformer zone ensures that the amount of illegal use in artificial neural networks is estimated.Although there are not many studies evaluating illegal uses separately from natural losses, this study has made it possible to predict illegal uses with the proposed algorithms. With the help of the proposed algorithms, natural losses and illegal uses are estimated separately. The results are also supported with the help of artificial neural networks trained with different training functions. Both the amount of illicit use in the cities were estimated, and the performances of the education functions were compared.

Makale Başlığı: AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF TEST SPEED ON THE TENSILE PROPERTIES OF THE PETG PRODUCED BY ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
Özet: Additive manufacturing (AM) is a highly popular, versatile, and practical production technique due to its great ability of very fast prototyping. Compared to other traditional ways, the number of studies on AM techniques has increased in a noteworthy manner day by day on account of their promising potential for future works. In this paper, fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology was used to fabricate polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) specimens and to analyze the effect of the test speed on their tensile properties. As for the printing parameters, solely layer thickness values (0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.4 mm) were altered while the other factors were kept constant. In order to ascertain the production effectiveness, hardness and surface roughness measurements were carried out. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed at three different test speeds: 5 mm/min, 25 mm/min, and 50 mm/min. Furthermore, after deformation inspections were conducted both in macro and micro scales to evaluate the failure better. From the damage analyses, it was seen that ductile dominant mixed type failure is valid for lower test speeds even though brittle dominant mixed type failure is detected for 50 mm/min test speed.

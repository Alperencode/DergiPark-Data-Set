Makale Başlığı: BELIEVER PERSONALITY IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF VERIFICATION AND IMITATION
Özet: The concept of faith is a word that comes from the root e-m-n, meaning to believe, to trust, to be attached, to obey, to obey and to follow. It is a concept that is used with different conjunctions/letters in Arabic language grammar and semantics and gains different meanings according to the conjunction/letter used together, also differs and diversifies depending on the starting points and approaches, and has special field uses as well as meaning contractions and expansions. Investigative faith includes a meaning that provides the heart with a boost in regard to all the orders/reverses conveyed by the Messenger of Allah, inspires confidence, gives certainty, makes it safe enough to bring peace and tranquility, and ensures that it is accepted on the axis of reason and transmission. . On the other hand, imitation faith means acting on the suggestion and word of another, believing and trusting, trusting and following without feeling the need to search for evidence, question and research.These two concepts also reveal the type, degree and severity of commitment to what is believed, depending on the inner world of people. In this context, imitative faith, which expresses people's shallow ties and superficial faith, has less effect on influencing people and adding meaning to life, whereas, on the other hand, intangible faith, which is questioned, wondered and researched, established and internalized in the context of evidence and knowledge, affects the states and actions of people. It gives direction, becomes more effective, meets the search for meaning in life, and raises the person to the level of a more confident, happy and peaceful individual.

Makale Başlığı: Watching the Dream of Western Civilization in the Pygmalion of the East:  A Comparative Approach to The Novels Named Felâtun Bey with  Râkım Efendi and Naomi
Özet: The process called enlightenment, which started with the Renaissance, reform and geographical discoveries in the West, and then started a great change in the political and social field with the French Revolution and the industrial revolution, enables the influence of Western civilization to spread all over the world. The changes that non-Western societies made by the state, thinking that they were late and catching up with this process, leave themselves to the coexistence of the traditional and modernity, bringing imitation or conflict. It is seen that the novel also plays a role among literary genres in order to reveal and overcome the injury of consciousness created by duality. In the novels, the reflection of a new civilization circle on family and women is tried to be given with the female image that the male character dreams about. The fact that the man reveals the image of the woman he desires in his dreams, builds a work and falls in love with his work, corresponds to Pygmalion in Greek mythology. In the Pygmalion myth, while the male artist takes an active role in “creating a woman”, the woman is in a passive position as her body and mind are tried to be shaped by someone else. In this context, Ahmet Mithat Efendi from the Tanzimat literature, who observed the reflection of the new morality and lifestyle of the Western civilization on the society, reveals how the new female image should be based on the male character in his novel Felatun Bey and Râkım Efendi (1875) and in his novel Naomi (1924) from the modern Japanese literature. In this study, the similarities and differences between the male characters in the mentioned novels and the female figures representing their “works” will be examined.

Makale Başlığı: Educational behavior of the students in the design studios during the pandemic time
Özet: The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the process of adapting architecture students to the pandemic condition in the design studios due to wearing face masks and social distance measures. An architectural design studio is different from a normal classroom due to the open space for open discussion and dialogue and group work. The methodology of the research was designed based on the quantitative method with the application of the Likert scale questionnaire and analyzing the data in SPSS. The findings of the research identified that three factors are important for the students in the activities in the design studios including desk-crits (critique), social interaction, and the physical environment of the design studios. The Chi-square analysis illustrated that the students preferred to use the individual desk-crits over group desk-crits during the pandemic time due to wearing face masks and social distance. Apparently, public activities such as presentations, communication, and discussion were replaced with the individual desk-crits as a more adapted form to wearing face masks and social distance for the students in terms of personalization of the learning process in design studios during the pandemic time.

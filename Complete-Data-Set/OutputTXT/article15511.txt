Makale Başlığı: The effects of cinnamic acid and IBA treatments on the rooting  of  wood cuttings of black mulberry (Morus nigra L.)
Özet: In this study, the effects of IBA and cinnamic acid applications on rooting of black mulberry cuttings taken from black mulberry trees grown in Tokat were treated. 6000 ppm Indole Butyric Acid (IBA), 6000 ppm IBA+100 ppm cinnamic acid (CA), 100 ppm cinnamic acid with control which no application was applied on the cuttings taken in July, September, November and January periods. The cuttings were kept during 60 days in rooting beds containing perlite and heated from the bottom. The highest rooting ratio (48.3%) and the highest average root number (3.1) were obtained from the cuttings taken November and January periods with 6000 ppm IBA + 100 ppm CA application. Among the applications and the periods, cuttings were taken, 6000 ppm IBA + 100 ppm CA application and July and January periods were superior to others.

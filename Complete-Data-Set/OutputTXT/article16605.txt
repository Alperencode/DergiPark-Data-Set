Özet: In parallel with the rapid population growth in the world and the development of industry, water use is increasing day by day. It is very important to create alternative water resources in addition to the efficient use of existing water resources, in today's world, where access to clean water resources is difficult. The reuse of treated wastewater, one of these alternative sources, in different areas will contribute significantly to the sustainable use of water resources. Being one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul is one of the cities that receive the most immigration with its being a trade center, the size of its economy, its location, historical and touristic values. With a population of 16 million and an annual population growth rate of 24.2, large amounts of wastewater will inevitably occur in Istanbul. In this study, the amount of water savings that can be achieved if treated wastewater from Paşaköy Advanced Biological Wastewater Treatment Plant is used for irrigation of green areas and agricultural lands in Ömerli Basin without being discharged to Riva Stream has been calculated.

Makale Başlığı: Making Sense of Experienced Teachers’ Interactive Decisions: Implications for Expertise in Teaching
Özet: Teachers’ decision making has always been an area of curiosity in many studies  related to teachers and teaching. One approach to understanding teachers’  decisions is through the analysis of their reflection-in-action behaviours. This study,  based on the premise that one can gain understanding from examining experienced  teachers’ classroom performances, focuses on the interactive decisions made by ten  experienced language teachers. The study presents the findings of an analysis of  similarities in the motivations behind teachers’ interactive decisions, as  demonstrated in their verbal reports following the video recorded lesson  observations. These findings show that there are both shared pedagogical and  affective attributes among participant teachers. These results, and the insight they  give into experienced teachers’ decision making are potentially beneficial for all  pre-service and practising teachers

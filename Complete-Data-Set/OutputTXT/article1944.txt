Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE LOGISTICS SECTORS OF E7 COUNTRIES BASED ON LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE INDEX
Özet: The aim of the study is to analyze the logistics performance index values of E7 countries (China, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, Russian Federation). According to both the overall scores of the logistics performance index and the scores of the 6 sub-items of the index, the countries with the highest logistics performance are China and Turkey, and the country with the lowest is Russia. Although India has made significant leaps in some periods, it can be said that the logistics performance of the country is unstable. Improvements in logistics performance will positively affect global competitiveness by enabling countries to do their foreign trade more easily and effectively. For this reason, countries need to invest more in the logistics sector and increase their sectoral efficiency in order to increase their global competitiveness.

Makale Başlığı: Measuring The Performance of Logistics Firms with an Integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Making Model
Özet: Businesses can check whether they reach their goals by constantly analyzing their performance. MCDM methods are one of the methods used in performance analysis. Two types of MCDM methods are generally used to define criteria weights. These are subjective and objective weighting methods. SWARA (subjective) and Entropy (objective) methods were utilized to find criteria weights in this study. The CODAS method has been proposed to sort the companies. In this article, eight logistics companies on the Fortune 500 Turkey website were evaluated with an MCDM model consisting of SWARA, Entropy, and CODAS methods. According to the outcomes of the SWARA method, the VÖK/NS criterion was found to be the most significant criterion, while the FVÖKD criterion was found to be the most significant criterion according to the outcomes of the Entropy method. According to the outcomes of the CODAS method, the logistics company with the code A7 was defined as the company with the best performance. In addition, the results of the ROV, OCRA and COPRAS methods were benchmarked with the outcomes of the CODAS method and it was proved that the CODAS method reached correct results. This study contributes to the literature as the number of studies combining subjective and objective weighting methods is few in the Turkish literature.

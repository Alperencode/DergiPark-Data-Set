Makale Başlığı: Investigation On Weed Control with Using Cover Crops in Kiwifruit Orchards in Ordu
Özet: In this research, the effectiveness of cover crop applications in the control of weedswhich are unwanted plants in kiwi orchards, were investigated. In the study carried out in two different kiwi orchards (Young– 6 years old garden and old-13 years old garden) Vicia sativa L. (Common vetch), V. sativa L. (Common vetch) + Hordeum vulgare L. (Barley), V. villosa Roth. (Hairy vetch), V. villosa L. (Hairy vetch) + H. vulgare L. (Barley) four different cover crop applications were performed. Untreated weedy plots were used for control. In the experiment, according to the results of the three counts, effects of the applications on coverage (%), density (plant/m2), wet and dry weights (g/m2) and shading ratio (%) of cover crops and coverage (%), density (plant/m2), wet and dry weights (g/m2) of weeds were determined. During the trial, a total of 14 weed species were identified, 13 of which were both in the young garden and old garden. The most important weed species were Bromus tectorum L., Geranium dissectum L., Lamium purpureum L. and Lolium perenne L., Rumex crispus L. in young garden. The most important weed species were L. purpureum L. , L. perenne L. , R. crispus L., Fragaria vesca L. and Veronica hederifolia L. in the old garden. In the young garden, the values of cover crop coverage were V. sativa L. 62.91% , V. sativa L. + H. vulgare L. 66.41% , V. villosa Roth. 66.41% , V. villosa Roth. + H. vulgare L. 66.41%  and the weed coverage values were 15.91%, in V. sativa L. 23.79% in V. sativa L. + H. vulgare L., 12.04% in V. villosa Roth., 22.08%  in V. villosa Roth. + H. vulgare L. and 47.33% in control In the old garden, the values of the cover plant coverage were V. sativa L. 52.83% , V. sativa L. + H. vulgare L. 67.33% , V. villosa Roth. 54.00%, V. villosa Roth. + H. vulgare L. 58.66%  and the values of weed coverage area were 29.08% in V. sativa L., 20.79% in V. sativa L. + H. vulgare L., 32.41% in V. villosa Roth. 23.76% in V. villosa Roth. + H. vulgare L.  and 62.93% in control. As a result, cover crop applications have been effective on weed control compared with the control in kiwi orchards.

Makale Başlığı: Implementation of the laboratory and quality management in a Turkish medical biochemistry laboratory
Özet: Objective: This study aims to show how a biochemistry laboratory in Turkey is managed by national regulations and practices, and thus give the laboratory directors a wider perspective on laboratory and quality management. Materials and Methods: The pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical processes of our laboratory were evaluated according to the national regulations in Turkey by using the data of the patients who applied to our hospital, and the internal and external quality control results of the tests in 2020. Nucleus software was used as the laboratory and hospital information system (LIS/HIS) for data collection, and the Microsoft Excel program was used to analyze the data. Results: In our biochemistry laboratory, the physical conditions and safety of the laboratory, the recording and storage of electronic data and, the execution of the total testing process (TTP) are by the Medical Laboratories Regulation (Date: 09.10.2013 Number: 28790) and the other national regulations. The evaluation results for 2020 were as follows: Pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical error rates were <1%. Total allowable errors (TEa) of 15 biochemical tests were under Turkey TEa limits. Critical values notification rates were >50% and quality indicator rates were <5% for every three months. Our average turnaround times of test groups were within our determined target times.Conclusion: Our biochemistry laboratory successfully carried out the TTP in 2020. To give the most accurate and cost-effective test results to the patients timely, a lab director should manage the laboratory according to national and/or international regulations using medical and mathematical skills.

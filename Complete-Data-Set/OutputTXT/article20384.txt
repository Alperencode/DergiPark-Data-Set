Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Analysis of Cone Beam Computed Tomography Referrals in a Paediatric and Adolescent Patient Subgroup
Özet: Aim: This study was aimed to evaluate the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) indications in paediatric and adolescent patients and to investigate their compliance with the guidelines set by the DIMITRA (dentomaxillofacial paediatric imaging: an investigation toward low-dose radiation induced risks) Project.Materials and Methods: CBCT images of paediatric and adolescent patients were selected and evaluated among a total of 12494 CBCT images reviewed retrospectively. Data regarding age, gender, referring department, field of view (FOV), and CBCT indications were recorded. Based on an adaptation of European DIMITRA Project recommendations, CBCT indications were categorized as impacted teeth, trauma, orofacial clefts, dental anomalies, bone pathology, syndromes, and other indications. Follow-up CBCT examinations and incidental findings were also recorded. Data were statistically analyzed at p<0.05 significance level.Results: Most of the 1686 CBCT scans obtained from pediatric and adolescent patients were referred from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (31.2%), followed by the Departments of Orthodontics (25.9%) and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (24.6%). The most frequently requested FOV was the maxilla (35.1%) followed by the jaws (maxilla-mandible) (29.3%) and the maxillary canine-incisor region was the most commonly requested region among localised applications (83.1%). The most common indication was impacted teeth (33.5%) followed by bone pathology (32.7%). Follow-up CBCT examinations were recorded mostly for syndromes (33.3%) and orofacial clefts (20.4%).Conclusions: The use of CBCT should be justified on a patient basis and DIMITRA Project recommendations can guide dental professionals in referring CBCT in paediatric and adolescent population.

Makale Başlığı: A Group of Roman and Late Antique Bone Objects Found in Ancient Tralleis
Özet: Both ancient written sources and archaeological finds provide evidence that the ancient city of Tralleis was established on the plain of the southern skirt of Mount Kestane (Mesogis). The excavations performed at ancient Tralleis have unearthed the Gymnasium, the Northern and Western Workshops, the Western Necropolis, the Arsenal and the Villa Sectors, all of which are dated to the Roman era. Also uncovered is the Episcopal Church, which is dated to the Early Byzantine period. In this study, we will introduce a group of bone objects found in the excavations conducted in the Northern and Western Workshops of the Gymnasium and on the fill area at the exit of the Arsenal. The production of bone objects and workshops of ancient Tralleis will be evaluated. A total of 30 bone objects were unearthed during the excavation, and these were examined according to their forms and functions. In their preliminary evaluation we focused specifically on the role these bone objects played in the socio-economic structure of ancient Tralleis.

Makale Başlığı: Liver Plasmacytoma Mimicking Solid Tumor Metastasis in a Relapsed Myeloma Patient: Case Report and Review of the Literature
Özet: Aim: The prevalence of extramedullary disease increases as the survival of Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients prolong. Rarely, malign clones may involve the gastrointestinal system.  Nodular hepatic plasmacytoma is also rare and can be confused with solid tumor metastasis.  Here we present an interesting case of multiple nodular hepatic plasmacytoma in relapsed myeloma patient. Case: The diagnosis is confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and trucut biopsy of liver. If elevated liver enzymes are detected in a patient with myeloma, the patient should be evaluated for liver plasmacytoma. In case of doubt, imaging and biopsy should be performed.  Conclusion: We aim to draw attention to the findings of extramedullary involvement in MM patients.

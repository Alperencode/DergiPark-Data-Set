Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Mycorrhiza and Phosphorus Applications on the Development and Nutrient Uptake of Bell Pepper Plant in Two Different Growing Periods
Özet: In this study, in field conditions, it was aimed to determine the effect of inoculation of different mycorrhiza species on development of bell pepper plants which is depending on phosphorus dose applications. In the experiment, G. mosseae and G. etunicatum mycorrhiza species were inoculated with two phosphorus (P) doses (as non-phosphorus (P0= 0 kg P2O5/ha) and (P1= 80 kg P2O5/ha)) were applied. The study was carried out for two years in 1998 and 1999. After the plants were harvested, pepper yield, P and Zinc (Zn) concentrations in plant tissues and mycorrhizal root infection analyzes were done. According to the results obtained; While no effect of mycorrhizal inoculation and P application on yield was determined, exceeding mycorrhiza in 1988 had a positive effect on plant P and Zn concentrations. In both years, G. mosseae  mycorrhiza species was found to be more effective. On the other hand, no significant effect of P application on yield and nutrient concentration were found.

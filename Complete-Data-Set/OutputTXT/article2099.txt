Makale Başlığı: Turkish Validity and Reliability Study of the Functional Independence and Difficulty Scale in Older Adults
Özet: Aim: The present research aims to investigate the suitability of the Functional Independence and Difficulty Scale (FIDS) to the Turkish version and society and the efficiency of its clinical use and bring it into use for other researchers.Materials and Methods: One hundred forty older adults living in the society were enrolled in the research. The physical characteristics and clinical states of the individuals were recorded during their first evaluation, and their cognitive states were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The Turkish Version of the Functional Independence and Difficulty Scale (FIDS) was translated by professionals to investigate its validity and reliability. To test the validity, the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (Barthel ADL) and the Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (Katz Index ADL) were applied in the study. For the test-retest reliability, a retest was performed two weeks later by the same physiotherapist.Results: The ICC value of the FIDS was found to be 0.999 (95% CI; 0.995–1.000 excellent agreement).According to the correlation analysis, a high correlation was detected between the first and second assessments of the FIDS (p<0.0001). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was computed as 0.872.The scale’s internal consistency was observed to be very high (p<0.0001). A moderate positive correlation was revealed between the FIDS and the Barthel ADL (r=0.504, p=0.000) and between the FIDS and the Katz Index ADL (r=0.466, p=0.000). The factor analysis demonstrated a three factor structure that explained 59.01 % of total variance.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the Turkish version of the FIDS was valid and reliable in older adults.

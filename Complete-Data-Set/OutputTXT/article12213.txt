Makale Başlığı: A TWO-PHASE SOLUTION APPROACH FOR THE TRAVELING PURCHASER PROBLEM IN COLD CHAIN LOGISTICS
Özet: This paper introduces an extension of the well-known traveling purchaser problem in the literature by taking into account the procurement of perishable foods in cold chain logistics. The problem in which transportation operations are carried out based on the perishable product conditions is called the traveling purchaser problem in cold chain logistics (TPP-CCL). The TPP-CCL considers a set of perishable food demands to be purchased from a number of markets, where the foods have to be transported by a temperature-controlled vehicle. The aim of the problem is to find the best procurement and route plan for the purchaser that minimizes the total energy cost of the vehicle, damage cost of foods and purchasing cost. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and solved by using a two-phase solution procedure. In the first phase of the solution methodology, a rough solution is obtained through a solution construction method. Then the solution observed in the first phase is improved by using the GUROBI solver, where the solver is terminated at the end of a specific time limit. In the computational studies, the performance of the proposed solution methodology is analyzed on a benchmark problem set including different sized instances.

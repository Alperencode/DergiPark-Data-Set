Makale Başlığı: Functionalization of Architectural Heritage Buildings and Energy
Özet: The reuse of architectural products that preserve their structural features, even though they can no longer maintain their functions in today's conditions, is a useful approach in terms of evaluating the existing building stock. In addition to the historical and cultural values of the buildings, it is important that they are sustainable in terms of energy efficiency. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the re-functionalized architectural heritage buildings in terms of energy efficiency. Within the scope of the study, exemplary buildings with energy efficiency applications were examined in line with the determined qualifications. The location of the buildings, the façade features and the user behaviors during the life of the building are effective on energy efficiency applications. All these practices ensure that heritage buildings are reused as a sustainable choice, as well as sustaining their lives using less energy, minimizing the damage they cause to the environment, contributing to the development of sustainable development and maintaining the cultural heritage. As a result, this article, the priority option for the preservation of cultural heritage structures and transferring them to future generations; It envisages providing energy efficiency against climatic change by improving the environmental conditions of buildings while increasing the control level.

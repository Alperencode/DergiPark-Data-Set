Makale Başlığı: Evaluating Coding-Based Entertainment Applications in the Context of 21st Century Skills According to Teachers' Opinions
Özet: The purpose of this study is to assess teachers’ opinions about coding-based entertainment applications in the context of 21st-century skills. Teachers' opinions were analyzed using the Many facet Rasch measurement model. The study group of the research consists of 14 teachers working in different regions of Turkey. According to the Rasch measurement model, the study has three facets. The first of these facets is the teachers as 14 raters (judges). The other facet is six entertainment applications based on coding. The third facet consists of 11 items (criteria) established for these applications. In this study, coding-based applications such as Scratch, Code.org, CodeMonkey, CodeCombat, Mobil Kod (EBA), and mBlock were examined based on teachers' opinions. The analysis showed that the Scratch and mBlock applications had the highest quality while the Mobil Kod application had the lowest quality. In addition, it was found that through the use of coding-based applications, it may be difficult to develop students' understanding of solidarity and benevolence. On the other hand, teachers indicated that these applications arouse students' curiosity and interest in new developments and enable them to learn by doing. As a result of the analysis, it was also found that judges differ in terms of their severity and leniency. It is expected that the results of the study will contribute to this area.

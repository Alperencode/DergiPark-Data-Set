Makale Başlığı: On the administrative-territorial division and ethno-demographic processes in the Irevan province in the middle of the XIX - early XX centuries
Özet: In this article, the author considers the history of its administrative-territorial evolution during the assessment of the foundation of the Irevan province based on various topics, various authoritative sources, including numerous statistical collections, and available historical literature. Based on large numbers of archives, other documents and materials, it is convincingly proven that the official tsarist policy in the field of administrative administration was also purely colonial in the Irevan province. Whether in the governorship or district governorship, almost all staff consisted of Christians - Russians, Armenians, Georgians, etc. As a result of the mass migration of the Christian population from the Ottoman and Qajar empires to Northern Azerbaijan by the tsarist authorities, the share of the local, native Turkish public in the Irevan province gradually decreased, on the contrary, the share of the Christian population, especially the Armenians, increased irresistibly. It was due to the colonial intentions of the tsarist government, which sought to establish a "sanitary cordon" along its new southern borders with their empire, to inflict ethnic beatings on itself in Muslim areas. Research shows that the tsarist government achieved possible results in this area (which, unfortunately, must be admitted).

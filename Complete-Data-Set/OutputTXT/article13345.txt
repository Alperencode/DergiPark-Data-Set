Makale Başlığı: The representation of femininity and memory in Lisa Tuttle’s short story “Wives”
Özet: Gender roles internalized by patriarchal culture have brought gender hierarchy. Gender inequality arising from this classification has become a subject that many fiction writers deal with. As one of these works, American feminist-science fiction writer Lisa Tuttle's short story "Wives", written in 1979, offers a critique not only to the gender roles imposed by the patriarchal structure, but also to the social position of women through the views of the internalization of the male gaze and the memory of the body. In the story, men from planet earth infuse gender roles into the cultural memories of the beings on the new planet and eventually transform them into 'perfect' housewives. This study aims to discuss how gender roles are processed in the memories of these beings through the male-dominated system with the views of Susan Bordo and Sandra Lee Bartky, by considering the concepts of discipline and power in light of Michel Foucault. Since the work is also an example of feminist-dystopia, it will be discussed within the dichotomy of fiction and reality through Donna Haraway's views.

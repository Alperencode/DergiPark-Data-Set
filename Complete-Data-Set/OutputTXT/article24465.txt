Makale Başlığı: Kant's Theory of Arithmetic
Özet: Kant's arithmetic theory is very important both in general mathematical philosophy and in the understanding of critical philosophy. This is because Kant's view of arithmetic theory is a reflection of critical philosophy as a whole. However, in the majority of works on Kant's mathematical philosophy, the relation between geometry and a priori form space is discussed in detail, arithmetic and its relationship with time are relatively neglected. Whereas, to handle Kant's claims about the nature of arithmetic proposals independently within their own dynamics seems necessary and more reasonable. In this direction, we will try to examine Kant's arithmetic theory throughout our work.

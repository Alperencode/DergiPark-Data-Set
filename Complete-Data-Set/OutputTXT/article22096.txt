Makale Başlığı: Current Situation and General Problems of Small Ruminant Enterprises in Hakkâri Province
Özet: This study was carried out in order to reveal the current situation of small ruminant breeding enterprises (96 enterprises) in Hakkâri province. The survey data prepared for enterprises was formed from 129 questions. The survey data were evaluated with the SPSS statistical software program. It has been determined that Akkaraman sheep and hair goat are bred together in 59.4% of the sheep and goat farms in Hakkâri (p˂0.01). It was found that 59.4% of the enterprises had to buy to supply their feed needs (p˂0.05) and they mostly preferred alfalfa cultivation (37.5%) as a forage crop. 40.6% of small ruminant breeders stated that they did not receive livestock support. 87.5% of the breeders reported that the supports were insufficient (p˂0.01). Only 28.1% of the breeders expressed the pasture grass quality as good (p˂0.05). While 52.1% of the breeders reported that they had plateau opportunities, it was determined that they mostly (30.2%) went to the plateau in May (p˂0.05) and stayed for 6 months (40.6%) (p˂0.01). While the participation rate in the ram/goat mating period was 55.8%, in the rest (44.2%) rams and goats were kept in the herd throughout the year. Lambing took place in February (52.1%) the most, and mostly (41.7%) completely ended in April. Health/age (35.4%) and body size (33.3%) were found to be the most important criteria for breeder selection. It has been determined that the most important problems of small ruminant breeders are high cost of feed, insufficient pasture quality, problems in plateau activities and use of older men in breeding.

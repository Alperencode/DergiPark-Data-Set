Makale Başlığı: THE ISSUE OF CITIZENSHIP BEING THE UPPER IDENTITY IN TURKEY
Özet: Making a new and civil constitution has been on Turkey's agenda for a long time. One of the many debates on this subject is whether constitutional citizenship can be an upper identity; Because for some, citizenship may be an upper identity, while for others, it cannot. There is a reciprocal relationship between the concepts of identity, supra-identity and citizenship, and at the center is the individual who owns both identity and citizenship. An individual acquires the status of a citizen only when he concludes a legal contract with the state. However, the individual also has a cultural identity and he gains it through his relationship with the society. Therefore, citizenship expresses the individual's bond with the state, and identity with the society. However, there is also a relationship between society and the state, because society establishes the state or the state is based on society. Therefore, there is a relationship between citizenship and individual-society-state. Citizenship debates in Turkey are made politically or ideologically and come to the fore as a supra-identity issue. However, citizenship is not identity, but legal status; Identity is cultural, citizenship is legal. The main problem of the article is why citizenship, which is a legal status, is discussed as an identity issue in Turkey and whether constitutional citizenship can be a super identity.

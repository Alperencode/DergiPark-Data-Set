Makale Başlığı: A Case Study on Teaching Medical Terminology with  Flipped Classroom Approach
Özet: Objective: The aim of study is to investigate possible effect of flipped classroom approach on medical terminology instruction at the medical secretarial education. In parallel to this aim, the effects of the pre-course instructional materials and in-class activities, which are the two main components of the flipped classroom approach, on students’ perceived learning were examined according to students’ views and evaluations. Method: A case study research design was used in this study. The study was carried out, with 36 first year undergraduate associate degree students studying at the Ankara University Vocational School of Health, Medical Documentation and Secretarial Program. A questionnaire and one to-one interviews were implemented as data collection tools. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and triangulated with qualitative data gathered from the interviews. Results: The findings of this study indicated that among the pre-course instructional materials, the visuals and interactive terminology cards were effective on perceived learning of the students. Concerning in-class activities, perceived learning was increased through the four phases of instruction as individual phase, group phase, source-use phase and feedback. Conclusion: Based on the findings, it is found that students thought the variety of pre-course materials were enough, but they suggested improvements regarding the quality of those materials. It is suggested that those findings should be taken into consideration in future studies on medical terminology instruction, which will be designed with a flipped learning approach

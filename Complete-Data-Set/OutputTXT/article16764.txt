Herein, gaining national advantage in international trade in services is critical for each country.

In accordance with this purpose, cointegration analysis was carried out for the period of 1982-2020 by leveraging ARDL model. The results indicate that while divided roads, railways and the number of tourism operation certificated businesses have positive and significant impact on service export in Türkiye, the number of universities and medical institutions have negative and insignificant effect on service export in Türkiye.

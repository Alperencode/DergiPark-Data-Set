Makale Başlığı: Reflections of the Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912) in Urdu Poetry
Özet: The Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912) was an important war in the last period of the Ottoman Empire’s history. As a result of this war, the Ottoman Empire lost its last piece of land in North Africa, Italian colonialism started in North Africa, the balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean changed, and Italy became a powerful state. In the meantime, all Muslims were linked to the Ottoman Empire due to the Caliph being the chief spiritual authority of Islam. All Muslim states also sent financial and moral support to the Ottoman Empire, with the greatest support being given by the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. They supported Turks in various ways such as sending the aid they collected to the Ottoman Empire, coming to Ottoman lands as medical delegations and establishing field hospitals, and shaping public opinion by writing articles in newspapers about the situation of the Turks. All these have been reflected in the Urdu literature, and many works were written both in verse and prose about the Italo-Turkish war. This article will discuss the reflections of the Italo-Turkish War in Urdu poetry and examine how this war reflected onto the subcontinent.

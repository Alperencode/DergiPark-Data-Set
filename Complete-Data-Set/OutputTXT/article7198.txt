Makale Başlığı: Studies on Eurygaster Laporte, 1832 Species (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae) and Damage Situations in Cereal Cultivation Fields of Iğdır Province
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the Eurygaster (Laporte, 1832) (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae) species and their damage in the cereal cultivation areas of Iğdır province in 2015-2016. Sweeping net method was used for identification of Sunn pest species from 57 cereal cultivation fields in Aralık, Karakoyunlu, Merkez and Tuzluca districts between the periods from april to august. Overwintered adult Sunn pests and the nymphs were counted on 12 different points of each of the 24 wheat fields randomly using a ¼ m2 frame. The sucking rates (%) were identified through collection of average two kilograms of spikes from each field during the harvesting period of wheat. Sunn pest density at the wheat fields were identified as 4.69 and 2.97 nymph and OAS/m2 and the average sucking rates for grain were identified as 1.3% and 1.1% respectively for the years 2015 and 2016. However, it was observed that the sucking rates of the Sunn pests collected from the fields during the dough period of wheat cultivated in mountain villages of Tuzluca district were 3.3 % and 7.7 % for both years.

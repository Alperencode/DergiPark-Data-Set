Makale Başlığı: Gastrointestinal Bleeding In COVID-19 Infection: A case-control study
Özet: Aim: Since the gastrointestinal tract contains ACE-2 receptors, gastrointestinal symptoms, including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), are frequently seen during COVID-19 infection. In addition, the risk of GIB increases not only due to the virus but also to the drugs used during the treatment of infection. In this study,  we aimed to determine the frequency of GIB in patients being treated due to COVID-19 infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), and to examine the effects of anticoagulant, antiaggregant, corticosteroid, antibiotic, and antiviral treatments on bleeding risk. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included a total of 189 patients hospitalized due to the COVID-19 infection in the intensive care unit. Patients were analyzed according to the presence of GIB. The duration and doses of treatment with steroid, pulse steroid, anticoagulant, antiaggregant, and proton pump inhibitors were also analyzed. Intubation need and mortality rates were compared between GIB and without GIB.Results: GIB developed in 34 (18%) patients followed in the COVID-19 -ICU. Patients with GIB had longer use of steroids and anticoagulants than those without GIB (p<0.001 and p=0.005). The mortality rate was higher in those with GIB (73.5% vs 51%, p=0.027)Conclusion: It has been shown that the risk of GIB in patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 ICU is associated with the duration of anticoagulant and steroid therapy.  Therefore, we think that patients receiving these treatments should be followed up for the risk of GIB.

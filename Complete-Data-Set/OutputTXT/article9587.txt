Makale Başlığı: The Role of Local Governments in the Integration of Immigrants
Özet: Small and large-scale problems caused by migration at the local level, have entered the field of work of institutions with global and regional power in the international arena, central governments and specifically local governments, and these units have produced some policies for the solution of problems in urban space. In the context of the policies put into practice, the most concrete information reached in the study was to contribute to the correct understanding of the relationship between the migration adaptation and integration process and the local government units. In the context of this contribution, Turkey, which has been a key country in migration for the last 15 years, is in the main axis of the study. Therefore, it is necessary to produce rational solution proposals for the problems experienced in migration adaptation and integration. The aim of this research is to examine migration management and compliance policies in the context of legal and administrative regulations in Turkey and to discuss the issue on the basis of local governments. The inadequacy of examining the studies conducted in this field through local governments; the presence of a limited number of studies examined in the literature on migration, adaptation, integration and the relationship of local government constitutes the original value of the research.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of ECG, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters in patients with acute myocarditis at acute attack and clinical remission
Özet: Aim: The pathogenesis of myocarditis, which has high morbidity and mortality in childhood and adolescence, has not been fully elucidated. The pathogenesis of acute myocarditis is a complex process in which multiple agents play a role. We aimed to compare ECG, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters of patients during acute exacerbation of myocarditis and clinical remission.Material and Method: 144 patients (124 males, 20 females) with an acute myocarditis episode were included in the study (28 ± 5). These patients were called for control during the clinical remission period of 3-12 months. The ECG, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters of the patients were compared during acute exacerbation and clinical remission. QT and Tp-e ECG parameters were measured. In addition to routine biochemistry and hemogram parameters, troponin I, uric acid, CRP, sedimentation, TSH and cholesterol levels were measured. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured as an echocardiographic parameter.Results: When compared with the clinical remission Tp-e interval (p: 0.032), QT-max (p=0.014), QT-min (p=0.001), TSH (p<0.001), Trop (p<0.00), Urea (p=0.028), Alt (p=0.010), Ast (p<0.001), Wbc (p<0.001), Hb (p<0.001), Htc (p<0.001), Rdw (p<0.001), Plt (p<0.001), Mpv (p<0.001), Neu (p=0.003), Lym (p=0.013), Mon (p<0.001), Eo (p=0.003), Pdw (p<0.001), CRP (p=0.001), ESR (p<0.001), and HDL-C (p=0.002) were significantly changed in patients with acute attack myocarditis.Conclusion: ECG parameters, inflammation markers, and HDL cholesterol levels were significantly improved in the clinical remission in addition to the left ventricular ejection fraction during acute exacerbation of the patients. LVEF, ECG parameters, inflammation markers, TSH and HDL cholesterol levels were thought to be important in terms of clinical course and pathogenesis of the disease.

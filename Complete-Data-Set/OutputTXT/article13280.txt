Makale Başlığı: Curses in Bashkir Turkish
Özet: As in all other languages of the world, one of the most important elements of the Turkic languages is the vocabulary. Socio-cultural interactions, special patterns and terms used in the practices of beliefs in life, oral culture literature preserved in traditions transferred from generation to generation play an important role in the formation of the vocabulary that distinguishes a language from the other ones. Words about relationships, stereotypes, speech acts, which are mostly encountered in oral culture; Since they are structures that only make sense when said based on the current situation, they are the structures that attract the most attention. When one is in a dire situation, when they are wronged, and when they feel helpless, in order for them to be in a difficult situation against those who caused it and to experience the same or even worse than these bad feelings, the words "kargış, beddua, lânet" that they say in that situation are also worth the vocabulary. These elements need to be studied. Although curses in a sentence form were shown as a part with the name of "kargışlar" in the words that were molded in Bashkir before, there has been no study on its own that deals with these curses in its entirety. In this study, the evaluation of the words "kargış, beddua, lânet", which have a rich sociolinguistically rich concept area in Bashkir, which continues to keep its oral culture alive in the great Turkic Language family and always attracts attention with its oral literature, in terms of sound, shape and meaning will be done. On the basis of the ten-volume Bashkir Tiliniñ Academic Hüzligi(The Academic Dictionary of Bashkir), which reflects the vocabulary in a comprehensive way, the concept of confusion will be tried to be revealed by making use of other Bashkir dictionaries and other Turkic language dictionaries.

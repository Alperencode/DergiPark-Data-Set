Makale Başlığı: Heat transfer system and feedback temperature controller design for safety process operation of phosphorous acid potassium salts production
Özet: The phosphorous acid salts are widely used in the industry because of the effective treatment against various fungal diseases encountered in plants. The production process is exothermic and, with high temperatures around 94℃ achieved, significant risks were observed in terms of occupational health and safety. Therefore, the aim is to design a control system that will make this production process reliable for human health, economic and ecological damage. For this purpose, studies were carried out to determine the optimum operating mode, heat transfer system, and temperature controller design to prevent a sudden temperature rise. First, the overall heat transfer coefficient between the reactor and the jacket was determined as 51.0930 W/m2℃ and, the refrigerant was chosen as cooling water with 1.271 g/s flow rate which is relatively more economical and accessible. The model parameters of the system were determined with a detailed dynamic analysis by giving positive and negative step inputs to the cooling water flow rate and then obtaining model parameters through reaction curve and linear regression methods. By using the obtained model parameters theoretical P, PI and PID parameters were calculated by Cohen Coon and, Ziegler-Nichols approaches, and the success of controller parameters was tested, simulated with the MATLAB Simulink program and lastly, successful temperature control was achieved in the experimental system.

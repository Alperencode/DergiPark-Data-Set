Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF SECURITY DUTIES ON PERCEPTIONS OF ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE ON WORK MOTIVATIONS
Özet: The aim of the study is the effect of organizational justice perceptions of security duties working at Fırat University in Elazig on work motivations. While the universe of the study was composed of security officers working at Fırat University, the sample consisted of 182 security officers working at Fırat University, on the condition that it was limited to Elazig.Personal information form and "Organizational Justice Scale and Motivation Scale" were used to examine the organizational justice and work motivations of the security guards participating in the study, Frequency and percentage analyzes created by the statistical program were performed, t test in paired groups, analysis of variance (Anova) in multiple groups, and TUKEY test were used to find the differences between groups.	As a result; It has been observed that the marital status, age and working years of the security guards working at Fırat University have no effect on organizational justice and work motivation. According to educational status; It can be said that the administrators of the institution act fairly towards the private security officers whose graduation status is high school in terms of distributive justice and fair dealing. . Considering the work motivation, it was seen that the instrumental motivation of the university graduate security officers was higher than the high school graduate employees. We can say that the organizational justice perceptions of private security officers have positive effects on their work motivation, albeit at a low level.

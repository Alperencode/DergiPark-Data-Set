Makale Başlığı: AN OTTOMAN INTELLECTUAL REPUBLICAN INTELLECTUAL MUSICIAN: KAZIM UZ
Özet: There are cases waiting to be clarified in the field of Turkish music history, which has a deep-rooted past. Although studies on events and people support this enlightenment, there are definitely missing aspects. In the literature review, it has been determined that Kazım Uz, who is also known by names such as Muallim Kazım, Muallim Hoca Sakallı Kazım Uz, has an important place in our musical history. Serving the theoretical field of music especially with the books he published, Uz undertook the task of historiography with the articles he wrote in the journals of the period. Uz, who is an important figure with his life in the transition period between the Ottoman and the Republic, appears as an intellectual who took part in the side of Turkish music, especially on the subject of the Music Revolu-tion, which was wanted to be realized in the early Republican years. In this study, which was limited to the articles written by Kazım Uz in the journals of the period, Uz's musical perception was tried to be revealed by using the qualitative research methods of document analysis and data analysis.

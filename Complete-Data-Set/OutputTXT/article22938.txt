Makale Başlığı: THE ANATOMY OF NON-MIGRATION IN THE CONTEXT OF MIGRATION THEORIES
Özet: In this study, the situation of the non-immigrants, as well as the migration movements, which have turned into one of the biggest mass problems in the world in recent years, are discussed quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, practical ways to solve the immigration problem are proposed based on the psychology and social status of non-immigrants. The study was carried out in both qualitative and quantitative contexts, starting from the theories of migration, the theoretical basis of non-immigrant was tried to be revealed, as well as the migration movement, non-immigrant was explained with economic, political and cultural factors. For quantitative data in the study, 100 randomly selected people were interviewed among those whose relatives migrated but did not migrate, and the answers to the questions were categorized, evaluated and reported. Interviews were conducted with adult individuals living in Van, Diyarbakır, Batman, Bitlis, Artvin, Rize, Giresun, Balıkesir, Adana, Hatay. Although some of the answers seem to belong to a single category, it was noticed that there was a large background behind it, and some critical reasons behind the decision not to migrate were explained with academic views through in-depth interviews. As a result of the research, it has been discovered that migration is both a positive and negative movement. Accordingly, the concept of migration includes both staying in the origin geography and leaving the origin geography.

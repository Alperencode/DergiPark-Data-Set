Makale Başlığı: Investigation of 6-Year Land Use Change of Sakarya River Around İnhisar (Bilecik) using Remote Sensing
Özet: İnhisar (Bilecik) is located in the center-east of the study area, which is bounded by Söğüt (Bilecik) in the southwest and Yenipazar (Bilecik) in the northeast. Sakarya River, located in the center of the study area, provides continuity in the East-West direction for approximately 40 km and is fed by drains from both the north and the south. Marble enterprises with economic value are widely observed in the region. In addition, it is very important for the natural environment to protect areas such as İnhisar waterfall and Harmankaya Canyon Nature Park in the region from harm that may be caused by human activities. The main purpose of the study is to examine the areas with natural structures that are important for the environment on a regional scale with data provided by earth observation satellites and to define the time-dependent changes of these areas. Landsat-8 satellite images, a 12.5m-resolution digital elevation model and geology map constitute the main data of the study. The results of the change analysis conducted on the Landsat images classified with the random forest algorithm are discussed on the geology and topography maps.  When the 6-year change analysis findings are interpreted, it is suggested that the mining activities, which intensified especially around Gölpazarı, should not approach the Yenipazar-İnhisar line in the east.

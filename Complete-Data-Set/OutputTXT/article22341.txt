Makale Başlığı: Synthesis and structure analysis of the novel 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine substituted cyclotriphosphazene
Özet: In this study, the reaction of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene with 4-(2-aminoethyl) morpholine which is a primary amine was carried out in the presence of Trimethylamine in THF. The molecular structure of the final compound was confirmed by mass spectrometry, FT-IR, 31P, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The possible progress mechanism of the reaction was proposed using the structure analysis of the product formed.

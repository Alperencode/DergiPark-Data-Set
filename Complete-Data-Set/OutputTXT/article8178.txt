Makale Başlığı: Determination of Prospective Science Teachers' Behavioral Objectives Related to Out of School Learning Activities
Özet: The purpose of the research is to investigate prospective science teachers’ behavioral objectives about out of school learning. 204 prospective science teachers from different universities participated in this research. The research was carried out with the survey model, which is one of the quantative research methods. “Out of school activities realization scale” developed by Karademir (2013) was used as data collection tool. Whether prospective science teachers will apply out of school learning in the future can be estimated by determining how their behavioral objectives are now. Data analysis were done path analysis model and fit indices using the AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) program. As a result, prospective teachers’ goals for behavior are explained mostly by the effect of attitude towards behavior and least by the effect of subjective norms. Therefore, results display that changing prospective science teachers attitudes towards out of school learning will change their future behaviors related to out of school learning.

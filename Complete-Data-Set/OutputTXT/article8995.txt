Özet: Purpose: This study aims to determine the relationship between skin cancer and sun knowledge and sun protection behavior of adults living in Dikmen region.Methods: The type of research was cross-sectional. From the population served by the primary health care center (N=1078) located in Dikmen region, the sample of n=284 individuals who applied to the health center while the study was being conducted and volunteered to participate in the study were taken. The data were collected with the 'Socio-Demographic data form', 'Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale', 'Skin Cancer and Sun Information Scale' and 'Sun Protection Behavior Scale'. Frequency, percentage, mean, Independent t Test, One-way Anova and Pearson Correlation Test were used for data analysis. Results: Participants had the mean age of 49.04±17.65 and 53.2% of them were female. When the skin types of participants were examined according to the Fitzparick classification, it was found that 32.7% of them had average skin color and there were no individuals with very dark/black skin. The 'Skin cancer and sun knowledge scale' of the participants were determined as 12.88±2.51 (min:7.0; max:21.0). The total mean score of the participants in the 'Sun protection behavior scale' was 23.67±6.84 (min:8.0; max:40.0). A positive, weak, statistically valuable relationship was realized between the participants' overall mean score of the 'Skin Cancer and Sun Information Scale' and the total mean score of the 'Sun Protection Behavior Scale' (p<0.05). Conclusions: It is considered important to raise awareness of those working in hot climates and under the sun about UV and skin cancer.

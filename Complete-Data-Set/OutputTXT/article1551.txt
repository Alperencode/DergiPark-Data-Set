As a result of the research, although statistically positive changes were observed in 5-year education compared to 4-year education, it was seen that there are still areas that need improvement.

In addition to classical teaching methods, it was determined that it would be appropriate to use more catchy and problem-based methods, the importance of continuing internship practices and supervision, and finally, career management was better done in 5-year education. It is recommended to complete the identified deficiencies and increase the research.

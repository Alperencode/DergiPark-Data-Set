Makale Başlığı: BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF HOSPITAL INTERNATIONALISATION IN WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE
Özet: The study, it is aimed to determine the bibliometric features of the studies written and published on the subject of internationalization of hospitals published between 1994-2021 in the Web of Science database. For this purpose, all 64 publications in the Web of Science database were analyzed using the bibliometric analysis method within the framework of various parameters. As a result of the findings obtained from the research, it is seen that the studies on the internationalization of hospitals have increased in recent years and the subject has been studied in different disciplines. This situation can be explained by the successful management and efforts of both countries and hospital enterprises providing healthcare services in the international arena in recent years. The publications examined within the scope of the research are mostly in the fields of business, economics, health education, and health management. With the findings obtained as a result of the study, it is recommended not only within the scope of the internationalization of hospitals but also to fill the gap in the literature with sub-titles and to contribute to the national and international literature for future studies.

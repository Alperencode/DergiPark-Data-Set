Makale Başlığı: Development of Virtual Robotic Laboratory and Materials for Education and Research
Özet: Robotic era is near, has never been before. In this new era, robotic education must have quality and accessibility for everyone. In this study, a disruptive technology for future of distance education based on virtual robotic laboratory (U-Plat) is presented. The created robotics education platform allows users to access a virtual robotics laboratory and training programs using internet interfaces. This environment allows them to control simulated robots, analyze and evaluate the results of experiments performed. U-Plat gives researchers, students and people working in the field of robotics the chance to learn Robot Operating System (ROS) and increase their knowledge with robotics training from beginner to advanced level. Also, U-Plat gives researchers opportunity to try their codes in online platform. Compared to traditional learning methods, U-Plat can be seen as an easier and more effective learning/teaching platform for ROS exercises, as it is an open source system. The user experience has been tried to be provided in all training tools with a very simplified and easily understandable interface. All designed training tools are provided through a web interface supported by advanced cloud systems and Docker container infrastructure. As a result, U-Plat is a novel robotic learning platform that can lead future laboratory research and distance robotic education.

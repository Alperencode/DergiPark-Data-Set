Makale Başlığı: Bilateral Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head After COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report
Özet: Aim: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a condition characterized by limited range of motion,pain, and gait disturbance resulting from insufficient blood flow. We aim to evaluate the relationshipbetween COVID-19 and avascular necrosis.Case: Herein, we present a 63-year-old male patient who developed avascular necrosis of the bilateralfemoral head after COVID-19.Conclusion: COVID-19 infection alone and corticosteroids given to treat it can increase the incidenceof avascular necrosis of the femoral head. MRI of the hip is highly specific in detecting early stageavascular necrosis of the femoral head and can reduce patient’s disability and need for surgery.

Makale Başlığı: The Flexibility of Hadith Method in Sufism in (In the Context of Regâib Prayer)
Özet: Undoubtedly, the second source after the Qur'an in every field of religious sciences is hadith. The hadiths constitute an im-portant basis for the life and ideas of the people of Sufism. Authors who are people of Sufism have included hadiths extensively in their works since ancient times. This inevitably created a close relationship between Sufism and hadith. However, since the scholars of Sufism mainly deal with hadiths for the purpose of educating people and giving advice, they did not pay as much attention to the hadiths and texts as the hadith narrations, and they did not show meticulousness in the field of hadith sciences. Because the hadiths, like the people of mysticism, saw the hadiths as a means of guidance and did not narrate them for the purpose of advice. They mostly narrated the hadiths from the Prophet or the Companions with the aim of subjecting the hadiths to the criteria of hadith method and revealing the rules such as whether the hadith came correctly and whether it was sound in terms of degree, hasan or weak. As such, weak or legitimate hadiths were included in the works of some of the Sufis. In his works, the hadith about the prayer performed on the night of Regâib, etc. The famous mystic Imam Ghazali (d. 505/1111) and Abu Talib al-Makki (d. 386/996), who included the narrations, were criticized by the hadithists. In this study, we will try to deal with the approaches of sufi scholars and hadith scholars to hadith and hadith sciences in the context of this subject.

Makale Başlığı: THE LIMITLESSNESS OF POSTMODERNIST FICTION: THE EXAMPLE OF SAHIR
Özet: In general, postmodernism, which expresses an extremely wide intellectual movement, philosophy, world view, cultural condition, discourse, a form of interpretation and criticism, has manifested its most concrete and earliest examples in the field of literature. Contrary to traditional narrative techniques, postmodern fiction, which enables extremely innovative and unusual techniques, has brought issues related to fictionality into question by focusing on the ontology, or existence, of fictional narrative. The novel Sahir, which is a good example of postmodern fiction that deals with the ontology of the fictional text, has remarkable features both technically and thematically. The novel, built on a metaleptic structure, is a typical example of postmodern fiction, which refuses to adhere to ontological boundaries and hierarchies, blurs the borderline between fiction and reality, questions the authority of the “author”, and frequently employs irony, parody and intertextuality. Ontological metalepsis, which is at the center of the novel, has alienating, surprising and entertaining effects on the readers and also contains extremely serious thematic messages. In this study, firstly, the shift from epistemology to ontology, which is considered as the dominant feature of postmodern fiction, will be focused on, and then the novel Sahir, which is an example of a postmodern novel written by Ercan y Yılmaz, will be analyzed in terms of ontological issues, metalepsis and questioning the concept of author.

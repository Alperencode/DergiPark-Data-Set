Makale Başlığı: Comparison of the anxiety levels of teacher candidates during actual and 360° video virtual reality presentations
Özet: This study considers if the 360° video Virtual Reality (VR) environment is a less stressful alternative to giving actual presentations, and thus better able to support the development of the presentation skills of teacher candidates. Mixed method research was conducted in which 12 teacher candidates gave an average of 5 minutes of presentations on different days, both in a virtual and in a face-to-face school environment, before a group of listeners whom they hadn’t seen before. The candidates’ pulses were compared during presentations conducted in both environments, and the audio recordings were analysed with the PRAAT program. Further evaluation was conducted at the end of the process using an opinion form and interviews. No significant differences were found between the two groups, except in 2 of the 9 different voice analysis variables related to anxiety and the pulse of the candidates. The candidates generally felt that the 360° video VR experience was quite realistic, and that it could be an effective method of addressing concerns about giving presentations. It was therefore concluded that 360° video VR environments could be effectively used in teacher education as an alternative to the actual presentation experience.

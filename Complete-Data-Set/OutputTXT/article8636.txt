Makale Başlığı: The Past of Women from Istanbul: The Estates and The Attirement (1825-1850)
Özet: The life style of Ottoman women who live in either the palace or outside the palace has always been and still is an attractive topic. The daily life style of Ottoman women in 19. century (1825-1850) was studied to be uncovered partially in this study, too, specially on the basis of the clothes. In this perspective, the estates of eighty nine women, five of who are Muslim were examined. The fabric types used in clothes were also approached, partially while being examined the estates on the basis of woman clothes. The inside (home) and the outside (street) states of women existed in the society actively were revealed from time to time by making comparison of the classical and the modern period. It was aimed to be brought the ways of existence, the forms of appearances and accordingly the images of women in the social life out on the basis of the clothes. Our establishings pertained to nonmuslim women from the public due to that the estates mostly belong to the nonmuslims and the other than the ruling class and the rich. All of these were achieved from Mülga Beledi Kassamlığı in İstanbul Şer’iye Court Records Archive.

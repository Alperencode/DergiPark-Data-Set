Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Fly Ash on Adhesion and Compressive Strength of Waste Tire Additive Concretes
Özet: Due to the benefits it provides to concrete technology, environment and economy, the use of industrial by-products and waste materials such as fly ash and waste vehicle tires has been widely accepted in the construction sector. In this study, the effect of using 5%, 10% and 15% fly ash instead of cement as binder on the fresh and hardened properties of concretes where waste tire is used as 5%, 10% and 15% by volume instead of fine aggregate was investigated. Unit volume weight and consistency properties were determined in the fresh state, and adherence by the pull-out method, compressive and bending strength were determined in the hardened state. As a result, depending on the increase in the amount of tire, the unit weight of fresh concrete decreased and the amount of slump increased, while the compressive, adherence and flexural strengths and modulus of elasticity decreased in hardened concrete. However, fly ash substitution provided an improvement in compressive strength and prevented strength losses. The use of 10% fly ash increased the compressive strength by approximately 30% in concretes with 10% and 15% tire additives. Fly ash increased the adherence strength by 16% and 25%, respectively, in 10% and 15% tire additives. In general, 10% fly ash provided improvement by reducing strength losses in tire-added concretes. The use of fly ash and waste tire in optimum proportions contributes to the usability of tire additives in concrete technology by improving the physical and mechanical properties of tire-added concretes.

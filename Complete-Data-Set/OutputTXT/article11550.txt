Makale Başlığı: 3D modeling of car parts by photogrammetric methods: Example of brake discs
Özet: Re-measurement of existing, manufactured parts and re-creation of 3D models of these parts brought about the concept of reverse engineering. Reverse engineering has become a frequently applied and utilized concept in processes such as repairing damaged parts, improving used parts, and making new designs based on old parts. One of the main reverse engineering methods widely used by many engineering branches is photogrammetry. Photogrammetry, which includes a wide range of applications from professional cameras to mobile phones, is divided into branches such as terrestrial photogrammetry, aerial photogrammetry and underwater photogrammetry. The basis of all these categories is the concept of making measurements of a part, structure or region and modeling them in 3D, even if they involve different equipment and instruments. In this study, the 3D model of a rear brake disc of a personal passenger car was obtained using mobile photogrammetric methods. In the results section, the applicability of the method was examined in terms of cost, time and accuracy, together with the results of the accuracy analysis. It has been shown that the mobile photogrammetry method can provide easy applicability, low cost and high accuracy of 0.88 mm.

Makale Başlığı: The Connection between Human Nature, Ethics and Politics in Aristotle’s Thought
Özet: According to Aristotle, it is possible for man to reach its goal and realize its nature, that is, to be “human” in the real sense, by acting in accordance with the reason and virtue. However, the ability of a person to realize its nature by doing virtuous actions based on reason depends on the combination of certain social conditions as well as individual structural characteristics. It is the main aim, responsibility of politics, the political society (state) to create the set of circumstances necessary for individuals to realize themselves and actualize the human capacities they have. Therefore, politics and state are directly related to human nature and the realization of its eidos. However, every kind form of government of the state cannot create the appropriate conditions and environment necessary for the realization of human nature. In other words, there is a bond between the realization of human nature and the nature of politics which is impossible to break and this bond cannot be established in all types of political organization or form of government of the state. It is of vital importance not to think of ethics and politics separately in order for this bond to be established and for the emergence of a political society and state in which people can realize their nature. Therefore, this study aims to draw attention to the fact that the realization of human nature cannot be considered independently of ethics and politics, based on Aristotle’s thoughts. In this context it is important to listen to Aristotle’s thoughts, as it allows us to remember the relationship between human nature, ethics and politics, which is often ignored today, and to see why we need ethics in a social sense as well as personally.

Makale Başlığı: BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF CONSUMPTION RITUAL STUDIES
Özet: Although the consumption ritual is the subject of studies in different disciplines, it was included in the marketing field by Rook in 1985 within the scope of consumer behavior. The aim of this study is to evaluate the status of consumption ritual studies handled within the scope of marketing through quantitative bibliometric analysis. The study is the first bibliometric analysis that deals with consumption ritual studies within the scope of marketing. A bibliometric analysis of 165 scientific studies on consumption rituals collected from the Scopus database for the years 1985-2021 was carried out through VOSviewer, with performance analysis and mapping analysis. While genre articles stand out according to the number of studies, the field gained popularity between 2010-2019, the most studies were conducted in the USA, the most influential study is Cova and Pace (2006), the author is Belk, R.W., and the journal is Journal of Consumer Research. The structural and dynamic view of the area was revealed through mapping analysis. Through the findings, the most influential studies, authors, journals, universities, and countries in the field of consumption ritual were identified. The study reveals the intensity and orientation of consumption ritual studies within the scope of marketing. The relations between the regions, countries, and writers where consumption rituals are performed are explained with regionalism. This situation creates a conceptual basis for researchers who aim to study consumption ritual in the future.

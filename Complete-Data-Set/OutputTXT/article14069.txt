Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of the Impact of Bank Profitability On Risk Sensitivity of Islamic and Conventional Banks
Özet: This study examines how bank profitability measures affect the risk sensitivity of Islamic and conventional banks in the presence of risk spillovers that may occur in the global financial system. Using the quantile vector autoregression model, our sample includes 170 banks from 14 countries having a dual banking system from January 1, 2010 to March 1, 2020, right before the COVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic. We consider the Dow Jones Industrial Index, Volatility Index, and MSCI Emerging Market Index to measure the risk spillovers in the global financial markets. We measure bank profitability by banks' return on assets and return on equity ratios. Results reveal that overall there is no major difference between conventional and Islamic banks in terms of their risk sensitivities. However, we find that Islamic banks with low return on assets and equity ratios seem to be less affected by risk spillovers due to a shock in global financial indices compared to conventional banks and Islamic banks with high profitability ratios. Our findings suggest that bank-specific variables such as profitability ratios might provide important insights in analyzing the dual bank system.

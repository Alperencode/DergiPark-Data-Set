Makale Başlığı: Atypically localized glomus tumor causing anterior interosseous nerve syndrome: A case report
Özet: This article presents a 48-year-old male patient who presented with pain in the left forearm and weakness and clumsiness in the left hand of 6 months' duration. Flexor motor strength loss of the thumb and the index finger was present and neurophysiologic tests showed findings compatible with axonal injury in the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) innervated muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying lesion in the proximal forearm resembling a glomus tumor. Excision of the mass and release of the AIN were performed.  Histopathology confirmed a glomus tumor, and the patient remains asymptomatic at 1 year postoperatively. We stress the importance of imaging studies in patients when a suspected secondary nature of nerve entrapment is present. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0081This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: The Rise of Christianity in Lycia
Özet: The studies on the origins of Christianity and the development in the Lycia have been evaluated by scholars coming from different backgrounds in the three centuries’ chronological borders, but an integrative approach to how Christianity was adopted and through which elements, have not been put forward. In this way, the first aim of this study that focuses on between the first and the third centuries is to identify the question’s sources by evaluating the modern, the ancient and the archaeological sources from a critical perspective. Considering the given sources, the second aim of the paper is to answer how Christianity developed in the Lycia and which elements were employed in this natural process, which seems to have been a gap in the Lycian studies presented.

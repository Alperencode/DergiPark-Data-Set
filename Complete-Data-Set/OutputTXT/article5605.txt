Makale Başlığı: Examining the Carsharing System in Terms of Urban Transportation
Özet: With the increasing population in the world, individual vehicle ownership is increasing day by day. The increase in individual vehicle ownership causes heavy traffic jams in the city centers. In addition to traffic congestion, noise pollution, harmful gas emission, parking lot problems also increase. Besides, the fact that most of the vehicles use petroleum derivatives, which are a depleted energy source, pose big problems for the economy. In this context, various studies are carried out to reduce the use of individual vehicles and to prevent the mentioned problems. One of these studies is the carsharing system. In this study, the applicability of the vehicle sharing system was investigated by surveys of Erzurum Metropolitan Municipality personnel. The city is divided into certain regions, taking into account the locations of individuals' homes. Later, the carsharing model was created with the mobile application designed for individuals living in the region. Monthly total economic gain and savings per individual were calculated in the analysis made as a result of the model. Thanks to the study, it has been revealed that the carsharing system within the institutions provides feasibility and many advantages.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Paintings of Şeref Akdik in Erzurum Painting and Sculpture Museum and Collection together with a Group of Miniatures
Özet: The history of traditional arts in the history of Turkish culture dates back to many years ago. While carving and only rough drawings attracted attention in the first place, it developed in the following periods due to the changing conditions. Miniatures, which are important historical documents because they convey the truth, have also affected the development of Turkish painting in many ways. Miniatures, which are also a form of expression with figures, were attached to the text and found a place in manuscripts to illuminate the text, but later on, especially in portraiture, they began to be seen as non-textual depictions. Miniatures, which form an important group of Turkish book arts, illuminate the period they belong to in many ways. On the one hand, the socio-cultural and artistic features of the period are carried to the present, on the other hand, it contains important data for researchers interested in history, geography and architecture.In this context, a historical group of miniatures showing similar characteristics with the paintings of Şeref Akdik in Erzurum Painting and Sculpture Museum were analyzed together in many ways.

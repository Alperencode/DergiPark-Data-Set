Makale Başlığı: Does Tax Amnesties Raise Tax Revenues? Evidence from Intervention Analysis for Turkey
Özet: Although its history dates back to ancient times, the tax amnesty phenomenon, which has been frequently applied all over the world, especially in the last 50 years, has been the subject of intense political and economic debates. While the main political motivation of tax amnesty is to affect voter preferences, its main economic justification is to increase tax revenues. Throughout the history of the republic, which is approaching a century, many tax amnesties in different extents have been put into effect in Turkey. In this study, in which it was investigated whether these amnesty practices provided the expected enhancer effect on tax revenues in the post-1994 period, the findings obtained from the intervention analysis indicate that the said positive effect did not occur. However, it seems as if this result stemmed from the fact that the effect cannot be decomposed due to frequently applied amnesties, rather than the fact that tax amnesties are ineffective.

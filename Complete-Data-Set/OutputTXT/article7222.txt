Makale Başlığı: Determination of Mold Diversity of Some Fruits Sold in Eastern Turkey
Özet: Fungi that contaminate the fruits at stages such as ripening, harvesting, storage, transportation may cause deterioration and economic losses, and even some strains can produce mycotoxins known to be harmful to health. In this respect, it was examined that the mold diversity of some fruits sold in eastern Turkey. A total of 113 different fruits, both non-moldy and moldy, were collected and 395 strains were isolated and identified using classical methods from different parts of the fruits (surfaces, core cavities and rotten parts). It was found the 11 different genera of fungi including Penicillium spp. (34.43%), Cladosporium spp. (22.53%), Rhizopus spp. (21.01%), Alternaria spp. (8.10%), Botrytis spp. (7.34%), Aspergillus spp. (2.27%), Byssochlamys spp. (1.52%), Acremonium spp. (0.76%), Fusarium spp. (0.76%), Colletotrichum spp. (0.76%), and Geotrichum spp. (0.51%) in the analysed strawberry, grape, apple, cherry, pear, plum, pomegranate, apricot, peach, orange, tangerine, and quince fruits. It is noteworthy that the fungi known to produce mycotoxins such as Penicillium expansum and Penicillium italicum are among the fungi isolated within the scope of the study.

Makale Başlığı: Strength Test on Coat Hangers
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the coat hangers made of 2 different materials such as wood and plastic to evaluate the strength values, deformation amounts and deformation points of the coat hangers Wooden coat hangers are, highly recyclable and sustainable when compared to plastics. TS 9215 standard was used to measure strength properties. The experimental setup created according to the TS 9215 standard formed the model of the research and experiments. In the experiment, a total of 16 coat hangers, 8 of which were made of wood and 8 of which were made of plastic, were used. Each coat hanger was hung in the experimental setup for 8 hours with 5 kilogram masses hung from 3 points in accordance with the standard and were checked every 2 hours. The deformations formed as a result of the experiment were observed. Observed deformations was first photographed and then precisely measured with a millimetric ruler and noted. The metric data obtained were analyzed in M. Excel program and transformed in to tables and graphics. It has been observed deformation of the hook parts of the coat hangers made of both types was higher than the strength deformations body part of the coat hangers. The results obtained in this study showed that wooden coat hangers have higher strength and lower deformation index than plastic coat hangers. In addition, it has been determined that the wood material used in wooden coat hangers has a great effect on the strength properties. In this study, when comparing alder and eucalyptus species on wooden coat hangers, alder was found to be more durable

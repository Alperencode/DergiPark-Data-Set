Makale Başlığı: THE VALIDITY OF THE RECORDS REGARDING THE CHOICE OF LAW IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE CONTRACT PREPARED BY THE TURKISH EMPLOYMENT AGENCY
Özet: Today, many workers from Turkey are taken abroad for the performance of the works undertaken abroad by Turkish entrepreneurs. The Turkish Employment Agency has also prepared a printed foreign service contract to provide a minimum protection for the workers who are taken in this way.Provisions regarding the choice of law are included in foreign service contracts. The validity of the choice of law contracts in foreign service contracts is subject to Turkish law, lex fori. Since the provisions of the foreign service contracts prepared by the Turkish Employment Agency can be accepted as general terms and conditions, the validity of the records regarding the choice of law must also comply with the conditions sought for these general terms and conditions. In this context, the validity and content of the records regarding the choice of law are subject to control.Within the scope of this study, the validity of the choice of law records included in foreign service contracts will be examined.

Makale Başlığı: TBL-MAC: A New Media Access Control Protocol Design for Linear Wireless Sensor Networks
Özet: In Linear Wireless Sensor Networks (LWSNs), which has taken its place in the literature as a special type of Wireless Sensor Networks, the nodes are arranged in a sequential manner in the network structure and the communication environment is created in a linear order. It is important that the Media Access Control (MAC) protocols to be developed for such applications are designed in accordance with the linear sequence characteristics. Because as the number of nodes in the network increases, the end-to-end delay of the packets and the data traffic of the nodes close to the coordinator node reach very high levels. In addition, increasing the number of nodes increases the probability of collision and congestion. For all these reasons, protocols developed for linear topologies are expected to have characteristics that are delay sensitive, can be connected seamlessly, and transmit data to the center without error. In this study, TBL-MAC, an agile MAC protocol that effectively overcomes the connection continuity of the network in difficult physical conditions, has been developed in order to minimize the above-mentioned LWSN problems. With this study, it was aimed to bring many innovations that will contribute to Linear Network communication to the literature, and the validity of the suggestions was tested by simulating the protocol. According to the simulation results, it is thought that the methods included in the TBL-MAC protocol will be accepted and the study will bring new perspectives to the researchers.

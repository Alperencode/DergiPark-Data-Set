Makale Başlığı: Phytochemicals and Proximate Compositions of Cocoa-based Silage
Özet: Presently,  agro-industrial by-products  are  used  as  livestock  feeds.  There  is  a  need  to determine  the  nutritional  properties  of  these  products  prior to  using  them  as  animal  feeds. The   qualitative   phytochemical   analysis   revealed   the   presence   of   tannins,   Phenol, Phlobatannins and Resin. Proximate analysis showed that the fermentation had significantly increased  the  Protein  (15.90-22.12%),  Carbohydrate  (16.37–45.26%),  Calcium  (26.09 –35.81ppm),  Phosphorus  (1.14–1.18ppm),  Potassium  (2.79–2.98ppm),  Butyric  acids  (2.59–3.11μg/100g), Gallic acids (0.01–0.11mg/kg) and Caloric values (1x103 to 11.5x103KJ/kg) of the silage from Diet 1 to Diet 5(0-100% cocoa pod and cassava pulp). The highest value of crude protein (22.12%) was observed for Diet 5 (50-100% cocoa pod inclusion). Diet 5(50-100% cocoa pod) also had the lowest value for crude fiber(6.08%); fat (0.88%) and highest value  for Calcium (35.81ppm) and calories values (11.50 x 103KJ/kg). This result showed that the combinations were a promising source of protein in animal diet if well processed. All the concentrations of anti-nutrients were found to be within acceptable levels for human and animal consumption.

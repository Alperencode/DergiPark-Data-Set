Makale Başlığı: Determination of the effectiveness of mycorrhiza, vermicompost and fertilization on tomato pith necrosis disease
Özet: Aims: The effectiveness of single, double and triple combinations of mycorrhizal fungi, vermicompost and potassium fertilization in tomatoes against the Pith Necrosis Disease caused by Pseudomonas cichorii were investigated in glass greenhouses with pot experimentsMethods and Results: The vermicompost, prepared at the dose recommended by the producer, was mixed with the soil at the rate of 20%, and seven mycorrhizal fungi species, which were produced in the clover plant, were mixed equally and applied to the planting pit of the tomato seedlings at a rate of 100 g per seedling, in contact with the roots. Potassium sulfate fertilizer prepared at a dose of 300 ppm was given after the tomato seedlings were planted. As a result of this study, all of the applications were successful by suppressing the disease at a rate of 52-74%. The most successful application was the Mycorrhiza application, which suppressed the disease by 74%. Vermicompost application prevented the disease by 71%, vermicompost+mycorrhiza and vermicompost+potassium application by 69% and mycorrhiza+potassium application by 68%. Other successful applications were obtained in triple combination with 62% and potassium fertilization alone with 52%.Conclusions: It was determined that vermicompost, mycorrhiza and potassium fertilization applied to tomato plants, both alone and in combination, was successful in preventing the Pith Necrosis Disease caused by Pseudomonas cichorii between 52-74%. Since there is no chemical control of the Pith Necrosis Disease, plant activators stimulating the resistance mechanisms of plants and applications that enrich the microbial activity of the soil are important in terms of suppressing the disease and it is recommended to include these applications in the integrated control program of the disease.Significance and Impact of the Study: This study has shown that these applications, which increase soil microbial activity, improve plant nutrient uptake and stimulate resistance to diseases, can be used successfully in the control of Pith Necrosis Disease.

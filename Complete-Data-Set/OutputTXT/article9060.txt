Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Science and Mathematics Textbooks in Context of Digital Competence
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the content of the textbooks between the 5th- 8th grade science and mathematics textbooks in the context of digital competence. Textbooks MoNE publications in the 2020-2021 academic year were used and document analysis method was preferred. For data analysis, a checklist was created by using the digital competence criteria published in the MoNE curriculum. To the findings, there is very little attention on the content for digital competence in Science and Mathematics textbooks. The content is mostly oriented "access to information" and digital-oriented content is in the book chapters mostly took part in the "unit sections.". There is no increase in the content for digital competence as the grade level increases and no content for "retention of information" and "presentation of information" at any grade level. Also there are significant differences in the content of the textbooks at the same grade level in the context of digital competence. To fill the main gaps between the learning goals and textbooks in the context of digital competence and to create related content for the dimensions, a digital competence framework of our country should be.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Fatigue, Care Dependence and Affecting  Factors in Hemodialysis Patients
Özet: Aim: The research was planned to determine the fatigue and care dependency levels of hemodialysis patients and the factors affecting them.Methods: The research was carried out as a descriptive study with 70 patients who were treated in the dialysis service of Adıyaman University Training and Research Hospital between December 2021 and January 2022 and met the inclusion criteria. The data of the research; It was collected with the “Personal Information Form”, “Fatigue Severity Scale” and “Care Addiction Scale”. Number, percentage, mean, Mann Whitney U, Kruskall Wallis and Spearman correlation tests were used in the statistical analysis of the data. After detecting the differences, post hoc tests were applied.Results:In our study, 30.0% of the hemodialysis patients participating were in the 36-50 age range, 57.1% were women, 42.9% were primary school graduates, 55.7% were single, and 50.0% were housewives, It was seen that 92.9% of them were not working and 54.3% of them were equal to their income and expenses. In the study, the mean fatigue severity scale of the patients was 45.58 ± 12.84 and the mean of the addiction scale was 70.71 ± 16.29. While it was observed that the fatigue severity scale score averages of the hemodialysis patients participating in the study differed statistically significantly according to age, gender, education level, occupational groups, the status of going to hemodialysis alone and having a chronic disease in addition to CKD (p<0.05), it was found that the mean scores of the care addiction scale showed a statistically significant difference according to age, employment status, income level, the status of entering hemodialysis alone and physical disability. In the study, as a result of the correlation analysis between the fatigue severity scale and the care addiction scale, it was determined that there was a weak negative relationship between the two variables (r= -0.258, p = .031).Conclusion: Nurses should plan their nursing care and training plans by considering the fatigue and possible care dependency in hemodialysis patients.

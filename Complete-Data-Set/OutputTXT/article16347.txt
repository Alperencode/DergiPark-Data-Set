Özet: The quality of life in cities is one of the most attractive research cases for researchers and urban planners. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) is one of the most recent multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM). In this study, we have tried to rank the quality of life in districts 1, 2, 3 & 8 of Tabriz city by using a combination of BWM and TOPSIS methods and Geographic Information System (GIS) capabilities. Twenty criteria have been considered for this study. At first, criteria map was prepared by using Remote Sensing processes and GIS. Then criteria weighting was determined by using the BWM method. After that, by combining the acquired weights by the TOPSIS method, the ranking of the districts was discovered. The results of BWM showed that the most effective criteria in quality of life is paying attention to the future of the city (%12.33). As a result of the quality of life analysis, it was revealed that district 2 has the best quality and district 3 has the worst quality. According to the prepared map of the quality of life, the best districts were Elahi-parast, Mirdamad 2 and Rajaea Shahr 2. On the other hand, the worst districts were Zangouleh Abad, Islam Abad 1 and Islam Abad 2.

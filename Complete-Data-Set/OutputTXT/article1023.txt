Makale Başlığı: The Role of GRI 302 Energy Reporting Standard in Energy Accounting: A Research on Sustainability Reports of Companies in The BIST Sustainability Index
Özet: The study investigates the relationship between “Energy Accounting”, “GRI 302: Energy” sustainability reporting standard, and sustainability reports in the context of energy sustainability, and aims to determine the role of GRI 302 Energy Reporting Standard on Energy Accounting. Energy is one of the fundamental inputs for sustainable development and has emerged as a strategic resource. Because energy is required for every production, productive and efficient energy use becomes increasingly important in terms of sustainability. As a result of this study, which has been conducted to determine whether the "GRI 302: Energy" standard explanations have been followed in the sustainability reports examined using the content analysis method, it has been determined that 94.64 percent of the sustainability reports did not include all the explanations.

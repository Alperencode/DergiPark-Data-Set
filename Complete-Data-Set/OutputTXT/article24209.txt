Makale Başlığı: The efficacy of Preoperative Administration Single Dose İntravenous Tranexamic Acid in Reduce Blood Loss in Total Knee Arthroplasty; Prospective Clinical Study
Özet: To analyse the effectiveness of single dose of 20 mg/kg intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA), in reducing the blood loss in the patients who will undergo a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Material and Method: 70 patients (65.5 ± 8.1 years old) that have undergone TKA were divided in two groups. The 20 mg/kg IV TXA was given before the skin incision to one group (study group). On the control group, TKA was performed without TXA. The demographic data, body mass index, amount of bleeding and erythrocyte infusion during the operation, haemoglobin and haematocrit values (preoperative and 48th hours), the amount of drained after the operation were reviewed. Results:The total amount of bleeding in the study group was 634.03 ± 182.88 ml and 1166.42 ± 295.92 ml in the control group (p<0.001). Peroperative bleeding was 252.01 ± 144.13 ml in the study group and 431.33 ± 209.10 ml in the control group (p=0.018). The drainage after the operation was 311.11 ± 141.64 ml at the 24th hour in the study group, 640.74 ± 279.43 ml at the 24th hour in the control group (p<0.001). The drainage after 24th hour was 97.96 ± 115.86 ml in the study group and 112.96 ± 64.43 ml in the control group (p=0.584). Conclusion:A high, single dose of TXA intravenously given to the patient prior to the TKA significantly reduces the bleeding during the operation and the period of 24 hours after the operation. There is no significant change in the bleeding after the 24th hour. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0269This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: Stabilization of Dredged Materials Using Cement and a Pozzolanic Binder Mineral Additive
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to stabilize the dredged materials with low bearing capacity, brought from Edirne, by using cement and pozzolanic binder mineral additives. In the first stage of the study, the geotechnical properties of the dredging materials were determined. Then, the optimum water contents and maximum dry unit weight values of the soil samples without additives and with different additive ratios were found by compaction tests. Pure and additive unconfined compressive  samples were prepared with the optimum water contents obtained in the compaction tests. Samples were prepared by adding 8%, 10% and 12% cement and 2% pozzolanic binder additive by weight to the dredged materials. Unconfined compressive tests were performed on the samples at the end of instant, 1-day, 7-day and 28-day curing periods. In addition, soaked CBR, permeability and flexural tests were performed on 12% cement+pozzolanic added samples. As a result of the experiments, with the addition of cement and pozzolanic binder additives in different ratio to the dredged  materials, permeability decreased, unconfined compressive strength, soaked CBR values and flexural strength increased significantly.

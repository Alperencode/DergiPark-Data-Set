Makale Başlığı: Nomination of Anatolian Seljuk Madrasahs in UNESCO World Heritage List: Management Plan Baseline Draft of İnce Minare Madrasah Case
Özet: Thanks to the UNESCO World Heritage Lists (WHL) and Tentative Heritage Lists (WHTL), among cultural properties, those that have outstanding universal value are nominated as the common property of all humanity. With this research, a draft area management plan was prepared for the Anatolian Seljuk Madrasas, included in the WHTL in 2014, to be nominated for the WHL. The research aims to detail the Ince Minare Madrasah, Konya, among these madrasahs, and to guide the others within the framework of the area management plan. Field studies, archival, and literature research were the main methods. The importance and value of the madrasahs were identified and action plans were developed to ensure sustainable conservation and enhance their values. This study is important because it could be a basis for preparing a holistic management plan, developing a sustainable conservation system, and increasing their protection as a common property of all mankind.

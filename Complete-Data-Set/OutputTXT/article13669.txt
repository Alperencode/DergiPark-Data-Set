Özet: Postmodernism, defined in the 20th century, has developed a perspective that questionsmodernity. According to this; Definitive definitions, defined genres belonging to modernism have beendeconstructed, and concepts such as experimentation, interspecies, and fragmentation have come to the fore.In theater art, this point of view has led to the postdramatic theater concept after the theatrical with a newquestion of essence and form. Postdramatic theater, on the other hand, has created its visual language in thehands of practitioners trained in other arts such as Castellucci. The Italian artist is a director who has attractedattention with interdisciplinary performative works since the 2000s. This article centers on the semioticexamination of the Paris episode of Romeo Castellucci’s performance in Tragedia Endogonidia. Castelluccidefends the human species journey that created its own destruction through the use of fictional indicators.In this episode, the journey of genealogical destruction starting from the archaic ages to postmodernism isconveyed by the destruction and reconstitution of signs. This research aims to find the essence of the director’sepisode of “Paris” by analyzing it semiotically. Thus, thanks to the example of Tragedia Endogonidia, it aims toreveal an approach to the components and indicators of the postdramatic theater and how they are formed ina theatrical performance.

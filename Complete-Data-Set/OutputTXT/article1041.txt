Makale Başlığı: AS A DETACHMENT PROCESS: SCHOOL ALİENATİON
Özet: The concept of alienation, which occurs because of the individual's separation from himself and his social environment, is a phenomenon as old as the history of humanity. Alienation, which is the subject of research by various disciplines such as philosophy, sociology, and psychology, has also been examined by many thinkers and philosophers. One of the areas where alienation occurs is education. Alienation in education is defined as the student's lack of sense of belonging and attachment in the school environment, and this situation is expressed as alienation from school. Alienation from school is the separation of the student from the learning process and away from the activities or communities that he/she should be in. The student who is alienated from the school may start to exhibit different behaviors after a while. This situation manifests itself with actions such as disrupting the order of the lesson, low academic achievement, truancy and not getting along with peers. As a result, alienation from school can cause students to break away from school, friends, and families.

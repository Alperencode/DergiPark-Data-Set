Makale Başlığı: Hyponatremia due to duloxetine use in an elderly woman patient
Özet: Hyponatremia is a potentially dangerous side effect of antidepressants. Almost every antidepressant can cause hyponatremia. Duloxetine-induced hyponatremia is a side effect that is usually seen in older women.  In addition to advanced age and female sex; low body weight, presence of comorbid diseases are other important risk factors for the development of hyponatremia. In this case report we present a patient with depressive disorder who developed hyponatremia with duloxetine treatment which resolved immediately after the cessation of the medication with supportive electrolyte treatment. In our case, the resolution of hyponatremia with supportive electrolyte treatment in addition to the cessation of duloxetine reminds us about the importance of monitoring sodium levels both before and after antidepressant treatment in geriatric populations.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of the Silage Quality of Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) Varieties Grown with Different Row Spacing Under Dry Conditions
Özet: While quinoa seeds are widely used in human nutrition, its herbage has become preferred in animal nutrition in recent years. However, when dried, the leaves of quinoa shed and crumble and also its stems become hard. This limits the use of quinoa as a dry herbage to reduce its digestibility and palatability. For this reason, the use of quinoa herbage as silage has been seen as an advantage. With the current research, it was aimed to determine the silage quality performances of two quinoa cultivars (Sandoval Mix and Oro de Valle) grown in 4 different row spacing (17.5, 35.0, 52.5 and 70.0 cm) in dry conditions. For this purpose, a three-replication trial was planned according to the factorial experiment design in randomized blocks in 2021. As a result of the study, it was observed that the dry matter ratio, required pH, lactic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid ratio were higher in Oro de Valle than Sandoval Mix, but leaf/stem ratio, crude protein, crude ash and acetic acid ratio were lower. When evaluated in terms of row-spacing, it was determined that dry matter ratio and the required pH decreased as row spacing increased, while the leaf/stem ratio, crude protein, ADF, raw ash and acetic acid ratio increased. These results showed that the sowings should be done in narrow row spacing and Oro de Valle can be used as silage material for a quality silage. However, it was concluded that additives that decreased ammonia production and pH and increased lactic acid production should be used for a better quality quinoa silage

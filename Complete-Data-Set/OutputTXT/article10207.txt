Özet: Straining movements, repetitive movements, vibration, staying in inappropriate posture for prolonged periods cause complaints such as pain in the in the musculoskeletal system, injuries, sprains, hernia, tears and soft tissue injuries. Complaints of excessive strain and frequent repetitions over time can suddenly arise, causing a work injury. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the working postures of textile factory workers and whether they affect work injuries or not. The postures of the workers during the job were analysed by videotaping them. Of all the participants (n=101), 75.2% were female, mean age was 33.4 ± 5.35 and 54.5% were high school graduate. Working experience mean was 8.53 ± 5.82 and the frequency of work injury was 18.8%. 57.8% of the workers in the textile industry exhibited a normal working position in category C1, 41.2% in C2, 0.5% in C3 and 0.1% in C4. However, it was observed that the educational level of workers who had experienced the WI was higher than the others and as the working experience increased the possibility of having injuries was statistically meaningful (p=0,014). In order to prevent work injuries in the textile industry, it is necessary to give in-service training about work safety to increase the awareness levels of females regardless of educational level.

Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Modern Society and Violence: Sociological Film Reading of 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance
Özet: In the conformist lifestyle offered by modernization, people who have everything, move away from emotion and sensitivity and lose their values and meaning in daily life. People who work continuously in the capitalist system, with consumerizm, are exposed to the violence of the media and television, and the individualization in life becomes mechanized by routine and monotonous living and continuing their daily routines with no communication and in loneliness. This collapse which emerges as an individual-sized crisis, is reflected in a social dimension, and the phenomenon of violence in modern societes that seems to be a cause is actually part of a social erosion. Within this context, Austrian director Michael Haneke, who examines the problems and pains of modern societies in his films, confronts the audience in the most realistic way with the dimensions of social corruption, unhappiness and despair in modern life. In this study, it is aimed to reveal the place of violence in the social structure of modern societies by making a sociological reading of Michael Haneke's film  "71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance" through the concepts of loneliness, lack of communication and alienation.

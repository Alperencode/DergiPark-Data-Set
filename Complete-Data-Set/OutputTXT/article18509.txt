Özet: This article discusses the identification of the wajhs regarded as weak in Kâsım b. Fîrruh esh-Shâtıbî’s poetical book Ḥırzu’l-emânî wa wajhu’t-tehânî that he wrote to make the differences of seven recitations (kırâ’ât-i sebaʻ) easy to memorize and the status of the practice of these wajhs in the Recitation Education. It is understood that Shatibi weakened these wajhs, sometimes explicitly with expressions such as leyse müʻavvelâ (لَيْسَ مُعَوَّلاَ) and lem yeṣıḥḥa fe yuḥmelâ (لَمْ يَصِحَّ فَيُحْمَلاَ), and sometimes indirectly with words such as yüftelâ (يُفْتَلاَ)”, helhelâ (هَلْهَلاَ), uḫmilâ (اُخْمِلَا)” and mâce (مَاجَ)”. It is seen that there are eight of these wajhs in total; two of them are about method and six of them are about farshi differences. First of all, in the article the relevant wajhs are divided into two as the differences in the method and fersh. Afterwards it is narrated how these wajhs were handled in the significant sources of the qiraat field in addition to the interpretation style of the shârihs whom were accepted as authority in Ḥırzu’l-emânî. Finally, it is remarked that the wajhs of the tarîqs of Istanbul and Egypt which are in circulation in our country moreover the conditions of the practice of these wajhs in the qiraat education activities which are run in Arab world.

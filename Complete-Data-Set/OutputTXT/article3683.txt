Makale Başlığı: Taking Stock of the COVID-19 Working Conditions on the Performance of the Interpreters: Rendering the Numbers in the 2020 American Presidential Debates
Özet: The paper investigates the rendition of numbers in the first American Presidential Debates from English into Turkish for two broadcasting institutions. Comparing the source and target texts, we examine the rendition of numbers under the COVID-19 working conditions. In an attempt to address this question, semi-structured interviews with the interpreters of the Presidential Debates are corroborated with corpus analysis. The findings seem to suggest that numbers were either omitted or misinterpreted to a large extent in an atmosphere different from face-to-face working conditions.  In conclusion, the paper shows that the interpreters’ inability to assist each other exacerbated the error rate as the interpreters did not prioritize numbers over other components of interpreting.

Makale Başlığı: DEVELOPMENT OF KNITTED AND WOVEN FABRIC FOR MEDICAL TEXTILES
Özet: In this project, it is aimed to develop technical textiles with sufficient antimicrobial properties with high usage performance. Within the scope of the study, both antimicrobial fibers and silver-added chemicals were used to gain these properties. Accordingly, within the scope of the project, cotton, silver fiber, tencel, bamboo, polyester, polyester coolmax and polyester antibacterial yarns were used by using 2 different spinning methods (Ring and Vortex) from 3 different yarn counts (Ne 40/1, Ne 30/1 and Ne 17/1) yarns are produced. Knitted and woven fabrics were produced from these yarns. Knitted fabrics have been produced in three different constructions (single jersey, interlock and 2-thread) and with different yarn mixtures. Woven fabrics, on the other hand, are produced in two different constructions (1/1 plain and satin) and using different weft and warp yarns. Antibacterial and water-repellent finishing processes 6 Carbon was applied to the knitted and woven fabrics. Performance tests, thermal comfort measurment and antibacterial activity, bacterial filtration efficiency, breathability (Pressure Difference) and Bioburden tests were performed on the developed fabrics. When the results obtained were examined, the knitted fabric (A) and knitted fabric with silver fiber (B1) sample completed all the measurements successfully.

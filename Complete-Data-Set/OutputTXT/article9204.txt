Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation-based upper extremity exercises on upper extremity physical fitness parameters and shooting performance in archers
Özet: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) in addition to scapular stabilization exercises on upper limb physical parameters and shooting performance in archers.Methods: Thirty-two archers aged between 9-14 were included in this study. Participants were randomly allocated to control or study group. Scapular stabilization exercises were given to the control group (n=16) and PNF exercises added to the study group (n=16). Participants completed a 6-week exercise protocol, three times per week. Hand grip strength (hand-held dynamometer), scapular muscle strength (Hand-Held dynamometer), upper extremity explosive power (medicine ball throw test) and endurance (push up test) and shooting performance were evaluated before and after exercises.Results: Scapular muscle strength, upper extremity explosive power and endurance and shooting performance values were significantly increased in the control group (p<0.05). Scapular muscle strength, upper extremity explosive power and endurance, reaction time, and shooting performance values were significantly increased in the study group (p <0.05). When the control group and study group are compared, the increase of shooting performance is found in study group favor.Conclusion: It has been shown that scapular stabilization exercise program can be effectively used in archers for improvement of upper extremity function and performance; with addition of PNF exercises to training, it was determined that more improvement was achieved in shooting performance.

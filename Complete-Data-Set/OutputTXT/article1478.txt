Makale Başlığı: Pandemic and Irregular Migration: A Critical Review of the European Union’s Irregular Migration Policy on the basis of the Turkey and Libya Deals
Özet: This study critically reviews the European Union’s (EU) irregular migration policy based on the Turkey and Libya deals’ performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study has two main findings about how the pandemic has affected the deals’ performance especially as to international cooperation and irregular migration management capacities: 1) The deals have failed in terms of sustainability and resilience. 2) The deals - aiming to reduce the irregular migration flows, improve access to protection, strengthen the international cooperation on irregular migration – have undermined the humanitarian and international cooperation. In conclusion, the study argues that strengthening the migration management capacities in transit and source countries as well as improving the humanitarian and international cooperation will be beneficial to overhauling of the EU’s irregular migration diplomacy.

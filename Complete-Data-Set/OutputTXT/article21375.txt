Makale Başlığı: Dictyoconus aydimi (Gallardo-Garcia and Serra-Kiel, 2016) comb. nov., larger benthic foraminifera from the Middle-Upper Eocene of the Middle East (SE Turkey, Iraq, SW Iran, Oman): New evidence for Arabian Plate faunal provincialism
Özet: Rogerella aydimi Gallardo-Garcia and Serra-Kiel was described from the Priabonian Haluf Member of the Aydim Formation, Oman. Based on new finds from the Bartonian Hoya Formation of SE Turkey and the Jahrum Formation of Iran, its taxonomic status is discussed herein. It is concluded that it represents a species of Dictyoconus with a simple subepidermal network (1 rafter, 1 intercalary beam) below a thin epiderm. The stratigraphic range of D. aydimi known thus far is Bartonian-Priabonian or Shallow Benthic Zone 1720. The distribution of D. aydimi gives further evidence for a Middle-Late Eocene faunal provincialism of the Arabian Plate (Somalia, Oman, Iran, Iraq, SE Turkey).

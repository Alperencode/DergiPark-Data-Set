Makale Başlığı: EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES ON THE SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE CYLINDERS CONFINED WITH BFRP SHEETS, THE METHODOLOGY - PART A
Özet: Basalt fiber-reinforced polymers composite laminates have been widely used in recent years to improve and strengthen the flexural capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) elements. Basalt fibers outperform carbon laminates in terms of corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and ductility. However, there is a scarcity of knowledge about the mechanical properties of these laminates. and their hybrid combinations when left in high heating regimes. The effect of higher heating regimes on the compressive strength of 21 unconfined and 21 confined BFRP concrete cylinders is investigated in this research. For 1, 2, and 3 hours, all of the cylinders were heated to 100 and 200 °C. The compressive strengths of unwrapped concrete cylinders were compared to wrapped cylinders' counterparts. The extreme temperatures used in this investigation had essentially no effect on the compressive strength of the wrapped BFRP sheets cylinders; however, the unwrapped specimens were severely affected. As the exposure hours and heating level increased, the compressive strength of the unwrapped specimens dropped. After two hours of exposure to 200°C, the unwrapped specimens lost 31.53% of their compressive strength, whereas the BFRP covered specimens lost 14.47 %.

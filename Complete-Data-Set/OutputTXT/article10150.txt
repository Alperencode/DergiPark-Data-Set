Makale Başlığı: Armenians from Konya and an Outlook on Their Educational Activities
Özet: During the democratization and democratic initiative years of Ottoman Empire, the statesmen accepted andbrought out equal citizenship for Non-Muslims within the Empire. Consequently, minorities in Konya alsoestablished their own educational institutions.In the schools they established, in addition to formal education, they also tried to encourage social activates whichpromote cooperation, friendship and sharing among students. Besides the literature club, the music club, the choirand orchestra club and the theater club, which were brought into the forefront, trainings to satisfy the need forauxiliary staff in the printing house and trainings for afforestation and greening were also given. Furthermore, inorder to teach Christianity to students from different religions, they gave religious lessons by teachers during theweekdays and by priests on Sundays under the name of "Being Devoted to God”. In certain evenings, theycontinued these activities as religious sermons, chants and prayers for all students. It was usually the Armenianschools which did these activities.Armenian schools had also different activities which affected social life in Konya and promoted integration withthe public in Konya. There were concerts and theatre performances which took place at least twice a year and theseactivities were financed by missionaries from the USA and as well as German merchants. Furthermore, theseAmerican missionaries established new schools for Armenians on the grounds of “legal rights given to foreigners”.

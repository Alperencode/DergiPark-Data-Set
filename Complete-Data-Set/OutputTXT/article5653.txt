Makale Başlığı: Bundle Theory, Teletransportation Paradox, and Four-Dimensionalist Approach
Özet: The problem of “identity over time” is one of the most essential problems in thehistory of philosophy. However, the problem of identity arises not only with physicalobjects but also with the identity of consciousness itself. The problem of theidentity of consciousness can be described as the question of whether it is a meredescription or whether it has an ontological status as a being in itself. In this paper, I argue that the prominent theories of consciousness, such as the Bundle Theory, are insufficient for explaining problems,such as the transition of consciousness or split minds, by adapting the solutions of the four-dimensionalist approach to thetransition of identity problems from the point of view of the philosophy of time. For this purpose, I cite examples from wellknownpuzzles of philosophy, namely the Ship of Theseus and Chisholm’s Coffee Cup, and apply the same examples to thetransition of consciousness. Through the analogies of those examples, I argue for the temporal and half-temporal existence ofconsciousness. The main question here is whether there is a temporality of consciousness or an abstract ontological status ofconsciousness. In answering this question, I assume that consciousness, like any other spacetime object, has a mereologicalessence. I refute the Bundle Theory and Parfit’s solution by analogy with Sider’s argument against Perry and Prior. Thus, Ienhance my argument in favor of the analytic metaphysics of identity.

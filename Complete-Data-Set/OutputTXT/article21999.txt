Makale Başlığı: A Compulsory Complementary Health Insurance Model Proposal For The Sustainability of General Health Insurance in Turkey
Özet: After General Health Insurance scheme was put into effect in Turkey in 2008, access to health service providers became easier and service quality increased. As a result, applications to health service providers have increased and in parallel, public health expenditures are increasing every year. Since the health services are free at the moment of provision, the insured may tend to use health services more often than they should. For these reasons, unnecessary and excessive service consumption leads to waste of resources in health financing, raises costs and threatens financial sustainability in the long-run . In this study, the importance and applicability of complementary health insurances in terms of financial sustainability of General Health Insurance in Turkey is accentuated and it is aimed to put forward a compulsory complementary private health insurance scheme that can be applied for employees whose earnings are above a particular level.

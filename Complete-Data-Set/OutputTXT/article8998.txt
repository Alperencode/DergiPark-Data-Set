Makale Başlığı: Distribution of Implant Failure Caused by Positioning in a Group of Turkish Patients on CBCT
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of implant failure rates due to implant positioning on Cone beam Computerized Tomography. Methods: Study sample (n= 333) consisted of CBCT(Cone-beam computerized tomography) scans of patients who were referred to the Department of Dentomaxillofacial Radiology, University of Health Sciences Turkey, Gülhane Faculty of Dentistry, Ankara, Turkey. Obtained data such as age, gender, number of implants and locations from CBCT images gathered and recorded. Results: The data consists of 333 patients and so the total data evaluated was 844. The implant survival rate of the patients between 20-40 years old (49.4%) was lower significantly than that of the patients ≥ 40 years old (P=0.001). In the R4 (right mandibular region), implant failure rate is 17.5% shows quite low rate compared to other regions. At the R1 (right maxillar region) (39%)  and R2 (45%) the most common reason of failure was maxillary sinus perforation, the least common reason was palatinal bone perforation, respectively 4% and 1%. Conclusion: Preventing misinterpretations of clinicians is only possible by correct evaluation of incidental findings and better knowledge of head and neck anatomy.

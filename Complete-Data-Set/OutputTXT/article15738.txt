Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF SLIVER DELIVERY SPEED ON THE UNEVENNES OF CARDED AND COMBED COTTON YARNS
Özet: The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of five different sliver delivery speeds on the yarn unevenness CVm (%). For this purpose, 100% cotton raw material was used, and card sliver samples were produced at five different card sliver delivery speeds (60 m/min, 120 m/min, 180 m/min, 240 m/min and 300 m/min). A total of 600 sample cops were produced in the ring spinning machine, each of which is 10 pieces of knitting and weaving yarn types in the carded and combed machine line, with the yarn counts Ne 20/1, Ne 30/1 and Ne 40/1 from these reed strips produced. The quality characteristics of the raw material used and the produced carded sliver samples were measured using the Uster HVI 1000 and Uster AFIS test equipment. The quality characteristics of the ring yarn cops samples produced on the ring spinning machine were measured with the help of Uster Tester 4 and Uster Tensojet Test devices. The results were analyzed by inferential and descriptive analysis methods. ANOVA analysis method was used for statistical analysis. According to the research findings, in both carded and combed Ne 40/1 yarn samples, an increase in yarn unevenness was observed with the increase in card sliver exit speed, and this increase created a statistically significant difference. The results revealed that the yarn unevenness is directly proportional to the card sliver exit speed and the increase of the card sliver exit speed causes the production of card sliver samples with higher unevenness values (Cvm (%).

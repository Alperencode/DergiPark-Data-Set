Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMPLE OF INDIAN CINEMA IN THE CONTEXT OF V. PROPP'S STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS METHOD: "LAGAAN" (2001)
Özet: This study is about Lagaan, which is one of the top Bollywood film industries of world cinema. The movie has been inspired by the football match between Mohun Bagan and the British in 1911. Besides being one of the best examples reflecting the struggle for independence, it has concerned great attention from the audience as it also has involved the socio-economic and socio-cultural difficulties experienced by the Indian society. It has been determined that this event, inspired by historical reality, has brought some changes to time, place and people by preserving the skeletal structure. In this study, the similarities and differences between the historical event and the new narrative brought to the gray screen has been tried to be explained. This comparison has allowed us to understand the reasons for the current changes. The adapted film, on the other hand, has been tried to be evaluated with a thirty-one-item morphological analysis method which the Russian folklorist Vladimir Yakovlevich Propp, who is known for his valuable contributions to the field of folklore, reveals the structure of the narratives. Based on the analysis of the film with the morphological method, the article draws attention to the fact that cinema culture, especially socialist realistic cinema, often feeds/can be fed by events inspired by historical reality.

Makale Başlığı: Multiple Intelligence’s and Computational Thinking
Özet: Stakeholders from education are determined to introduce computational thinking (CT) and programming much earlier into the educational process. Thus, according to international trends, programming has grown progressively, reaching a significant focus within the EU and other countries. Since future research needs to be undertaken to investigate the interrelationship between CT skills and competencies, we designed a project to be carried out during one year with 9-year-old students attending a primary school of Basic Education. This article presents the results achieved until we had the chance since the COVID pandemic disturbed the investigation's final part.

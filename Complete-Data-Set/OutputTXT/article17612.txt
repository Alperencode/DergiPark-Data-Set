Makale Başlığı: ETHNIC IDENTITY-ETHNIC TENT: IN THE SAMPLE OF TURKISH NOVEL CENTERED ON WAR
Özet: Ethnic identity-ethnic tent is a phenomenon that emerges as a result of the effortsof the individual to introduce themselves as different from the others or the effortsof the dominant ideology to define the individual differently. The answer given bythe person to the question “who am I” does not only manifest by referring to thecountry of citizenship or nationality or the economic class to which he/she is amember but, on the contrary, the individual also tends to some different forms ofself-identification. The roles that the individual has undertaken since childhood andthe traumas experienced due to these roles are the cause of the ethnic tent. Ethnictent; is the shelter of group belonging. In all narratives centered on war, conflictbased on ethnic origin forms the framework of the plot. In this context, 10 worksthat deal with both the operational, intellectual and emotional dimensions of thewar (Hilal Görününce, Aşela, Ağlama Tuna, Emanet Çeyiz Mübadele İnsanları, Bingöl Cepheleri,Soğuk Cennetin Çocukları, Paylaşılmayan Topraklar, Yüzbaşı Selahattin’in Romanı I-II,Günbatımı) has been studied with political-psychological interpretation and withinthe framework of the principles of sociology of literature.

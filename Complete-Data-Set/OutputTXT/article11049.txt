Makale Başlığı: The Role of International News Agencies in  Global Political Crises
Özet: As a focus emerging within the framework of new media, online social networks have taken an active role in the social processes of globalization and have spread communication worldwide. In this regard, it is important to examine the presence of agencies in online social networks as global news providers and to reveal the structural characteristics of online news distribution. This study is about examining the structure of international communication in new media in the context of state and media relations. In the conditions created by the development of the new media, the main preoccupation of the research is to examine the structures of the international news agents, who have had the chance to directly contact the public. The ways of presenting the interventions to the political crisis in Syria on the Twitter accounts of CNN and Sputnik will be examined with the critical discourse analysis method developed by Teun Van Dijk, and the findings will be compared with the intervention arguments developed by the official authorities of the USA and Russia, the countries where the sample news agencies have their headquarters. In this context, it has been determined that the meanings and general discourse in the texts presented by the news agencies are in harmony with the policies of the countries in which they have their headquarters, and that the texts used in the new media are created to protect the state interests structured in economic capital relations.

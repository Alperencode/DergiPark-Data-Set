Özet: The aim of this study is to measure the attitudes and behaviors of individuals living in the urban area of Adana province in order to create data and to contribute in the regulations to be made for the protection of the environment, to establish the relevant policies and to plan the necessary trainings. For this purpose, a face-to-face survey was conducted with individuals living in Adana. It is seen that individuals have knowledge about practices that may cause environmental problems. However, it is seen that their behaviors with respect to the environment are not regular and they act in a particular manner from time to time. It has been determined that they do not prefer to buy packaged products made of recycled materials. It has been determined that there are differences between the environmental attitudes, behaviors and sources of environmental problems according to the gender, age and education variables of the individuals. Considering all these results, in order to hand down a more livable environment for the next generations, education programs at all levels should be emphasized in order to raise awareness of the environment, to encourage governments to produce effective policies in order to raise awareness of individuals about the environment and to make their behaviors towards environmental protection permanent.

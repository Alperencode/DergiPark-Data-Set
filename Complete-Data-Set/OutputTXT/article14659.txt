Makale Başlığı: The Impact of Rural Development Investments Support Programme on Local Development in Konya Province
Özet: In today's world, where negativities such as climate change, drought, global warming and pandemics affect the whole world, and the importance of food, agriculture and rural areas is clearly understood, the existence and dissemination of enterprises for the processing and storage of agricultural products that make significant contributions to local and rural development are extremely important. In the research, it has been tried to reveal their contribution to local and rural development with the evaluations made on 110 small-scale enterprises benefiting from the supports in Konya within the scope of the Rural Development Investments Support Program, which has been implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry since 2006, and the interviews with the representatives of the relevant public and non-governmental organizations. It has been observed that the employment in the enterprises has increased by 71.80%, and the agricultural products that the enterprises have been procuring from the local level at a rate of 70-97%. It has been determined that 75% of the enterprises have increased their income levels at or above the expected level, and production volumes have increased in 63.90%. It has also been observed that the grant support program has significant multiplier effects by activating the relevant sectors locally, increasing the project culture and setting an example for the investments to be made. Necessary privileges should be provided for local actors to play a more active role in the design of the program and for producer organizations with very low levels of benefiting from the program to benefit more from the grant support.

Makale Başlığı: Global commercial aviation policies in the context of the climate crisis and an analysis of these approaches from the perspective of Türkiye
Özet: The climate crisis is becoming more visible day by day and is affecting the ecological system more and more. However, despite such a visible threat and its severe effects, efforts at the national and international levels are far from tackling the climate crisis. Especially with its rapid growth and ever-increasing emission rates, the commercial aviation sector remains inadequate in combating the climate crisis. This study discusses the global and Turkish commercial aviation sectors’ struggles with the climate crisis. As a result, both international and domestic commercial aviation sectors follow an unrealistic attitude in the fight against the climate crisis, and there is still a long way to go.

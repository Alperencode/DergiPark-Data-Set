Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE THEATER BOXES IN THE HOUSING DESIGNS OF LOOS IN TERMS OF VISUAL INTERACTION ABSTRACT
Özet: Adolf Loos, one of the pioneers of modern architecture, has been the subject of many discussionswithin the scope of visual interaction thanks to the theater boxes used in the spatial setup of the residenceshe designed. Accordingly, it is important to reveal the see-and-be seen relation that Loos created in spacewith the fiction of the theatre boxes, which leads the scope of the study to be covered by the Houses ofMoller, Josephine Baker and Müller, as key examples of Loos’ theatre boxes fiction. In line with this purpose,the see-and-be seen relation of selected residential buildings was examined using visibility graph analysisand peer field of view analysis, which are methods of space sequencing. Since the peer field of view analysesare performed with the users’ perspectives, the study focused on understanding perceptions and movementsof users in space. Correspondingly, visual interaction data of selected locations was obtained through theanalysis method used. With the acquired data, interaction of seeing and being seen and its patterns aredetermined as the focal point of the study.

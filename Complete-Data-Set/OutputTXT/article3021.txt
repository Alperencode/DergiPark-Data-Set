Makale Başlığı: The Development of Broadband Microstrip Patch Antenna for Wireless Applications
Özet: The small volume of microstrip antennas has low production costs and easy production, which has accelerated the work in this area. The disadvantages are narrow bandwidth and low gain. In wireless communication, antennas with low return loss and high bandwidth are required. The bandwidth and power gain of the microstrip patch antennas should be increased optimally. This article presents the design of the broadband microstrip patch antenna operating in the ISM 2.4 GHz band (2400-2485 MHz). The study includes three-dimensional antenna model, simulation phase and fabrication / measurement phase. For the low cost of the antenna, FR-4 with the relative dielectric constant 4.3 and the loss tangent tan 0.02 is preferred as the substrate material. Dielectric material thickness is determined as 1.6 mm. The length of the feed line and the dimensions of the rectangular patch were found by mathematical calculations with the transmission line model. There are slots on the antenna, which is a very simple method in order to improve the bandwidth, gain and directivity parameters of the antenna. In the article, four different designs are presented, the results are compared and the proposed antenna has 979 MHz bandwidth and 2.68 dBi directivity gain at -10 dB at the resonance frequency of 2.316 GHz. The changes made in the antenna design have improved the results such as gain and bandwidth compared to the conventional microstrip patch antenna. The proposed antenna is suitable for use in mobile communication.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Psychological Dependence on Smoking Urge and Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms
Özet: Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of psychological dependence on nicotine on smoking desire and nicotine withdrawal symptoms.Materials and Methods: This cross - sectional study was performed between April 2018 and August 2018 at the Chest Diseases Clinic Smoking Cessation Polyclinic. Sociodemographic data form, Assessment of Psychological Dependence of Smoking Test (APDST) and Fagerström Nicotine Dependence Test (FNBT) were administered to nicotine addicts who agreed to participate in the study. Carbon monoxide was measured in the expiratory air and the nicotine withdrawal symptoms during smoking cessation were questioned. On the day of admission, after three hours of nicotine withdrawal, the Smoking Urge Scale (SUS) was administered.Results: Of the 130 patients included in the study, 48 were female (37.69%) and 82 were male (63.07%). The mean age of all cases was 38.91 ± 11.30 years and the age distribution of the first experience of smoking was similar (p = 0.405). The two most common symptoms of nicotine withdrawal were excessive smoking desire with 66.15% and irritability & anger with 58.46%. A positive, moderate linear relationship was found between APDST and SUS (r = 0.545, p <0.001). There was a moderate correlation between excessive smoking desire, one of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and SUS (r = 0.466, p <0.001).Conclusion: Although damages due to smoking are known, quitting smoking is a very difficult process. With the use of APDST and SUS in smoking cessation clinics, patients with a high desire for smoking can be identified at an early stage, and additional pharmacological and behavioral treatment methods can be selected to increase the success of treatment.

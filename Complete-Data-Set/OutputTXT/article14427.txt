Makale Başlığı: A Feminist Analysis on Anti-System Movies: The Case of “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest”
Özet: The years between the 1960s and the 1970s is the era that anti-system social movements have risen. It is possible to catch the rebellions and the demands of the age from cultural products. In this context, having a critical view over the system, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” is a USA origin movie adapted from Ken Kesey's novel published in 1962. The movie has become one of the most highly rated movies during the age. However, the critical base of the film does not touch the patriarchal system. Thus, the “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” movie is aimed to examine from the feminist point of view to be able to unearth the probable feeding paths of the patriarchal system by gender-blind system criticism. The movie bears doubts about the mental institution, which focuses on whether the hospital straightforwardly fulfills its institutional functions. These doubts can be put forth as the basis for anti-system regard. In this study, it is dwelt on the working mechanism of the institution initially. Subsequently, the conflicts between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy and other characters are discussed under gender-based focus.

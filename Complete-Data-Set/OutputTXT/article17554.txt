Makale Başlığı: FUNCTION OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PROHIBITION REGIME
Özet: The function and purpose of political party prohibition regime is to make the pluralist democratic order sustainable and functional and to ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms are guaranteed in this order. Political party prohibitions can be seen as legitimate and functional to the extent that they fulfill this purpose and function. Otherwise, disproportionate and illegitimate interventions against the freedom of forming political parties will transform the pluralistic democratic order into an authoritarian order, and it will not be possible to protect fundamental rights and freedoms in such an order. Thus, to the extent that the political party prohibition regime can achieve this delicate balance, it will serve a pluralist democracy based on rights and freedoms.

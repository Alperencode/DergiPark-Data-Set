Makale Başlığı: Public Security Measures That Were Taken on Ottoman Railways
Özet: In the second half of the XIXth century, the railways that made their way into the Ottoman Empire brought many innovations and conveniences to the economic and social life and had an impact on the country's security. In order to maintain order and safety, the Ottoman Empire took some safety measures at the lines, trains and stations that make up the railway system. This study covers the second half of the XIXth century and the beginning of the XXth century, and the Ottoman Archives of the Directorate of State Archives were used as well as second-hand sources. The study focuses on the public safety measures taken on the railway system. The results of the study reveal that in order to ensure public order at these locations, specific legislation entered into the force, and in accordance with the provisions of said legislation, railway lines, stations and trains have taken the necessary precautions against both terrorism and ordinary crime, and the police, gendarmerie, military police forces and military units served on such duties. In addition, despite all the measures taken, railway lines and trains were subjected to a number of terrorist attacks, especially in the Balkans and the Hejaz region, and ordinary crimes were committed in all areas that make up the railway system.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Used Different Waste Growing  Media on Soilless Lettuce Cultivation
Özet: This study investigated the effects of reusing the growing media (TSW; tomato stalk waste, PTSW; pretreated tomato stalk waste, Peat + Perlite, Cocopeat) used in soilless agriculture on soilless lettuce cultivation. Significant effects of growing media on stem diameter, root length,	total dry weight, yield, titratable acidity, SSC and Vitamin C values of lettuce (Maritima) grown without soil were determined (p<0.05; p<0.01). As a result of the highest root length (33.63 cm), total dry weight (27.22 g) and yield (558 g plant-1) were obtained from TSW medium. The highest titratable acidity values (1.05 g 100 mL-1) and  Vitamin C (391.6 mg 100 g-1) were obtained from PTSW medium. It has been determined that TSW and PTSW media can compete with commercial growing media, especially in terms of yield and quality. The second use of the growing medium created from tomato waste significantly reduced the production costs. As a result, it has been determined that tomato waste (TSW) is a good alternative in terms of productivity and profitability instead of commercial growing medium.

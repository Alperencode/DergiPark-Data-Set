Makale Başlığı: Social Media and Post Truth: An Evaluation On Covid- 19
Özet: Post Truth, which is a concept in which beliefs and feelings come to the fore more than the truth, came to the fore with the increase in the use of mass media, especially social media. It is seen that the Post-Truth era, which refers to a period in which the boundaries between truth and lies are blurred, has been effective in guiding the masses by preventing the masses from accessing the right information, and social media plays an important role at this point. With the development of new media and the spread of fake news more rapidly, the post-truth period has entered, when the truth is devalued. In the study, by focusing on the concept of Post-Truth, the relationship between social media and the concept of Post-Truth is theoretically discussed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

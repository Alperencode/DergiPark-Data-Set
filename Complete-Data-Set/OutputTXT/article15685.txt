Makale Başlığı: US AND OTHERS IN INTERNET DICTIONARIES: A RESEARCH ON TITLE AS SYRIAN ASYLUM SEEKERS IN EKSI SOZLUK
Özet: In March 2011, the social movements that developed under the influence of the Arab Spring uprisings gradually grew in Syria and turned into a civil war. Many countries and citizens of those countries, especially Syria, which carries risky and difficult to live conditions, have been under the influence of the war. Turkey, which is one of the countries neighboring Syria, has been one of the countries most affected by the war by accepting many Syrian refugees and asylum seekers with its open door policy. In this context, questions such as whether there is a marginalizing perception and discourse practice towards Syrian asylum seekers in Turkey, which hosts Syrians, come to the fore. The study basically sought an answer to this question and aimed to investigate the perception of Syrian asylum seekers in internet dictionaries, which is a popular internet medium in Turkey. For this purpose, the entries entered under the title of Syrian asylum seekers in Ekşi Sözlük were selected as a sample. In the study, the attitudes and prejudices of the dictionary entry writers towards asylum seekers were analyzed within the framework of the ideological background that formed the discourse by categorizing them under certain headings, with T. Van Dijk's critical discourse analysis method.

Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION ON BIST MANUFACTURING FIRMS
Özet: Inappropriate capital structure is considered as one of the reasons why firms experience financial distress. However, literature reveals conflicting empirical results about the relationship between capital structure and financial distress. Therefore, this study aims to contribute reducing the uncertainty in the literature by investigating the relationship between capital structure decisions and financial distress through BIST manufacturing sector firms. For this purpose, the data of 152 companies listed in the BIST manufacturing sector for the period of 2015-2020 were analyzed using multiple regression method. In the study, the financial distress is represented by the Altman Z-Score and Springate S-Score variables while the capital structure decisions are represented by leverage and maturity structure of external debt. According to the findings, the capital structure decisions influence the degree of financial distress. Accordingly, as the ratio of total debts, short-term debts and long-term debts in the capital structure of firms increases, the level of financial distress also increases. In addition, the level of financial distress decreased as profitability and firm age increased, while the level of financial distress increased as firm size increased. In this context, it can be stated that firms can avoid financial distress with the financial decisions they will take and the optimal strategies they will implement.

Makale Başlığı: DESIGN FOR EMOTIONAL DURABILITY: THE CASE OF HOUSEHOLD LIGHT DESIGN
Özet: Designers’ hands-on experience in research through design process contributes them to produceand share knowledge from their own design practices. In this study, the primary purpose was exploringsustainable design concepts and developing solutions for improving the product lifespan of household lightwith research through design process. With a particular focus on “emotionally durable design”, “productpersonalisation”, and “localisation” were considered fruitful concepts. The do-it-yourself (DIY) approach,which means that users participate in production, and the halfway product rationale, which leaves space forusers to complete the production, were the concepts used in personalisation. The outcome of the researchthrough design process was a wall lamp manufactured with different scales of production, involvingpersonalisation features facilitated by DIY and halfway product rationale. For “localisation”, different scales ofproduction opportunities were explored, and a design kit as a halfway product was considered as a sustainabledesign solution. DIY approach was benefited for producing complementary lace lampshade. In the designfor sustainability framework, it is seen that experimenting and engaging with locally available materials andmanufacturing capabilities in the research through design process nurtured developing sustainable designsolutions.

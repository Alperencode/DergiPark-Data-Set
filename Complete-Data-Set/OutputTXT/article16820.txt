Makale Başlığı: Revisiting the Environmental Security in Terms of Evolution Process
Özet: Environmental problems have been a growing human-induced challenge that intensively affect our life and our future. Therefore, this paper aims at analyzing the evolution of environmental security. Although environmental concern had emerged earlier in the 1960s, the setting relations between environmental decline and security started in the 1980s. Environmental decline like transboundary pollution and resource scarcity have been deemed to have undesirable impact on the security of states, communities and individuals. Environmental security suggests that environmental problems, notably resource scarcity and environmental decline can cause violent/conflict among states and communities.

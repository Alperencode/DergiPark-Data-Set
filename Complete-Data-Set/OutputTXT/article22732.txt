Makale Başlığı: On Turkish Words about Dairy Products (Günay Karaağaç)
Özet: In places and times when people's lifestyles depend on geographical conditions rather than their own actions, every circle of latitude, every sea, lake or river shore, in short, every surface shape naturally presented its own conditions to the people living on it, allowing them to live in these conditions, forced them to show the necessary behaviors to live in these conditions and to emigrate those who did not show these behaviors. In ancient times, when the way of life was largely dependent on geography, people took on the color of the geography they lived in in all areas of their culture, from their diet and clothing to their beliefs.

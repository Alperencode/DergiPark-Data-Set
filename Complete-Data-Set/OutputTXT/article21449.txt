Makale Başlığı: Oscillatory and asymptotic behavior of third-order nonlinear differential equations with a superlinear neutral term
Özet: Sufficient conditions are derived for all solutions of a class of third-order nonlinear differential equations with a superlinear neutral term to be either oscillatory or convergent to zero asymptotically. Examples illustrating the results are included and some suggestions for further research are indicated.

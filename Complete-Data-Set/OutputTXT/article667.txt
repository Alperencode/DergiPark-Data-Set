Makale Başlığı: Production of Iced Tea from Poppy Flowers Extract
Özet: Iced teas, which are among the drinks that are frequently consumed today, are mostly produced from black tea and the production of iced teas of different plant origins is very limited. Poppy plant (Papaver rhoaes L.) is an annual edible flower species belonging to the family Papaveraceae, and it has been stated in various studies that the anthocyanins it contains have bioactive properties such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antiproliferative. In this study, poppy flower anthocyanins were obtained by acidic ethanol-water extraction method and the extract was dried with maltodextrin in a spray dryer. Eight different poppy iced teas were produced by combining dried poppy extract with sucrose and citric acid at different rates in the iced tea formulation. Total anthocyanin and total phenolic content of iced teas were determined as 10.98-28.49 mg cyn-3-O-glu/100 mL and 9.15-21.96 mg GAE/100 mL, respectively. It was determined that the pasteurization process applied during the production of iced teas caused significant increases in the antioxidant activity values of the products (p<0.05). After the sensory evaluations of the products, it was determined that the G6 coded iced tea was the most liked sample by the panellists. This is thought to be due to the fact that the anthocyanin, colour density and sucrose values of the G6 coded sample containing 0.40 g of dried poppy extract, 10 g of sucrose and 0.25 g of citric acid. are higher than the others. It was concluded that iced teas containing poppy flower extract, which were evaluated as high sensory liking, could be an alternative to a limited variety of iced teas.

Makale Başlığı: An Anomaly of Pecten in Mesobuthus turcicus Kovařík et al., 2022 (Scorpiones: Buthidae)
Özet: An anomaly was recorded in the pecten shape of the scorpion species Mesobuthus turcicus Kovařík et al., 2022 that was recently described from Tükiye. In this case, it is observed that marginal and median lamellae and fulcrae are fused in the right pecten. For this reason, the pecten is bent counter clockwise. Different from other pectinal anomalies, the size of teeth is developed normally but teeth number is fewer. This teratological anomaly on pecten is described and illustrated. This is the first report of pecten anomaly based on marginal and median lamellae.

Makale Başlığı: Modeling Internal Factors Affecting Return with the Panel Quantile Regression Approach: The Case of BIST 100
Özet: Financial indicators are ratios that summarize corporate performance, enable comparison of companies in the same sector, and reveal the general trend of corporate performance. Financial ratios are also indicators that provide information about firm profitability, liquidity status, capital structure and financial structure. It is also one of the basic criteria in stock selection. The purpose of this study is to determine the financial ratios associated with stock returns and contribute to the selection of stocks with high returns. In this context, the relationship between the returns of stocks traded in the BIST100 index and financial ratios was analyzed by panel quantile regression analysis. As a result of the study, leverage, stock turnover, return on assets, return on equity, acid-test, current ratio and asset turnover ratios are effective on share returns with a significance level of 5%. These effects were negative on leverage, liquidity, ROA, ITR (at 0.75 quantile) and current asset turnover rate. The positive and significant effect is seen in the current ratio, ROE, ATR and ITR (at 0.25 quantile) rates.

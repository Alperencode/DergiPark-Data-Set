Makale Başlığı: LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE AND ABUSIVE SUPERVISION AS PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING
Özet: This study investigated leader-member exchange (LMX) and abusive supervision (AbS) as predictors of psychological well-being (PWB) among bankers. Participants were 299 bank employees consisting of hundred and thirty (130) males (40.5%) and one hundred and sixty-nine (169) female (59.5%). Their ages ranged from 26-54years with a mean age of 40.5 and a standard deviation of 8.51. The study adopted correlation design and multiple regression statistics to analyze the data from structured questionnaires administered to 320 bankers selected from randomly selected banks in Awka South Local Government Area. Psychological well-being scale, Leader-member exchange scale, and Abusive supervision scale were used as instruments for data collection. Three hypotheses were tested anchored on psychodynamic theory to explain the relationship among variables under study. The results revealed that the first hypothesis confirmed LMX significantly predicted PWB at R2 = .156 (15.6%), F (16.41) = .001 p<.05. The second hypothesis confirmed that AbS which significantly predicted PWB at R2 = .156 (15.6%), F (16.41) = .001 p<.05. The third hypothesis revealed that LMX and AbS jointly predicted PWB. The study recommends that both private sector and public sector organizations should take proactive organizational measures to reduce the abusive supervision and embark on sensitization workshops to enlighten management on the dangers of the menace.

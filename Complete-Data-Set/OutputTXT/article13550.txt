Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Approaches of Health Workers Who are Vulnerable to Stigma Towards COVID-19 Patients
Özet: Aim: It was aimed to evaluate the stigmatization experiences and approaches of healthcare professionals who are vulnerable to stigma towards COVID (+) cases.Method: 151 health workers were included in the study by online survey method. In the analysis made with the G*POWER 3.1.9.7 program, the effect size was 0.569, and when the alpha was 0.05, the sample size was 151 and the power was 0.99. The data were collected with the “Descriptive Information Form”, “Approaches to Individuals Diagnosed with COVID-19 Questionnaire”; expressed as numbers and percentages. Chi-square independence test was used to determine significant relationships.Results: The mean age of the participants was 30.89±8.39 years, 68.2% were women and 59.6% were nurses. Although 66.9% think that they are stigmatized, 22.5% of them are stigmatized because they are health workers; Those stigmatized in common areas known to work with COVID (+) patients are 47.7%. There was no significant difference between stigmatization and hiding the disease, since it works with a COVID (+) patient. Those who think that they are excluded because they are health workers; reported that individuals with COVID-19 are ignorant and negligent.Conclusion: Stigma experiences increased negative feelings and thoughts towards people with COVID (+), but did not prevent professional continuation of treatment processes. Those who think that they are excluded but not stigmatized just because they are health workers suggest internalized stigma and detailed studies are needed.

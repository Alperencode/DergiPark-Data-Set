Material and Method: Survey data obtained from 400 dairy cattle enterprises in the central county of Ağrı province constituted the material of the study. Results: It was determined that in 25.2% of the surveyed enterprises udder cleaning is not performed, and in 93.5% of them the milking is done by hand. The average milk yield of 85.0% of dairy cattle enterprises was between 6-10 liters per animal and only 17.5% of the produced milk was sold. A significant proportion of this milk (95.7%) was marketed as raw milk, and milk in 4.3% of the enterprises was sold after processing into different products such as cheese, yogurt and butter. It was also found out that milk produced in 1.8% of the dairy cattle farms was stored in the cooling tank after milking. 13.6% of the farm owners fed their animals after milking, while 86.3% of them fed them prior to milking. It was also revealed that the calving occurs usually in the winter season and the lactation period of the cows varies between 5-6 months in 57.5% of the enterprises.Conclusion: In order to produce high quality and clean milk in the dairy cattle farms in the central county of Ağrı province, udder cleaning has to be performed properly as well as machine milking should be made widespread. It is necessary to increase the genetic capacity of cows and improve the milking practices of the dairy farms located in the central county of Ağrı province.

Makale Başlığı: Usage of bio-based materials in indoor members
Özet: In this paper, it was aimed to bring alternative suggestions to the usage areas of bio-based materials used in interior reinforcement elements and to contribute to the awareness of these materials. In this regard, the design and production stages of bio-based materials used in interior members were examined in detail and explained with examples. In the study, bio-based materials produced from agricultural wastes, marine wastes, and living organisms, indoor equipment; their use as furniture, flooring, and surface coating material was discussed. Within the scope of the study, relevant articles, theses, books and online resources in the literature were used. As a result, it was understood that bio-based materials produced from agricultural and marine natural wastes and living organisms are suitable for indoor use. It was observed that bio-based materials are accessible, applicable and have aesthetic value, and will reduce the energy consumed and the need for raw materials in the production process. It was understood that studies on bio-based materials are mostly concentrated in the category of design researches, therefore, they do not create essential changes in existing production technologies.

Özet: In this study, a scale was developed in order to determine the levels of life skills supporting learning of university students. The study group consisted of 378 students from different faculties of Pamukkale and Muğla Sıtkı Koçman Universities. In the process of developing the scale, a literature review was conducted, a pool of items was constructed, expert opinions were sought, preliminary studies were carried out, first application, second application, validity and reliability analyses were carried out. As a result of the item analyses performed by using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, a total of 23 items remained in the scale. As a result of exploratory factor analysis, it was observed that the scale had one-dimensional structure related to life skills supporting learning. The scale items gathered under a single factor explained 43.94% of the total variance. As a result of the confirmatory factor analysis, item-factor loading values of the scale items were found to be ranging between .50 and .67. It was found that the differences between the means of the upper and lower 27% groups were significant. The Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale was found to be a=.94. It was concluded that these findings show that the scale is valid and reliable.

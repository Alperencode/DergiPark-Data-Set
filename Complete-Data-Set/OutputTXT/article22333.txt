Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the possibilities of using isabella grape (Vitis labrusca L.) fruit and its extracts in ice cream production
Özet: Isabella grape (Vitis labrusca L.), which grows naturally in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, is traditionally used in the production of pekmez, pestil, and pepeçura which is local dessert called. In our study, ice creams were produced by using the puree of Isabella grape fruit, which is a very rich source in terms of functional properties, and the extracts are prepared with two different solvents and extraction methods at a rate of 5% in the formulation. Changes in some physicochemical properties, color intensity values and sensory properties of the ice creams produced with storage (6 months) were determined. In ice cream samples, the sample type was statistically very significant (p<0.01) on dry matter, ash, protein, pH, titration acidity, volume increase, first dripping time and complete melting time, while dry matter, ash, pH, and titration acidity of the storage period were very significant. It has been shown that the effect of storage time on protein amounts is statistically significant (p<0.05). It was determined that there was an increase in the dry matter, ash and titration acidity values of the ice cream samples at the end of storage. It was determined that the sample type and storage time had a statistically significant (p<0.01) effect on L*, a*, b*, C* and H° values in ice cream samples. Among the ice cream samples, the highest (333.49) H° angle, the closest to the red color of the UUA (ice cream with fragrant grape extract added, prepared with ethanol:pure water (1:1) solvent acidified with 5% acetic acid by ultrasonic extraction method) was found to be. It was determined that the L* and b* values of the ice cream samples increased at the end of storage, and there was a decrease in the a*, C* and H° values. In the sensory evaluation, it was determined that the sample type had a statistically significant (p<0.01) effect on the gum structure, texture, flavor, resistance to melting and fruit ratio scores.

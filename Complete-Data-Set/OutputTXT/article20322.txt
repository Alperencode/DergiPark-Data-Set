Makale Başlığı: The Effectiveness of Mathematical Instruction Presented by Strategic Integration According to Direct Instruction Model on The Levels of Knowledge of Students with Low Vision
Özet: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of strategic integration according to Direct Instruction Model on the skills of students with low vision in mathematics like rhythmic counting backwards in three, line concept, simple fraction and multiplying two-digit numbers without carry overs. The participants are three students with low vision passing the third grade of elementary school. The research model was multiple probe across design in single subject. The mathematical skills in this study include four different association types: verbal association, concepts, correlated features sequence and cognitive strategy. Effectiveness, reliability and social validity were collected during the data collection process. Monitoring data was obtained on the seventh, fourteenth and twenty-first days and generalization data was obtained whether the participants generalize their skills to various materials/situation and different people. Fluency data were collected for rhythmic counting. Social validity data were collected. As a result, it was concluded that the instructions provided through strategic integration according to Direct Instruction Model were effective on the skills of rhythmic counting backwards in three, line concept, simple fraction and multiplication with two-digit numbers. After the instruction, students could generalize these skills. Also, social validity results had positive outcomes.

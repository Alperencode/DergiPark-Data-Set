Makale Başlığı: A Study on Writing Anxiety of Fourth-Grade Primary School Students
Özet: Writing skill requires the use of physical and cognitive skills together in a complex and intensive way. Students consider the writing not as a habit, but as a compulsory assignment. The problems and obstacles encountered in the writing process cause students to experience writing anxiety. The aim of this study is to examine the writing anxiety of fourth-grade students and to determine their differences according to certain variables. Survey design was used in the research. 365 primary school students selected by convenient sampling method. Writing Anxiety Scale and Demographic Information Form were used to collect data. Jamovi 1.6.23 package software was used in the analysis of the data. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the writing anxiety levels of the students and; t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the differences in writing anxiety according to demographic variables. It was found that writing anxiety was at a moderate level in primary school students and did not depend on gender and age, but there was a difference in the writing anxiety of the students according to the education level of their parents, income level and daily reading habits. It was concluded that the writing anxiety of the fourth-grade students was not high and reading habit was effective in eliminating their writing anxiety. It is recommended to give students writing exercises on the subjects they want, to encourage them to write, and to draw attention to the importance of reading in order to write well.

Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF SPORTS ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PERSONS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES
Özet: Purpose: Sport is an important tool in improving the quality of life of individuals with disabilities. The study aim to examine the life quality of individuals with physical disabilities with different functionality levels in relation to sports.Methods: A total of 36 individuals with physical disabilities participated in the study. The participants included individuals without any regular exercise (non-sportive, NS), those who played Boccia (B), and persons who played Wheelchair basketball (WCB) who could not provide independent ambulation. The Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), Functional Independency Measurement (FIM), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), and World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument for People with Intellectual and Physical Disabilities (WHOQOL-DIS) were used for evaluating motor impairment of the trunk, functionality levels, mobility, and quality of life (QoL), respectively.Results: Group B had lower RMI scores compared to group NS (p<0.05). FIM-motor and FIM-total scores were the lowest in group B (p<0.05), whereas FIM-cognitive scores were similar across all groups (p>0.05). However, TIS-total scores were the lowest in the B group (p<0.05) and TIScoordination scores were higher in the WCB group (p<0.05). There was no difference between the groups in TIS static and dynamic evaluations (p>0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of the WHOQOL subscales and the disability module subdimensions (p>0.05). QoL-total score was similar for group B and NS (p>0.05), but higher in the WCB group (p<0.05).Conclusions: It is thought that the low functional B players' having similar quality of life with the other participants is due to the psychological and social effects of B rather than its physical effects.

Makale Başlığı: Evolution of European Union diplomacy in the light of institutional components
Özet: Some of the prominent innovations brought to the European Union by the Lisbon Treaty are related to external actions. Institutions such as The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European  External  Actions  Service  are  seen  as  originalities  of  European  Union  diplomacy.  However,  these institutions  emerged  as  a  result  of  a  long-term  diplomatic development  process.  In  the  study,  this  development process is discussed in two periods on the basis of the diplomatic entity and diplomatic personality born with the Lisbon  Treaty.  Since  institutional  components,  as  one  of  the  main  features  of  the  EU  diplomatic  system,  are important  in  terms  of  their  effects  on  historical  development,  Coreper  and  European  Commission/Union Delegations are examined as examples ofboth the oldest and internal-external diplomatic system components. In the  study, which was prepared in the  light of the relevant literature  and EU  official decisions and reports, it is concluded  that  institutional  innovations  such  as  the  High  Representative  and  the  European  External  Actions Service  have  emerged  as  a  result  of  a  long  historical  struggle  by  the  institutional  structures  operating  in  the internal and external dimensions.

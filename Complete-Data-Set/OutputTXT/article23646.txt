Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Patients Followed Up with the Diagnosis of COVID-19 Caused by the  B.1.1.7 SARS CoV-2 Variant
Özet: Aim: During the replication of SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of COVID-19, numerous variants emerge. The B.1.1.7 (England) variant, which appeared in England in September of the year 2000, is one of them. In this study, we aimed to review the data of patients followed up with a diagnosis of COVID-19 due to the B.1.1.7 variant.Matherial and Methods: This study is a retrospective study containing the data of a total of 50 patients followed up with the diagnosis of COVID-19 caused by the B.1.1.7 variant. Patients were examined in terms of age, gender, underlying disease, symptoms and laboratory findings.Results: Twenty (40%) of the 50 patients included in the study were female and the mean age was 59,4±16,3 years. Leukocytosis in 11 (22%) patients, leukopenia in 4 (8%) patients, lymphopenia in 24 (48%) patients, C-reactive protein increase in 42 (84%) patients, increased ferritin in 28 (56%) patients, and 32 (64%) patients lactate dehydrogenase elevation and d-dimer elevation were found in 16 (32%) patients. Forty-five (90%) patients had involvement in thorax computed tomography. When group 1 (n=36) and group 2 (n=14) were compared, there was a statistically significant difference between the leukocyte, d-dimer and procalcitonin levels between the two groups.  (p˂0,000,p=0,001,p=0,001, respectively).Conclusion: In conclusion, in this study, in which we examined patients with the B.1.1.7 variant, leukocyte, procalcitonin and d-dimer values were statistically significantly higher in patients who died than in patients who survived. The data we obtained from these patients were similar to the literature data of the patients without variants.

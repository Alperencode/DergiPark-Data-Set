Makale Başlığı: Carbon Footprint Calculation of Different Building Typologies under Construction and Operation Stages
Özet: In line with the calculation of carbon footprint (CF), the direct and indirect sources of emissions arising from two different building typologies in Turkey, a hospital and a complex building covering shopping mall, offices and residences were determined representing the construction stage, and another hospital and a shopping mall were selected as examples of operation stage to cover the entire sector. The scope was determined according to classifications specified in ISO 14064 Greenhouse Gas Calculation and Verification Management System. The calculations were done by multiplying the emission factors obtained from international sources with the actual consumption values gathered from a Contractor Company established in Turkey. As studies on national emission factors have not yet been completed, internationally accepted and recognized values were used. In the light of determined emission sources and scopes, the CF of the hospitals and complex building projects for at least 2 years were calculated and the changes were evaluated. The findings obtained within the scope of the projects built and/or operated representing different building typologies in the construction sector indicated that electricity consumption had the largest share regarding the CF calculations. In addition, worldwide examples on mitigation applications were referred and underlined in the study.

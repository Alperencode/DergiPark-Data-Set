Makale Başlığı: The Role of Nomophobia in the Relationship of Smartphone Addiction and Life Satisfaction: Application of the Structural Equality Model
Özet: Due to the features constantly added to smartphones, individuals can finish most of their daily work on their phones, which has motivated individuals to use more smartphones. However, this situation has increased the problematic smartphone use of individuals and has turned into a problem that is described as smartphone addiction and is among the behavioral addictions. Similarly, individuals who devote a certain part of their daily life to their smartphones have encountered the problem of nomophobia, which is described as the fear of being separated from their smartphones. Both situations ultimately affected the mental health of individuals and their life satisfaction, which explains the quality of their social relations. The aim of the study is to examine the relationships between students' smartphone addiction, nomophobia levels and life satisfaction. Four hundred thirty unit samples from Osmaniye Korkut Ata University students were used in the study. As a result of the structural equation model analysis based on the literature review on variables, a significant positive relationship was found between smartphone addiction and nomophobia. On the other hand, a significant negative correlation was found between nomophobia and life satisfaction and between smartphone addiction and life satisfaction. In addition, it was seen that nomophobia had a partial mediating role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and life satisfaction.

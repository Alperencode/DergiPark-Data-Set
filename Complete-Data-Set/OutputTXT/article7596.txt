Makale Başlığı: Intuitive Eating and The Relationship Between Intuitive Eating and Health
Özet: Intuitive eating is a health approach which promotes a positive attitude towards the body, food, food related behaviors and physical activity. It is characterized by eating based on physiological hunger and satiety cues rather than situational and emotional cues and is associated with psychological well-being. Several studies have shown the importance of intuitive eating for improved health, including lower chances of being overweight, lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and blood pressure, lower chances of binge eating, emotional eating, external eating and eating disorder symptoms, lowered concerns with body image and better diet quality. Intuitive eating has been proposed as a more natural and effective alternative to weight management methods. The aim of this review is to investigate the intuitive eating and the relationship between intuitive eating and health.

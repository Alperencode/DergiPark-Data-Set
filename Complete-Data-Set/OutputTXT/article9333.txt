Makale Başlığı: Plate osteosynthesis for proximal humerus fractures through a deltoid-split approach under traction in lateral decubitus position: preliminary results
Özet: Aim: We aimed to present deltoid split approach under traction in lateral decubitus position that we perform for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) and to present the preliminary surgical and clinical outcomes of our patients.Material and Method: Twelve patients who underwent plate osteosynthesis through a deltoid split approach under traction in lateral decubitus position between May 2019 and January 2021 were evaluated. Patient demographics, Neer classification, and time from injury to surgery were collected in all patients preoperatively. Radiation exposure time and operating time was recorded intraoperatively. Radiological outcomes were assessed, including time to union, and neck-shaft angle. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Constant score at the minimum 12-month follow-up.Results: Twelve patients (5 male, 7 female) were evaluated with a mean age 58.6±10.7 years (range, 32 to 72 years) at the time of surgery. The mean follow-up period was 117.4±3.8 months). The mean operation time was 60.7±15.2 min (range, 44 to 92 min). The mean radiation exposure time was 6.1±3.0 s (range, 3.3 to 14.2 s). Fracture union was observed in all patients at mean 14.6±2.5 weeks (range, 8 to 20 weeks). The mean neck-shaft angle after the union was 134.5±3.4 degrees (range, 124 to 143 degrees). The mean Constant score was at the final follow-up was 76.4±8.7 (range, 63 to 90).Conclusion: Patient positioning in the lateral decubitus position under traction can be considered as a safe, reliable, and reproducible method in selected patients with PHFs.

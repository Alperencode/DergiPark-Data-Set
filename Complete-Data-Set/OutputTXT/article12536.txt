Makale Başlığı: Teachers' Expectations from Islamic Religion Lesson in Schools in Germany: Example of Baden-Württemberg
Özet: This study was conducted in public schools 1-4 in the 2018/2019 academic year of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. The aim of this study was to determine the opinions and expectations of the teachers of the Islamic religion lesson about the operation and implementation of the sect-based Islamic religion lesson, which was implemented as a pilot project at the grade level, and to obtain information about the current status of the lesson. Since the sect-based Islamic religion lesson is still in the process of formation in Germany, the information on the application and course of the course is important in terms of guiding the studies at the point of development of the course. Qualitative research method was used in the research. Research data were collected by semi-structured interview technique consisting of open-ended questions. The research sample consists of 11 Islamic religion lesson teachers. In the research, teachers' opinions and expectations were expressed with the help of analysis categories. Thus, evaluations were made about at which points the Islamic religion course is suitable for expectations and at which points it should be made appropriate.

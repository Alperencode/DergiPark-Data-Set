Makale Başlığı: Game Theory Approach For Supplier Evaluatıon: Buyer-Supplier Game
Özet: It is seen that businesses that can continue their activities today plan and manage their supply chains effectively. The most important factor enabling the emergence of the supply chain is the use of resources. The most important resource use decision is supplier selection. In this study, it is aimed to assesment the suppliers according to competitive priorities with the game theory approach as an alternative to the multi-criteria decision making techniques used in supplier selection problems in the literature. It is thought that the game theory approach, which includes an interactive decision mechanism based on the opinions of all parties, rather than the techniques that are frequently used in supplier selection problems and based on one-sided expert opinion, will yield more rational results in supplier selection problems. In addition, one-on-one interviews were made with the players on the field, and a real environment was transferred to the fictional structure of game theory. In this way, the work has become even more important. As a result, in this study, it was aimed to make supplier evaluation with the game theory approach and buyer-supplier games were constructed with the thought that the results would be more rational. The situations in which the strategies of the players, which are created by taking into account their ability to use competitive priorities, differ according to the opponent's strategy are explained.

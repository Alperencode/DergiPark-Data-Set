Makale Başlığı: Space And Two Women: A Narratıve on Flexıbılıty and ‘Subcontractıng of Assurance’
Özet: Neoliberalism, which has made the concepts of flexibilization and precarisation one of the most dominant discussion areas of the literature, also contains the potential to socialize the market mind. It is necessary to keep in mind the fact that the production relations contribute to the production of ideology as a part of the social structure, and at this point, one should not also be gender-blind. The reflection of the collaboration of malestreaming with capitalism on space is directly decisive on female labour. Therefore, the social aspect of the space, in other words the productive nature of the space, should not be excluded. Patriarchy, that constantly produces itself through the institutionalization of malestream, controls and disciplines women's labour forces by determining the workplace and the work itself. While this structure, which forms the basis of the patriarchal system, constantly produces itself in daily life, the “assurance is subcontracted”. For the article, although the data of the doctoral thesis completed in 2010 with twenty-eight participants are instructive, this study is based on the narratives of two women who are also the participants of the PhD thesis and work in the same place. In the following years, the data was traced. Therefore, the aim of the study is to discuss how masculinity manifests in work, space and society and how it is reflected in daily life through the concept of "assurance".

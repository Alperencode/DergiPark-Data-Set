Makale Başlığı: NARRATIVES ABOUT MENSTRUATION IN TURKEY: SELF-SHAME, SUPPRESSION AND SILENCE
Özet: In this study, we explore how women perceive menstruation in Turkey. The general discourse in Turkey defines menstruation as an adverse and even dirty biological process mainly described as “being ill” and/or making women unable to worship until becoming clean again. Experiences of menstruation also shape women’s identities to a certain extent and create adverse feelings as a fundamental part of womanhood in Turkey. The experiences of the participants reflect the dynamic interactions among being suppressed, feeling self-shame, and being silent. The main dataset of this study was collected from December 2021 to February 2022 in Turkey via 20 online in-depth interviews conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire.

Makale Başlığı: Theoretical and Methodological Analysis of Graduate Studies on Public Relations and Advertising Conducted Between 1980-1992
Özet: The years between 1980 and 1992 correspond to the beginning of academic studies on public relations and advertising including the identification of related problems in the field and the writing of first graduate theses. Through this first generation of graduate work, we can trace the development of academic perspectives shaping the fields. Although studies on public relations and advertising have today reached an academic level worthy to be separately studied, the flourishing of graduate theseshappened between 1980 and 1992 before the two fields were institutionally transformed into a faculty. Hence this article treats the graduate studies on public relations and advertising together. It also demonstrates that they were directed by not only scholars of communication, but also scholars from various disciplines. In fact, most studies defining the field were produced by scholars trained in different disciplines. The data presented in this article demonstrates that the first theses weredescriptive in nature, whereas the topics diversified in later works. For more reliable conclusions regarding topics covered in later graduate studies, the present findings should be evaluated together with data from after the establishment of the Faculties of Communication in 1992 until 2009. This article hopes to serve as a guide for such future works.

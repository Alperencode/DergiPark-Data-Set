Makale Başlığı: A Systematic Review of Graduate Studies on Flipped Classrooms in English Language Teaching in Turkey
Özet: In recent years, the flipped classroom approach has drawn attention from practitioners and researchers in English language teaching (ELT) with the advances in technology. However, there is no research systematically reviewing graduate studies conducted in Turkey. For this purpose, this systematic review aims to investigate the main features and findings of graduate studies concerning the flipped classroom approach in the field of ELT, reveal possible benefits and challenges in the Turkish context, and make suggestions for practitioners and future research. The study examined all the master theses and doctoral dissertations (n= 32) on flipped classrooms in ELT based on the Council of Higher Education (CoHE) Theses database in Turkey between 2013 and 2021. It adopted a systematic review, and the qualitative content analysis was utilized as a research method. The findings revealed that there had been a growing interest to flip English language classes in Turkey since 2014. Along with the advantages of the flipped classroom approach outnumbering the disadvantages, flipping classrooms has brought new challenges for teachers and learners. Therefore, it seems that there is still room for further research to investigate teachers’ and learners’ autonomy and readiness, and flipping at K-12 levels of education.

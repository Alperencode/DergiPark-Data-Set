Makale Başlığı: A BIBLIOMETRIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF AUDIT QUALITY ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SSCI AND GRADUATE THESIS MADE IN TURKEY
Özet: It is seen that the issue of audit quality has gained importance after the financial scandals and crises in the world. Studies in the field of accounting and auditing serve the audit quality in a broad sense. In particular, in this study, it was desired to investigate studies on audit quality. For this purpose, first of all, articles in the journals within the scope of the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) database were scanned and 290 articles were analyzed bibliometrically. Then, in order to see how these international studies are reflected in Turkey, the theses available in the database of CoHE National Thesis Center were scanned and 73 graduate theses that were determined to be written on audit quality were analyzed with the same thought and some comparisons were made. While the articles in question are handled according to the variable of year, journal, citation and keyword frequency, graduate theses are based on the variable of subject, gender, year, university/institute, author, advisor, language, genre, scope, method, number of pages, number of keywords and frequency analyzed accordingly.As a result of the research, it was seen that the most articles were published in the journal with the name "Auditing-A Journal of Practice & Theory" (17 percent) in 2019, and audit quality (189 times) was the most repeated keyword. It has been seen that the most graduate theses in Turkey were written in 2019 and "audit quality" (40 times) was the most repeated keyword. The theses were mostly completed at Marmara University (12.3 percent) and under the supervision of professors (53.4 percent); It was understood that 41.1 percent of the theses included auditors and the vast majority (75.3 percent) focused on "external audit".

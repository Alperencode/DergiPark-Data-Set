These are (deaths) constitute 5% to 7% of the total death cases in the world. In addition, according to the ILO, the number of employees who die due to work accidents and occupational diseases tends to increase from year to year. In addition, every year 374 million employees are exposed to non-fatal injuries from occupational accidents. When referring to Turkey's performance in terms of work-related fatalities, unfortunately, there is no heartwarming situation. In terms of the fatal incidence rate of occupational accidents, it is seen to have the worst performance compared to the European Union countries (EU-28), and the third worst performance after India and Russia when compared with the countries reporting data to the ILO. In this study, fatal occupational accidents occurred in Turkey are analyzed which were happened in 2019 in order to draw attention to the human dimension of work-related accidents by using the data of Health and Safety Labour Watch Assembly (HSLWA). Also the effectiveness of the Law No. 6331 on Occupational Health and Safety has been evaluated by examining Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) data of Turkey between the years 2012-2019. Finally, a new model has been proposed as a solution to fatal occupational accidents.

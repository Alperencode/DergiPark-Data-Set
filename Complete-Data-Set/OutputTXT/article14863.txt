Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of Sensorial Comfort in Woven Women’s Blouses
Özet: The aim of this research was to investigate women's blouses in terms of sensorial comfort.  In the research, a “Sensorial Comfort Assessment Model” including objective measurements and subjective evaluations was created. The objective measurement results showed that the silk fabric was the lightest and thinnest, the polyester fabric was tightest, softest, loosest, driest and most resistant to wrinkle and the lyocell fabric was the heaviest one with the lowest air permeability. The subjective evaluation results showed that the fabrics were categorized into three groups as silk-polyester-viscose, cotton-lyocell and linen according to their similarities. In summary, the similarity coefficients between the objective measurement results and the subjective evaluation results obtained by touching the fabrics were at a low level; however, the level of similarities between the subjective evaluation results obtained by touching the fabrics and wearing the blouses were higher.

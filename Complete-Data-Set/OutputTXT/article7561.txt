Makale Başlığı: The Role of International Maritime Traffic on PM10 Pollutant in the Strait of Istanbul (Bosphorus)
Özet: Today, over 90 percent of world trade is carried out via maritime transportation by 90,000 vessels. Like all modes of transportation that use fossil fuels, ship emissions that significantly contribute to global climate change and acidification. In this aspect, the shipping industry is responsible for a significant proportion of the global climate change problem. According to data of International Maritime Organization (IMO), more than 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions can be attributed to ocean-going ships. Furthermore, in European coastal areas, shipping emissions contribute with 1–7% of ambient air PM10 levels, 1–14% of PM2.5, and at least 11% of PM1 (Viana et al., 2014). Strait of Istanbul is the unique waterway between Black Sea countries and the rest of the world. As a result of the its intensive international maritime traffic, it is a serious emission factor for the city. Studies have shown that only ship emissions cause 4500 deaths per year in the Marmara region. In this study, it is discussed whether international maritime traffic is an effective factor on PM10 emissions by comparing number of passing ship from Strait of Istanbul and pm10 values between 2014 and 2018.

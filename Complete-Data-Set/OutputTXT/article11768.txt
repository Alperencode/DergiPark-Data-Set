Makale Başlığı: A Comparitive Study of Space Syntax Analysis between Traditional Antakya Houses and Social Housing Complexes by TOKI
Özet: Space syntax analysis method is used to define the regions, cities, built environments, building groups, spatial models, and indoor organizations at different scales and to examine their interaction with social structure. This study aimed to analyse the spatial organization of traditional atria by using the space syntax method and to reveal the socio-cultural effect of atria. The spatial morphology and behavioural models regarding the traditional Antakya houses and social houses built by the Housing Development Administration of the Republic of Turkey, the institution that has the largest share in the construction of high-rise buildings in Turkey, were compared and analysed through the space syntax method As a result of the study, it has been determined that the privacy of family and women directly affects the design in traditional Antakya houses. On the other hand in TOKI buildings has been observed that individual privacy was given more importance and it has been determined that this was not created by building design decisions, but by the entrance doors of the rooms.

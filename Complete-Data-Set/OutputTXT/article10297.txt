Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF PERIODONTAL BONE LOSS AND TREATMENT NEEDS OF PATIENTS ACCORDING TO THE COVID-19
Özet: Objective: This study aimed to evaluate patients' periodontal bone loss and treatment needs according to the COVID-19 and determine whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 and periodontal disease.Method: This cross-sectional study included patients admitted to the periodontology department for treatment between April 2021 and July 2021. According to the personal health system records of the patients, a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test indicated a positive COVID-19 history [COVID(+)], whereas no positive PCR in the records was defined as a negative history [COVID(-)]. Periodontal treatment need was assessed by the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN). In addition, periodontal bone loss (PBL) was measured from the digital panoramic radiographs according to the Progressive Rate Index (PRI). Results: The study was conducted with 138 patients [COVID(+) 73, COVID(-) 65]. There was no statistically significant difference between COVID(+) and COVID(-) in terms of age and sex. The number of smokers in COVID(-) was significantly higher than COVID(+) (p: 0.045). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding the PRI and the presence of PBL. While COVID(+) had a greater percentage of score 0, 1, 3, and 4 than COVID(-); COVID(-) had a higher percentage of score 2 (p<0.000). However, it was found that the mean CPITN score did not differ significantly between the groups.Conclusion: This study revealed that there is no trend regarding the association between COVID-19 and periodontal disease. Future studies with more hospitalized patients are needed.

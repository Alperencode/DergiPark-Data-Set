Makale Başlığı: Sources and Methods of Ibn Qurqmās's (d. 882/1478) Tafsir "Fath al-Rahmān fî tafsîr al-Qur'an"
Özet: Ibn Korkmaz, who lived in Cairo during the Mamluks reign in the 9th century, is a mufassir who produced works in many scientific fields. Tabakat books give information about him, and there are copies of his works in some libraries in Istanbul and in various countries around the world. This article has been written because there is no academic study in our country on the commentary of Fath al-Rahmān fî tafsîr al-Qur'an, which is considered to be finest work of Ibn Korkmaz. In this study, brief information about the life and works of the mufassir is given, the main sources of tafsir are revealed and the method is explained. Fath al-Rahmān, which has 20 volumes, has the characteristic of narration in terms of interpreting the Qur'an with the Qur'an, the Qur'an with the Sunnah, the words of the Companions and the Tabi'in, and the knowledge of the sirah; it has the characteristics of tafsīr of ishārī in terms of dealing with prudence and mystical issues in terms of fiqh, kalam, qiraah, of morphology consummation, syntax, rhetoric, poetry and concept explanation. The work has been tried to be briefly introduced with these aspects. Ibn Korkmaz's success about expressions with saj opened the door for him to summarize his voluminous work and to write his tafsir which was written with saj  from beginning to end, under the name Nathr al-jumān al-muntazam min fath al-Rahmān.

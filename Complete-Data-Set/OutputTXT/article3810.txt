Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES IN PROVIDING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Özet: Innovation has become one of the main differentiators in the competitive race, as increasing globalization, rapid technological changes and new lifestyles open up enormous strategic opportunities for corporations. The successful use of new ideas is crucial for an organization to improve its processes, bring new products and improved services to market, increase efficiency and most importantly improve performance. With this study, it is aimed to examine the relationship between innovation and strategic choices of hospitals. In line with the purpose of the research, a survey was conducted with hospital senior managers in a total of 79 public, university and private hospitals operating in seven different regions of Turkey. Whether innovation and competition strategies differ according to various variables was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, correlation and regression analyzes were applied to determine the relationship between innovation and competitive strategies. As a result of the analyzes, it was determined that the variables used to divide the patients into groups did not differ according to the characteristics of the hospitals, and there was no relationship between the separation of the patients into groups and the competitive strategies. At the same time, a significant moderate relationship was found between supporting innovation activities in hospitals and all three competitive strategies.

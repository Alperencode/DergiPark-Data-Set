Makale Başlığı: Determination of Complementary and Alternative Methods Referred by Women Exposed to Covid-19
Özet: The spread of COVID-19 has caused many physical, psychological and social challenges despite the existence of treatment strategies. Many people are looking for complementary and alternative methods to prevent such diseases and their side effects. In this study, complementary and alternative methods and protective practices applied by women exposed to COVID-19 infection to protect themselves from COVID-19 disease or during the treatment process of the disease were examined. The ages of the mothers participating in the study ranged from 18-49. It has been determined that 90% of women exposed to COVID-19 transmission use non-drug practices. The finding that women need to benefit from Complementary and Alternative Methods indicates that it is important for healthcare professionals to develop the boundaries of care for individuals exposed to COVID-19 transmission and to plan to meet their needs regarding the use of Complementary and Alternative Methods with evidence-based information.

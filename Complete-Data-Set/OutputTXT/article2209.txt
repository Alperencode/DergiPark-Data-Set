Makale Başlığı: Sandwich Production, Types, Properties and Packaging
Özet: In recent years, the changing lifestyle has led people to consume ready-made food. Recently, the increasing type of "fast food" has left the place of unhealthy ready-made foods to healthy, functional snacks. With the increase in ready-to-eat food consumption, studies on packaging techniques to extend the shelf life of food continue to increase in parallel. Shelf life studies are carried out to create minimum loss in taste, texture and nutritional elements of the product. In this direction, in this review study, the latest developments in the production and packaging of sandwiches, an important snack product with a rapidly increasing potential in recent years, are included. Sandwiches usually consist of ingredients such as bread, vegetables, sauces, meat and dairy products. Sandwiches, which have hot or cold varieties, also have varieties such as open, closed and rolls. Bread varieties such as white, rye, whole wheat, whole grain, lavash, tortilla, Focaccia and French bread are commonly used in sandwiches. Modified atmosphere packaging is the most widely used packaging technique for sandwiches. It is thought that the importance of the sandwich, which can be prepared in different ways in the ready-made food sector, will increase in the coming years.

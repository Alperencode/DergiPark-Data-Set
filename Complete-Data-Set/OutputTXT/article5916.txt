Makale Başlığı: Approximately Near Rings in Proximal Relator Spaces
Özet: The motivation of this article is to define approximately near rings, some types of approximately near rings, approximately $N$-groups, approximately ideals, and approximately near rings of all descriptive approximately cosets. Moreover, some properties of these approximately algebraic structures are given. Furthermore, approximately near-ring homomorphisms are introduced and their some properties are investigated.

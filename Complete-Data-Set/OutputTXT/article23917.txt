Özet: In this study, proverbs and aphorisms were identified and classified in the work called Ey Vatan, which was widely appreciated and read since its first edition by our nation, and it is telling the memories of an important period for Turkey. It is a work that describes the state and politics of the homeland and nation, which is a meaningful and important value for Turkey. This book should be an ax to shatter the frozen values within you. Osman Pamukoğlu talks about the rebirth of a nation defeated in the First World War and how the Turks heroically defended their homeland. Ey vatan, contains the views of a general about homeland, war and leadership who served in the Turkish army for more than 30 years and went through fire in the Southeast, and it emerged from his experiences. It is striking that proverbs and aphorisms are used in this work. It is quite remarkable that proverbs and aphorisms are used quite appropriately in this work. With this study, it is hoped that the work ‘Ey Vatan Friends Wake Up From Sleep’ will be remembered by the Turkish Nation again.

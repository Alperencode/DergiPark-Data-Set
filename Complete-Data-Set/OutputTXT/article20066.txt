Makale Başlığı: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night (1934): The Lost Generation of America in the Aftermath of the First World War
Özet: This article offers a critical reading of the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald’s last novel titled Tender Is the Night (1934) by looking at the impact of the First World War on the lives of the Lost Generation of the Americans in the context of the Roaring Twenties. As the novel comments on the times by focusing on the dissipation and final demise of its protagonist Dick Diver, an American expat in France, this paper, focusing on this very theme, aims to draw attention to the trauma of the Great War as reflected on a lost generation represented by Dick Diver as well as a shellshock and war veteran Abe North. While working on this issue of the traumating effect of the war on the individual, this study, to better grasp the historical context of the novel, also provides a succinct historical overview explaining such concepts as the Lost Generation and the Roaring Twenties as well as the U.S government’s entry into WWI in 1917. One conclusion that this reading arrives at is that despite a tenuous mention of the First World War in the narrative, Tender is the Night is an era novel which sheds light on the post-war period of the Roaring Twenties in America by highlighting the disillusionments of a nation traumatized by the bleak realities of the Great War, through the example of Dick Diver as a broken individual.

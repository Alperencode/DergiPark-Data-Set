Makale Başlığı: Archaic vocabulary in Şerh-i Cezire-i Mesnevi
Özet: Archaic words are words that were used in the past but are no longer used in written language nowadays. Detection of these words is very important in order to observe the development of the language over time. Examining the old texts in terms of language plays a great role in Classical Turkish Literature studies. In this sense, Classical Turkish Literature works have differences in terms of vocabulary compared to today's Turkish. Not only the density of Arabic and Persian words, but also archaic Turkish words are astonishing to the reader. In this study, archaic words in the work called Şerh-i Cezire-i Mesnevi, which was written in the seventeenth century, were tried to be determined. Written by Abdülmecid Sivasî, this work is a commentary of a work written on Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi's Mesnevi-i Manevi. Yusuf-ı Sineçak wrote a work called Cezire-i Mesnevi with selected couplets from Mesnevi-i Manevi. Cezire-i Mesnevi was loved and admired. For this reason, many commentaries have been written on this work. One of these commentaries is Abdülmecid Sivasî's work called Şerh-i Cezire-i Mesnevi. When we examine the language of this work, 63 archaic words that are out of use today have been identified. The meanings of these words were determined and the words were presented to the reader in alphabetical order. Of the 63 identified archaic words, 29 are still being used in some regions today. With compilation dictionaries, these were determined and information was obtained in which regions they were used.

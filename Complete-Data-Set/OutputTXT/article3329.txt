Makale Başlığı: Serum Amino Acid Profile in Chronic Sinusitis
Özet: Objective: Serum amino acid profile is known to vary in many diseases. The changes in the serum amino acid profile provide important information about diseases and the effectiveness of treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate whether serum amino acids are effective in the development of CRS. Methods: A total of 23 healthy volunteers between the ages of 20 and 40 years were allocated to the control group (Group 1) and 27 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were allocated to the study group (Group 2). The patients whose history, symptom, and examination findings were consistent with chronic sinusitis and who also who had sinusitis findings on a paranasal sinus tomography and were diagnosed with chronic sinusitis for at least one year were included in Group 2. A total of 32 serum-free amino acid levels were measured in both group using the LC-MS/MS system. In the study, the JASEM amino acid kit was used for LC-MS/MS analysis. Results: The serum taurine level was found to be statistically significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (p:0.002). A significant alteration was not observed in the serum levels of remaining 31 amino acids. Conclusion: According to the data we obtained from the study, decreased serum taurine level may be a factor in the etiopathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis and therefore taurine supplementation may be considered as a new therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.

Makale Başlığı: Laser Cladding Application Using Different Powder Materials on Spheroidal Graphite Cast Iron Mold Material
Özet: Laser cladding is based on the principle of melting the base material via a laser beam by spraying the powder material; it comes to stand out by providing a new approach by creating surface modification. Using UTP PLASweld Ferro55 and UTP PLASweld 73G3 powder materials, laser cladding was implemented on GGG-70L ductile cast iron die material; the effects of two different powder filling materials on the cladding quality were investigated. The obtained results were aimed to be used in automotive sheet metal forming die repairs. The effects of laser power, scanning speed, powder flow rate parameters on weld geometry, microhardness, crack, and pore formations were investigated, and optimum process parameters were determined by using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Using high-level laser power (1,7 kW) for Ferro55 material and low-level scanning speed (9 mm/s) parameters for UTP 73G3 powder material were achieved optimum results in terms of welding geometry. While Ferro 55 material was better in terms of pore formation; UTP 73G3 material had a lower risk of crack formation. The maximum microhardness values obtained were close to each other (777,3 HV0,1.).

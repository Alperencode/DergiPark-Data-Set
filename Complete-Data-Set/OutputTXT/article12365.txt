Makale Başlığı: THE AUKUS DEAL THROUGH A NEOCLASSICAL REALIST LENS: OFFSHORE BALANCING AND ELITE PERCEPTIONS
Özet: The AUKUS deal, signed by the USA, England and Australia has revealed a new alliance dynamic within the Indo-Pacific geopolitics. The deal, which was met with surprise and attracted the reaction of many actors concerning the region, differs from the known alliance treaties in terms of its structure. Rather than giving any security guarantees to Australia, the treaty provides the delivery of American-made nuclear-powered submarines to Australian navy. In this respect, it is understood that the agreement in question is an offshore balancing strategy which will expected to support the regional policies of the USA and the UK.This acquisition of the Australian navy, while affecting the regional balance  of power, also led to the cancellation of the arms sales agreement between Canberra and France. Although none of the signatory states used a statement against China, the treaty was also met with a reaction by China. Therefore, the AUKUS may have costs besides its gains and it is thus important to understand the perceptions of the ruling elites regarding the constraints and opportunities in the current international system and the regional threat environment. In this paper, the AUKUS deal was evaluated through the analytical methods of neoclassical realism which allows analyzing the perceptions of the ruling elites.

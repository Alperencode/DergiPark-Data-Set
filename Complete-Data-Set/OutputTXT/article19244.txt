Makale Başlığı: Teaching Italians Turkish: Letters and Sounds
Özet: Abstract: This paper aims at examining the way Turkish sounds and letters are taught based on three text books that teach Turkish to Italians. Il Turco Parlato, published in 1910, was used for a period of time as a speaking comprehension text book. The second book, Manual of Turkish Language, was written after the Language Reform, and was used at the time in the universities. The last book, Corso di Lingua, is the main object of this study since it is used today in Italian universities. As these books teach sounds and letters as the first subject while teaching the Turkish grammar, the paper identified and classified subjects related to phonetics. This classification was the base of our analysis. It seems that authors generally organize their books according to the order of grammar books written in the Italian Turcology tradition, and that they utilized letters and sound equivalents as their point of departure, in a similar manner to previously written text book.Keywords: Turkish for Italian, Italian Turcology, alphabet, sound, letters.

Makale Başlığı: The Structural Characteristics of Sheep Farming in Aksaray Province
Özet: The purpose of this study was to determine the current status of sheep breeders in Aksaray province, as well as the structural characteristics of sheep farms. The survey questions, which were prepared for this purpose and consisted of a total of 68 questions, were directed to the farmers face to face and the answers were recorded. The obtained data was evaluated by frequency analysis. According to the results of the questionnaire, the breeders were composed of 5-7 family members, and their educational status was mostly at the primary school level. The breeders reported that they primarily raised Akkaraman breeds for meat, milk, and fleece. The breeders, who usually have closed pens, raise their sheep in the pasture and supplement feeding. It has been determined that sheep are mated for the first time at the age of 18 months in the province and September is preferred for ram joining. Milking was done by hand on the farms and turned into cheese. It has been reported that these cheeses are frequently sold at retail. They reported that while at least one health protection program was implemented in enterprises, they experienced the most toe-nail and abortion problems. The producers, whose main problem is the cost of feed, stated that they demand veterinary services and breeding stock from the government.

Makale Başlığı: Solidarity Architecture: Socially-Minded Approaches Emerging in the Professional Practice in Architecture
Özet: This article evaluates the various forms of emerging approaches in the professional conduct of the architectural practice and other forms of professional activities related to the design, planning, and space making in general, making explicit or inherent use of the notion of solidarity as an approach, method, and means of communication. A broad review of the evolution of the status of the professional attitude has been made with consideration of the changing social dynamics and social movements, throughout the recent history of modernization. The common characteristics observed with the adoption of the professional solidarity approach, are the dissolving of the duality and distinction between the professional and the community, the shift or enlargement of the target of the professional activity from the individual or people in need to a wider community, most of the time being the oppressed, less privileged, deprived and disadvantaged sections of the society. In line with this description, the concept of Solidarity Architecture can be evaluated to be an understanding in architecture attaching importance to the performance of the professional activities which are determinant in the formation of the built physical environment in a socially minded manner and together with the interacted social groups.

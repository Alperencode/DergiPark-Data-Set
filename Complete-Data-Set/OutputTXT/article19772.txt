Makale Başlığı: Experimental Investigation of Performance and Emission Characteristics on Mini-scale Turbojet Engine Fueled with JetA1- Canola Methyl Ester (CME) Fuel Blends
Özet: The focus of this study is the experimental investigation of the effects of canola methyl ester (CME) and Jet-A1 fuel blends on performance and emissions of the mini-scale turbojet engine at different blend ratios and real flight power levels. Accordingly, B2.5 (2.5% CME-97.5% Jet-A1), B5 (5% CME-95% Jet-A1) and B10 (10% CME-90% Jet-A1) fuel blends and pure Jet-A1 fuel and power rates of taxi (7%), approach (30%), climb (85%) and take-off (100%) were tested and examined for static thrust, TSFC, EGT, emissions, noise and thermal efficiency. The results obtained show that up to 5% CME addition in turbojet engine has a maximum reduction effect of 19.6% on thrust, while this ratio is much less in partial power situations. This effect also causes an increase in the TSFC value. While the CO2 value increased with the addition of CME, it caused a decrease in the CO and unburned HC values. However, the addition of CME caused increasing on noise level especially in taxi power state (about 7.8%), while no significant noise increase was observed in other power states. In terms of thermal efficiency, it has been observed that all fuel blends reduce efficiency in different power states, and it can be said that especially B5 fuel blend can be used as a blend fuel in gas turbine engines at partial loads.

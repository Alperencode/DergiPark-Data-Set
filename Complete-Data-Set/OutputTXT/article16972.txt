Makale Başlığı: Terry Pratchett’s Interesting Times As An Example Of Political Satire
Özet: Satire, which is a humorous criticism to take the society further from its current location, can be defined as a tradition that has been intertwined with literature for centuries. Political satire, an important part of satire, is thought to have developed with modern satire, which is characterized by the prominence of social criticism. The fact that criticisms of politics and therefore society reach people through literary texts emphasizes the importance of literature at this point. When the criticism is used in a fantastic world, it can be more interesting for readers and the messages given can be understood much more clearly since the readers isolate themselves from the work. Readers have the opportunity to evaluate the events that take place in a fantasy world without being influenced by the prejudices, beliefs and political ideologies of our real world, and in this way, they can evaluate the issues related to our real world from a different perspective with a critical point of view. The English author Terry Pratchett is one of the first names that come to mind when satirical and fantasy literature is mentioned together. In Pratchett’s Discworld novels series, which consists of forty-one novels, it is possible to find his messages including his satires about society, politics, environment and economy between the lines of his novels. In this study, it is aimed to analyse the political satire in the novel, Interesting Times, selected from the Discworld series. Also, while analysing the novel, various satirical techniques such as unexpected honesty, unexpected event and irony, suggested by Feinberg are used; the author’s word choices were taken into consideration, and how these techniques used in the novel were revealed with the appropriate quotations from the novel.

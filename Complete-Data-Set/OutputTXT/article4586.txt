Makale Başlığı: The Interaction of Ibâdiyya-Mu'tazila in the Context of the Views of al-Asmâ ve'l-Ahkam
Özet: The events of strife that took place during the years of Ali's caliphate led to the start of sectarian movements. As a result of the socio-political events of this period, various issues were discussed in different gatherings. The relationship between "faith-great sin", one of the topics discussed, was the most important issue on the agenda. Basra was at the forefront of the places where these discussions were held. Ibadiyya had an important position among the groups active in Basra. Likewise, Mu'tazila had a considerable weight in scientific circles. When the views of both sects are examined, there are similar opinions on some issues. Although it does not seem possible to think that there will be an interaction between the Bedouin origin Ibâdiyya on the one hand, and the Mu'tazila of mawâli origin, on the other hand, the examples of intellectual closeness mentioned in the works bring to mind the existence of an intellectual interaction between these two sects. In our article, in the context of " al-asmâ wa’l-ahkâm" views, we will try to determine the similarity of the ideas between the two sects, especially considering the formation periods, and to reveal the interaction that we think exists between them.

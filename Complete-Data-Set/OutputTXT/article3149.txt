Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Nurses' Way of Expressing The Meaning and Purpose of Life and Their Belief in the Transformative Power of Suffering
Özet: This study aims to present the relationship among nurses' expressions of the meaning and purpose of life and their belief in the transformative power of suffering. 446 nurses working in two separate hospitals participated in the study. In the data collection, the Transformative Power of Suffering Scale and the Meaning and Purpose of Life Scale were employed. The study concluded that the nurses working in a city hospital, married, and working in the profession for four years or more, find life more meaningful. There was no statistical difference between the transformative power of suffering and demographic variables. A moderate positive relationship between the Meaning of Life scale sub-dimension and the Transformative Power of Suffering Scale and a weak relationship in the negative direction with the meaninglessness of life sub-dimension was discovered.  It can be concluded that all of the nurses believe that pain has a transformative power and that the institution they work in and their working time are effective in their outlook on life.

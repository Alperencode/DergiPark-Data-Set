Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Unemployment and The Covid 19 Pandemic on Bauman's Understanding of Freedom and Uncertainty
Özet: Bauman’s sociology brings a critical perspective on society,ideologies,identities,the state,utopia,ethics,modernism and postmodernism.In this context;changing world conditions,collective and individual living spaces,bring additional responsibility for solving problems.In social life,areas of freedom intersect and this situation creates new demands.Bauman attributes the intersection of areas of freedom to the fact that conflicts of interest in the global capitalism never end in modernism.The effort of modernity to establish an order of freedom has not removed ambiguities,contrary,it has led to the restriction of freedom.Postmodernism has absolutized the concepts of freedom and uncertainty;has been seen as a road to freedom. Neoliberalism the ally of postmodernism, aims to establish a new order that will protect the interests of the ruling classes,apart from abandoning the social state understanding.In this order,where classification becomes obvious;future anxiety,unemployment,poverty,income injustice are also inevitable.In addition,factors such as theconsequences of global warming and climate changes,the proliferation of infectious diseases and their transformation into a pandemic;causes class differences and separations to become evident.The study will assess the global capitalism defined in Bauman sociology,the insecurity,unemployment and COVID 19 effect that the idea of freedom-uncertainty that it brings in the working life.A qualitative study was conducted.In the effort to create freedom,especially the unemployment problem caused by uncertainty and insecurity,the results have been tried to be revealed by document analysis method.Conditions that became even more uncertain with the COVID 19 have increased unemployment globally.Particularly,the closure measures taken due to the pandemic have narrowed production and employment opportunities.In this study,the ways of reducing unemployment,with the pandemic,were discussed in Bauman's emphasis on uncertainty.

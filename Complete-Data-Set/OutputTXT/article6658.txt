Makale Başlığı: Back to the Past: Is the West  Moving from Crisis Management to Full-Spectrum Deterrence Including Nuclear Force?
Özet: During the Cold War, the West tried to deter and contain the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. This deterrence was based on both conventional and nuclear forces and various concepts and doctrines. After both sides achieved an assured destruction capability, deterrence was achieved by nuclear balance. Once the Cold War ended, the focus shifted from deterrence and containment to crisis management as the international security environment became dominated by internal conflicts, international terrorism, global crime, and problems related to failed states like refugee crises. This resulted in defence cuts as neither side expected a significant conventional and nuclear war. However, this security perception has changed after Russia annexed Crimea and then invaded Ukraine. Recent Western measures to deter Russia, such as deploying conventional forces to Eastern Europe, resemble the Cold War mentality. Accordingly, this paper examines recent developments in the international security environment compared to the Cold War era. It finds that states and alliances have increased their defence budgets and implemented harsh measures to ensure their security and deter potential aggressors.

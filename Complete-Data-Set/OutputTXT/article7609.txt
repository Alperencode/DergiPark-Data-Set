Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF ANXIETY LEVELS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS ON THEIR TREATMENT ADHERENCE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PERIOD
Özet: This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the anxiety levels of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients on their treatment adherence in the COVID-19 pandemic period. The sample of this descriptive and cross-sectional study consisted of 313 DM patients who presented to the internal medicine outpatient clinic between 01.01.2021 and 01.02.2021. The data were collected using a Personal Information Form, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman’s correlation test were used to analyze the data. The mean CAS score of the DM patients was 7.89±3.87, while their mean total MMAS-8 score was 4.06±1.56. It was determined that the patients who were using oral antidiabetic medications, those adhering to their medication and diet treatment, and those who were not COVID-19 had higher levels of anxiety. There was a negative significant relationship between the MMAS-8 and CAS scores of the patients (p<0.05). It was determined that as the anxiety levels of the DM patients increased in the pandemic process, their treatment adherence levels decreased. To reduce the anxiety levels and increase the treatment adherence of DM patients in the COVID-19 pandemic period, sufficient information, psychosocial support and a multidisciplinary approach should be provided.

Makale Başlığı: Body Image, Emotion Regulation Difficulty and Eating Attitudes in Adolescents by Separation-Individuation Level and Gender
Özet: The aim of the study was to investigate body perception and emotion regulation difficultyfactors determining eating attitudes of adolescents. As well, evaluate the impactof separation-individualization levels and gender on eating attitudes of adolescents. Theparticipants were 424 adolescents between the ages of 18 and 22. The instruments usedwere the Emotion Regulation Difficulty Scale, the Separation Individualization Scale,the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) and the Body Image Scale. Accordingto the findings, the level of separation-individuation is a determining factor in the eatingattitude of adolescents, and body image predicted restrictive eating behavior in the groupthat does not develop pathology, and emotional eating behavior in the group with a highprobability of developing pathology. In terms of gender it is found that emotional eatingis explained by body image, openness, goals, strategies, and refusal in women who aremore likely to show pathology. As for men with a high probability pathology, emotionaleating behavior was predicted by just openness. The results were discussed in the light ofrelated literature.

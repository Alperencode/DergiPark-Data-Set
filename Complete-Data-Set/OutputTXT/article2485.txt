Makale Başlığı: Effective Institute for Balkan Studies in Soviet Russia: Institute for Slavic Studies
Özet: The history of the study of the Balkans and the peoples of this region dates back to the middle of the 19th century in the history of Russian science. The first studies of this period were carried out by Russian diplomats and statesmen who were on duty in the Balkan lands. The main feature of these studies, which are mainly focused on numerical data and have limited data in the field of tradition and culture, is that they serve the Slavic ideology, which in Russian literature is defined as the "Slavic brotherhood". The work of Russian scientists in this area has acquired an academic character thanks to the "Institute of Slavic Studies", created during the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the studies of the Institute of Slavic Studies, as in previous studies, have mainly focused on the Slavic and Christian communities in the Balkans. The main difference between the two periods is that the religious factor that dominated during the Tsarist Russian period was replaced by the political factor during the Soviet period. In the new period, people and communities of Turkic origin or those who adopted the Islamic faith, settled in the Balkan lands, always remained in the background, and no multifaceted independent research was carried out on them. This situation led to the fact that in Russia the name of Balkan studies was eclipsed by the name of Slavic studies, Balkan studies and all activities in this area are shown within the framework of the concept of Slavic studies. This article will review the historical process and structure of the Institute of Slavic Studies, established during the period of Soviet Russia, as well as research and periodicals published by the Institute.

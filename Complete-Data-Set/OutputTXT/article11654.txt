The first of these are the fairy tales of the BrothersGrimm. The fairy tales of the world-famous Brothers Grimm contain many positive and negative elements in terms of pedagogy. In these narratives, on the onehand, there are positive core values such as honesty, resilience to difficult conditionsand benevolence, on the other hand, discourses that provoke misperceptionssuch as gender discourses and the depiction of marriage as a reward for the heroes,violence, scenes that can set a bad example for children, horror content, but alsonegative factors.In this study, the story of the Twelve Brothers by the brothers Jacob and WilhelmGrimm is analyzed with regard to gender discourses and using Vladimir Propp’smethod of structural narrative analysis. As a result, the idea prevailed not to includeGrimm’s fairy tales in children’s literature in the sense of gender discourse,but rather to protect them as a social cultural asset for adults. It incorporates universalmoral values such as honesty, kindness, and responsibility in children’s literatureand is free of gender discourse; It is recommended to choose content that isappropriate to the child’s developmental level and read it to the children.

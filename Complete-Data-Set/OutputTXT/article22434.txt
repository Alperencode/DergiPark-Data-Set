Makale Başlığı: Application of Lowest Cost Ration Formulation on Broiler Nutrition
Özet: In this study, the usefulness of mathematical modelling in animal nutrition and its benefits to producers were emphasized. In the application part, Microsoft Excell for Windows Version 2010 program prepared the final ration formulation in the most economical way from the 25th day to slaughter for broilers (broiler chickens) by using the solver module. An application had been made in experiment. This study could be done in other animal breeds. Recently, developments in computer technology were widely used in almost all areas of our lives, and animal breeders have had benefited from computers in preparing rations. This situation maximizes the profits of the producers were reduced the cost of feed to a minimum. In addition, the energy, protein, vitamin and mineral values needed by the animal were scientifically calculated and met with the lowest cost feeds. As a matter of fact, in case of low or excess of energy, protein, vitamin and mineral values needed by the animal, it was inevitable to havemany nutritional diseases. This situation causes serious damage to the farmers and frustrates the producers. Consequently, the continued development of such models and computer technology and the software for their application holds great promise for improvements in effectiveness at which basic animal function knowledge can be applied to improve animal agriculture and reduce its impact on the environment.Keywords: Animal nutrition, ration optimization, feed cost, optimizasyon

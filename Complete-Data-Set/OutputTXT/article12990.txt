Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of taste and odor problems caused by rainbow trout facilities with multi-criteria decision-making methods
Özet: Taste and odor problem caused by 2-MIB and geosmin is one of the most common problems seen in water resources. As a result of natural and anthropogenic pollution sources, water resources are polluted, and an earthy-moldy taste and odor occurs in the water. Aquaculture production facilities are the leading anthropogenic sources that cause taste and odor formation in water resources. In this study, it is aimed to determine the best treatment methods that can be used to eliminate the taste and odor problems caused by the formation of 2-MIB and geosmin by using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods in facilities operating in Turkey and where especially rainbow trout is produced. In the study, ozone-based processes, UV-based processes, activated carbon adsorption, aluminum coagulation, sand filtration, chlorination, chlorine dioxide, potassium permanganate, fenton-based processes and photo-fenton processes were used as alternative processes. The criteria chosen for the study were removal performance, reliability and durability, complexity, ease of planned maintenance, ease of construction, use of various chemicals, pre-treatment requirement, by-product formation, and suitability. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used in weighting the criteria in the study, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods were used in ordering the alternatives. According to the results obtained using TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, ozone-based processes were found to be the best treatment method that can be used for the removal of taste and odor components such as 2-MIB and geosmin resulting from rainbow trout production in concrete ponds.

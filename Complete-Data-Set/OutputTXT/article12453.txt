Makale Başlığı: “Lynch Culture” as an Unlawful Practical Tool of Directing Masses and Individuals: Ancient Rome (Republican Period) Example
Özet: The lynching movements, which are often seen in modern societies, for personal and political reasons, oriented towards individuals and groups physically or verbally, have been known in various societies and cultures throughout history. These kinds of practices, aimed at destroying or socially intimidating people and groups in the target, have emerged as a different but effective way for people and political groups to go beyond the boundaries of the defined law to provide their justice or political goals. Looting and intimidation of people or political rivals who do not comply with the norms set by society has been an essential factor in the Roman Empire of the Republican Period. It can be seen that these methods, which can be considered as primitive and cruel practices with a contemporary perspective, were referred to legal channels in ancient Rome in many cases or were accepted by the community layers and even by official institutions due to established practices (mos maiorum).

Traditional practices and implementations, one of contexts for manifestation and transfer of social memory, are environments where ritual knowledge is transfered, maintained and reanimated. ‘‘Nezir chirag’’ rituals, conducted in different forms qualitatively and quantitatively from the past to present day, have the nature of a traditional religious practice that is performed among Uyghur Turks. They integrate (seethe), on the same ritual, pre-islamic cults and practices such as tree, ancestors, water, fire and hearth through bloody and bloodless sacrifices which consecrate to the creator as well as Islamic practices such as performing an ablution, reciting the quran and performing the salaat and within the scope of this ritual, they abide by certain prohibitions and avoidances. In the study, the leading purpose is to determine nature, scope and features of time, space and implementation/performance of nezir chirag rituals, based on the concept nezir chirag and to analyze socio-cultural functions of the said rituals. In this context, nezir chirag rituals were subjected to an evaluation according to the right implementation/performance features from social category to individual one, and prohibitions and avoidances on the said rituals were further examined. In the study, nezir chirag ritual, performed in Uyhgur Turks, was presented by social-functional method. Rituals and their variations, being subject of the article, were determined based on knowledge which were obtained from literature review.

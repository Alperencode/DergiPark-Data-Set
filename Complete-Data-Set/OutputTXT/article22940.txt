Makale Başlığı: BENEFITS OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE IN TEACHING JAPANESE: MURAKAMI'S STORY "SAMSA IN LOVE
Özet: Although there are various literary studies on contemporary Japanese author Haruki Murakami's works, only few of them focus on how to use Murakami's texts as a course material. The aim of this study is to set an example on how second language learners can approach a story in terms of literary criticism in the courses where short story analysis will be carried out in Japanese philology classes or Comparative Literature depatments. Thus, this study not only intends to enhance the interpretation skills of the learners, but also improve their literary criticism skills by using the research methods of comparative literature. In this context, Murakami's Samsa in Love was compared with Kafka's Metamorphosis and analyzed with textual analysis method and reckoning method. While the similar plots, themes, symbols and motifs in both works were analyzed comparatively, the similarities and differences in the use of setting time and space were also tried to be determined. As a result, it has been deduced that the alienation of the individual from his own humanity is emphasized by referring to Kafka's Metamorphosis in Murakami’s work.

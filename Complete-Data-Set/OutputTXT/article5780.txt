Makale Başlığı: Armenian Migration to France in the Example of Oddo Camp, Camp Life of Armenians and French Attitudes towards Armenian Immigrants
Özet: Immigrant is a concept used to express those who leave their places of residence for various reasons. Some of the groups of people or nations within the scope of the specified word settled in France in the historical process. Armenians are among them, and their migration to France mainly took place in an environment where the World War I upset the existing order in the whole world. In line with their desire to seize Anatolian lands for many years, the French administration forcibly placed some of the Armenian immigrants in the Oddo Camp, which is one of the former military camps where no preparations were made. The French administrators deprived the camp residents of their standard practices in basic areas such as health care for their citizens. With their stated approach, they caused tuberculosis among the Armenians in France to reach very serious dimensions. The current attitudes of the French towards the Armenians, as they were called ‘indolent orientals’, caused the Armenians to feel the feeling of exclusion closely. In this respect, our study aims to reveal what kind of attitude they took in the face of a mass immigration movement towards one of the European states that used very harsh expressions and took a stand regarding immigration events that took place outside their borders. Today, when immigration and the treatment of immigrants are discussed intensively, the practice of placing Armenians in the Oddo Camp, with which France was in alliance for a while, the current situation of the Armenians in the camp and the French treatment of Armenian immigrants will be examined based on the sources of the period.

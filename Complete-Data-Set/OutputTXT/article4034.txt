Makale Başlığı: Immunohistochemical Localization of Cytokeratin 8 in Testes of Different Cat Breeds
Özet: Intermediate filaments are proteins belonging to cytoskeletal components formed by proteins of different origin and cell type. These proteins are in the testis; Sertoli, peritubular myoid and Leydig cells are known to exist. The aim of this study is to determine cytokeratin 8 protein, which is important for testicular physiology and participates in the cytoskeletal structure of the testis; To reveal the localization of Iranian, Ankara and Van breed cats in testicular tissue using immunohistochemistry technique. Tissue samples from healthy kittens (nine pairs) and adult (nine pairs) cats were used in the study. Tissue samples were subjected to immunohistochemical streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex staining method after routine histological procedures. In the staining results obtained, it was seen that cytokeratin 8 immunoreactivity in the examined areas in kittens and adult cats did not differ according to breeds. However, it was observed that immunoreactivity was negative in interstitial tissue and Leydig cells, but formed around the nucleus in Sertoli and germ cells. In addition, it was determined that there was a positive immunoreaction in the cytoplasm and nucleus in the epithelium of the epididymis and deferens ducts. As a result of the findings obtained, it was thought that cytokeratin 8 may cause some differences in mature cats and may play important roles such as the maturation of spermatogenesis, protection and transport of sperm by participating in the skeletal structure of some cells in the cat testicles.

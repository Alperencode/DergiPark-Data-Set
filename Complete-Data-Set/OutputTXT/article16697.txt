Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF GROWTH, DIVERSIFICATION AND DOWNSIZING STRATEGIES ON FIRM PERFORMANCE IN CHAINCING MARKETS: SECTORAL ANALYSIS
Özet: This study examines the effects of growth, diversification and downsizing strategies applied by companies operating in the manufacturing sector in Borsa Istanbul during market slowdowns and expansions on firm performance, according to each sector. For this purpose, it has been determined which of the growth, diversification and downsizing strategies are implemented in slowdown-expansion periods by the companies operating in the construction, automotive, pharmaceutical and chemical and food sectors, which are trading in the BIST 100 index between the years 2000-2016. In addition, it has been investigated whether there is a significant relationship between these strategies and firm performance, and the direction and degree of this relationship were analyzed and compared on a sectoral basis for slowdown-expansion periods. The difference of this study from other studies is that all three of the aforementioned strategies have not been evaluated together in Turkey and the effects of these strategies have not been compared on a sectoral basis for slowdown-expansion periods yet. In this study, firm performance was measured by the return on assets (ROA), the return on assets of cash flows (return on cash flows), Tobin's q, closing prices, rate of increase in assets, overall performance, total shareholder return and earnings per share.

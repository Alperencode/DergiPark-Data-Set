The research model employed was “multiple probe design with probe conditions across subjects” which is one of the single-subject research models. All sessions in the study were facilitated using Skype communication software.

Based on the study’s findings, it was concluded that the training program including telehealth coaching was positive effects for the teachers’ acquisition of the skills necessary to implement the DTT method. However, although it has positive effects on children's learning of imitation skills, additional studies are needed. In addition, the implemented training program was found useful and supportive by the participating teachers.

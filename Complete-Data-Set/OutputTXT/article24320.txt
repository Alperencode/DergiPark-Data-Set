Makale Başlığı: Refugee Women as Subaltern Feminity of Emphasized Feminity: Attitudes  Towards Syrian Refugee Women
Özet: In this study, the attitudes of the women living in Esenler, one of the most conservative and poor cities of Istanbul, to the Syrian refugee women that they neighbored were analyzed. The İssue has been addressed in the context of the critical attitude of the “emphasized feminity”, which is a complement to the “hegemonic masculinity”, in Connell’s “Gender Hierarchy Theory”, to the other “subaltern feminity”. The argument of this article is that the differences between the emhasized feminity and subaltern feminity do not have to be as contrary and mutually exclusive as the conceptualization of the “Gender Hierarchy”. In other words, the subaltern does not always have threatening qualities based on the heterosexual hegemonic system and it can fill the gray areas under this regime. As a matter of fact, in this research, it has been determined that women see Muslims as an important element in establishing their emphasized femininity. Moreover, women define Syrian women as women who are not Muslim, not enough Muslim. Being an adequate Muslim woman is defined as being honest, being a good wife, fulfilling domestic roles properly and having enough of her homeland. The findings obtained from indepth interviews with 47 women using qualitative research methods, the women who define femininity through Islam, the women who are Muslim, but poor and asylum-seekers, the Syrian women, the virtues, the roles of women, and so on. it points out how they position themselves at the bottom of the social hierarchy

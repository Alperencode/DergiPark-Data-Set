Makale Başlığı: A giant mediastinal ectopic goiter causing dyspnea and dysphagia
Özet: Primary mediastinal ectopic goiter (PMG) is defined asthe presence of thyroid tissue in the mediastinum without having a continuity between the cervical thyroidand the mediastinal goiter. A fifty-seven year-old man admitted to our clinicsuffering from dyspnea, chest pain, shortness of breath, and dysphagia for almosttwo months. Thorax computed tomography revealed a mass of 12 cm in theposterior mediastinum, compressing the trachea and esophagus. The mass isresected completely via a right thoracotomy.

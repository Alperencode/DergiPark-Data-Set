Makale Başlığı: PRE-HELLENISTIC WATER STRUCTURES IN ANATOLIA AND AMASYA
Özet: Water, which is one of the basic elements of human life, has been effective in the development of settlements established since ancient times while ensuring the continuity of life. Archaeological research carried out to date indicates that besides the vital importance of water in directing the physical formation of settlements, the religious meanings attributed to it are also effective.Anatolia, where the earliest settlements in the history of humanity developed, was also the geography where the world's first examples of water structures emerged. This study firstly deals with the relationship between water and settlement in Anatolia's first settlements established before the Hellenistic Period. In addition, it examines the first water structures of Anatolia, which show typological diversity such as cisterns, canals, wells, spring caves, dams, ponds, pools, and fountains, where surface and underground waters are used in these settlements, in chronological order. Then, it introduces the water structures that were determined to be built in this period and there is no information in the literature, revealing that the pre-Hellenistic settlements in Amasya were established in areas with rich surface and underground waters. Also, argues that there may be religious influences in the first examples of water architecture in Anatolia and Amasya.

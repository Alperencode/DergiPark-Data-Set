Makale Başlığı: A Place in the Past, a Moment in the Present: An Analysis on the Experience of Going to the Cinema in Eskişehir in the 1990’s with Oral History
Özet: From 1895 until today, many people have had the experience of going to the cinema. It can be said that this experience is lived by adhering to instant decisions and sometimes to a program. The experience of going to the movies varies by day, week, month, and especially year. This variable structure can be understood with an oral history study, which can reveal the memories of going to the cinema. The aim of this study, which was carried out within the framework of the oral history method, is to reveal the perceptions of the cinema venues and their experiences of going to the cinema by reaching the memories of the people who had the experience of going to the cinema in Eskişehir in the 1990’s. The problem of the study is to determine within the framework of which common themes these experiences are mostly lived. The study is important in that it conveys the experience of going to the cinema in Eskişehir in the 1990’s, based on the discourses of the people who had this experience, and that such a study for Eskişehir has not been included before. In the study, a total of 24 people were interviewed, and their experiences of going to the movies in those years were examined. As a result of the examination, it has been understood that there are important cinema venues that do not exist today, but that were the pioneers of socialization in those years, and that the situations specific to the 1990’s were included in the memories of going to the cinema.

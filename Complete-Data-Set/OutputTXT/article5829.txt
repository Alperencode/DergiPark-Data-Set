Makale Başlığı: OTTO NEURATH’S CONTRIBUTION TO DISCUSSIONS IN THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
Özet: According to Logical Empricists metaphysics is an important factor in strenghtening political ideologies such as conservatism and fascism. Probably one of the best places to look for these claims is in Otto Neurath’s studies and life. According to him, metaphysics should be considered in the social and political contexts. This is the reason why Neurath put the model of rational society that is purified from metaphysics at the center of the “Manifesto” (The Scientific Conception of the World: The Vienna Circle, Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung / Der Wiener Kreis). According to Neurath, the Vienna Circle should take this path. As he has Marxist tendencies, Neurath thinks that metaphysics is responsible for the stabilization and reproduction conservatism in social and political contexts. Today, studies focus on what is called the “left Vienna Circle” specifically take into consideration political position of Neurath. Accordingly, in the light of this background, in this paper I will evaluate Neurath’s own peculiar position within the Vienna Circle with respect to his studies on economics, philosophy and education. Thus, I do not argue for a normative claim, rather in a descriptive manner I aim to show a possible answer the question of what attitude could a philosopher of science adopt in the face problems we are facing the world today via Neurath’s understanding of eclectic philosophy of science. At the end, I hope these considerations would contribute to discussions as to how philosophy of science should reconstruct itself.

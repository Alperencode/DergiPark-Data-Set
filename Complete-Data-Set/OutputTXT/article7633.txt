Makale Başlığı: Coating TiO2 Film Using the Spin Method of AISI 304 Stainless Steel and Investigation of the Structural Properties
Özet: In this study, TiO2 ceramic oxide film with good passivity, low conductivity and good tribological properties was coated on stainless steel (AISI 304) material by sol gel spin coating method. The effect of annealing temperature and time on the structure of the coated TiO2 films was investigated. Ethyl acetoacetate (EAcAc), ethanol and as titanium source Tetra-n-butyl orthotitanate (TBT) was used for the coating process. In the TiO2 thin film coating process, 2600 rpm was chosen as the spin rotation speed. In order to examine the effect of annealing time and temperature on the coating structure, annealing was applied at treatment times of 1 and 1.5 hours and at processing temperatures of 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C. The structural properties of the coatings were investigated by XRD and SEM analysis. It was determined that the peaks obtained according to the analyzes were in the anatase and rutile phases. When the XRD results were examined, it was seen that the dominant peak was the Rutile (210) phase at all temperatures and times. In addition, parameters such as crystal size (D), dislocation density (δ) and strain (ε) were determined for the R(210) phase from XRD analysis. After the study, SEM analyzes were determined that the annealing temperature and time changed the surface morphology.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of risk factors playing a role in the transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare professionals
Özet: Introduction: Healthcare workers and professionals have the highest risk of transmission of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The risks faced by healthcare professionals can vary according to their working conditions, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. This study aimed to identify risk factors contributing to transmission among frontline healthcare providers in the pandemic period.Material and Method: The healthcare workers working at the school of medicine hospital and referred to the COVID-19 clinics by the filiation team following risky exposure between March 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included in the study. sociodemographic features, use of protective equipment, unprotected contact data, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results recorded on the contact healthcare follow-up form of the participants were taken from the hospital records and analyzed retrospectively.Results: Of the healthcare workers included in the study, 790 (58%) were female, and 571 (42%) were male, with a mean age of 33,6±8,3 years. SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity was detected in 94 (6%) participants. According to the multivariate model results, the male gender was found as a risk factor in terms of transmission which increased the risk 1.633-fold [%95 Cl; (1,048-2,544), p=0,030], working in a laboratory unit increased the risk 2.89-fold [%95 Cl; (1,322-6,316), p=0,008], and contacting out of the hospital increased the risk 7.154-fold [%95 Cl; (4,085-12,529), p <0,001], and all these were determined as independent risk factors.Conclusion: We think that indoor units such as laboratories that do not have direct contact the patient, which seems to be risk-free in terms of transmission, contribute to the cross-contamination of COVID-19 among healthcare workers.

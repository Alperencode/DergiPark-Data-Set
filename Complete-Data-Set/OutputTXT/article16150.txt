Makale Başlığı: Comparison Of Photogrammetric Software Using The Terrestrial Photogrammetric Method: The Case Of Husrev Pasa Mosque
Özet: Looking from the past to the present, very few cultural artifacts have survived to the present day by preserving their own characteristics. Although these artifacts are under protection, they are subject to structural deterioration due to the damages they have suffered as a result of natural events, the damages caused by people and the lack of necessary repairs in accordance with their structural characteristics, and therefore they are demolished. With the terrestrial photogrammetry method, all the details of the structures can be measured in three dimensions and a measurable three-dimensional model of the structure can be obtained with the photographs of the structure. In this study, the detail measurements of Hüsrev Paşa Mosque, which is located in the central İpekyolu district of Van province and which has survived to the present day as the work of Mimar Sinan, were made with the local photogrammetric method in three dimensions and the pictures of the building were taken. Thus, by evaluating the data obtained in the computer environment, it is aimed to obtain a three-dimensional model with all the building details such as the size of each point on the building, the type of building material, and the visual of the building. In the study, comparisons were made using different photogrammetric software. In the data obtained from the study, it was determined that Agisoft metashape software was more successful in terms of sensitivity and Photomodeler UAS software in terms of the number of point clouds obtained and the completion time of the project.

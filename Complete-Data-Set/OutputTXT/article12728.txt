Makale Başlığı: Research on the Reasons of Primary Education Teachers Not Taking Postgraduate Education
Özet: This study aims to find out the reasons why primary school teachers do not prefer doing master’s degree, and to reveal their opinions and suggestions. For this reason, we have examined the following issues in line with the interviews with teachers: Whether they have postgraduate education or not; if so, the reasons for their preference of postgraduate education; if not, the reasons for not preferring the postgraduate education. We have also given place to their opinions on this subject. This is a qualitative case study with randomly selected teachers. A semi-structured interview form based on an expert opinion has been adopted. The interviews have been held with 60 primary school teachers working in Gediz district of Kutahya in the 2019-2020 Academic Year. The analysis of the data obtained from the interviews has been carried out with the content analysis approach. As a result of the interviews, 4 of the 60 teachers participating in the research have taken graduate education and 56 have not. The reasons for their preference of postgraduate education are “academic career” and “professional career”. The reasons why teachers do not prefer postgraduate education are generally stated as “not needing it”, “not having time” , and “not being able to adjust course schedules”. It can be said that the Ministry of National Education should change its strategies and carry out activities that encourage teachers to postgraduate education.

The aim of this literature review is to observe and compare the structural and conceptual changes that have occurred over time to examine the relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this study, international academic studies examining the relationship between corporate governance and financial performance between 2000 and 2019 were reviewed. According to the study findings, the most commonly used financial performance indicators are return on assets and Tobin's Q, and panel data analysis is the most preferred method.

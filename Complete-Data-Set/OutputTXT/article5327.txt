Makale Başlığı: Muslim Qur’ānic Interpretation Today: Media, Genealogies and Interpretive Communities, Johanna Pink (Sheffield: Equinox Publishing, 2019)
Özet: The contemporary tafsir movement, which has experienced significant changes in terms of subjects and sources in the interpretation of the Qur'an, has led many researchers to consider the interpretation of the Qur'an from different perspectives. Although the commentaries written in the modern period include regional and social differences, the contemporary interpretation of the Qur'an in general, unlike the detailed discussions in traditional tafsir texts, basically centers on the Qur'an and its message. However, according to Johanna Pink, such change is not entirely breaking. Based on the theoretical framework, the author acknowledges that this change is part of continuity. In her book, she attempts to determine the period in which change occurs and its effects on the interpretation of the Qur'an. She also discussed the effects of the media in different contexts alongside religious and political authority in the change process. Besides she compared the contemporary tafsir method with the traditional, Salafi, postmodern interpretation methods and revealed how the interpretation of the Qur'an was shaped in the modern period.

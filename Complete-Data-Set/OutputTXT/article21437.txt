Makale Başlığı: Gradient Weyl-Ricci Soliton
Özet: The classical notion of gradient Ricci soliton is extended here to the gradient Weyl-Ricci soliton. A Weyl structureofthebasemanifold M is lifted to its tangent bundle TM, by using the Sasaki metric. We give some necessary and sufficient conditions such that the Weyl structure on TM to be a gradient Weyl-Ricci soliton.

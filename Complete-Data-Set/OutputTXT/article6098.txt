Makale Başlığı: Elliptical Gear Design, Manufacturing, Analysis, and Their Industrial Practises
Özet: The studies covered elliptical gears focus on the design of tooth profiles and the researches increase about prototype manufacturing of elliptical gears. Elliptical gear tooth profile, which is developed based on the fact that the tooth profiles of elliptical gears are not identical to cylindrical gears; It is obtained by shaping tooth flanks with involute curves in accordance with the rolling method on the section ellipse with a rack or cylindrical spur gear cutter. It has been determined that the use of CNC electrical discharge machining (EDM) in the manufacture of elliptical gears has preferably become, also, the manufacturability of elliptical gears in standard modules by developing electronic gearboxes for hobbing machines. Elliptical gear pairs are used into different machines, mechanism and equipments, especially flow meters, and pumps with elliptical gear pairs are seen to be widespread. In today's world, where energy efficiency is of utmost importance, accurate and precise measurement of high fluid amounts and eliminating the losses in the fluid transfer of enterprises are also required. In this review study, the design of elliptical gears, traditional and non-traditional manufacturing methods, strength and vibration analyzes, and various industrial applications in the literature were evoluated and the common result of the literatüre works were obtained. It is predicted that elliptical gears will be an indispensable part of many smart products that contain mechanical parts in the near future.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the W. A. Mozart’s Flute Quartet in D Major K. 285 in terms of Technical Achievements and Form
Özet: In the international flute literature, the works of W. A. Mozart, which perfectly reflect the character of the classical period both technically and musically, are accepted as the building blocks of the period. Mozart has four flute quartets, which are among the chamber music samples, in addition to many works he composed for the flute. In flute education, apart from Mozart's flute concertos, flute quartets have an important place among the works of the classical period. Although flute quartets have remained in the background compared to flute concertos, these works have elements that improve the behaviors desired to be gained in flute education. Therefore, it is important for flute teachers and flute students to introduce and perform these works. In this study, information was given about Mozart's flute quartets, which will be used in flute education, and K.285 in D Major, one of the four quartets, was evaluated in terms of technical gains and form aimed in flute education. The study is important in terms of ensuring that D major quartet, K. 285 is used and promoted in flute education.

Makale Başlığı: Problems and Solutions in 21st Century Turkish-American Relations
Özet: The fact that Turkey started to characterize the United States of America (USA) and the USA as "So-called Strategic Partner" is very important in terms of showing the point reached by the relations of the two countries in the 21st century. The fact that the interests of both sides in Turkey's sphere of influence somehow do not overlap, despite being in the same alliance, causes them to distrust each other and to harden the mutual expressions of the authorities. Despite the many problems between the two countries' relations in the past, the "Strategic Partnership" that both sides have used for each other for years was an invariable expression. However, with the election of Joe Biden to the Presidency of the USA and the word “So-called” used by Anthony Blinken, who was later appointed as the Secretary of State, for Turkey, the strategic partnership gradually turned into the opposite meaning. The partnership, which was formed with the understanding of common enemy and common interest during the cold war, turned into a so-called partnership due to the conflict of interests of the two countries in the changing world order after the cold war. In this article, the issues that caused the relations between Turkey and the USA to be mentioned with the expression "So-called Strategic Partnership" for the first time in history were examined, and the perspectives of both sides on the problems were presented. The fact that both sides see relations as a domestic policy material, their national interests started to clash in the changing world order and mutually uncompromising policies caused the problems to become chronic. It is not in the interests of either country that relations become more and more problematic. Solution proposals regarding the chaotic process of the relations between the two countries for the last 20 years are presented in the conclusion section.

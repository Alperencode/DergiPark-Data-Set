Makale Başlığı: Law and Economics: The Theory, Development and Applications of Economic Analysis of Law
Özet: Every legal rule creates an economic result directly or indirectly. Thus, economics can act as an important bridge between the desired results and practices at th point of ensuring social order through law. With the establishment of this bridge, the effects of economics concepts such as utility maximization, rationality, price theory, efficiency and productivity analysis on the legal realm are investigated. Our study rebeals important findings about why the discipline of law and economics and the economic analysis of law are necessary. While the common conceptual foundations of the disciplines, their historical backgrounds and their place in economics schools are presented, public law and private law fields become the field of determination through the economic analysis of law in the implementation phase. Thus, after the creation of a rule of law, its effects in the society after the application of the rule, the limits at purposes of those who set the rule, and the calculaton of the cost of the sanction as a result of compliance or non-compliance with the rule are among the fields of study of law and economics and economic analysis of law. As a result, with the formation of this common denominator betweeen law and economics, it has been revealed that basic factors such as freedom, justice, welfare and happiness interact positively.

Makale Başlığı: Machinability of CoCrMo Alloy used in Biomedical applications:  Investigation of Cutting Tool Type
Özet: A study was conducted on the machinability of CoCrMo material, which is widely used in the health-care industry as an implant material. When it came to dry machining testing, three separate variables of cutting speed and feed rate were used in conjunction with three different cutting tools (DCMT from two different firms and DCGT inserts). Cutting tools with varied mechanical properties depending on hardness and toughness are available. A machine's output is defined as an average of surface roughness (Ra) and cutting temperature (T), which is calculated as the outcome of experimental study during machining. The outcomes of the tests were evaluated based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S / N) that was obtained. It was decided to apply the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach to determine the influence of factors on Ra and T. In the analysis of variance, the feed rate was the most effective factor on Ra, with a precision ratio of 61.4%, while the cutting speed was the most effective factor on cutting temperature, with a precision ratio of 63.9%. The lowest Ra values were discovered when machining at the fastest possible cutting speed and feed rate, whereas the lowest T values were discovered when machining at the slowest possible cutting speed and feed rate.

Makale Başlığı: Antimicrobial and Anticancer Activity of Corydalis solida
Özet: Aim: The present study, it was aimed to evaluate the bioactive properties of Corydalis solida.Material and Methods: In the study, the anticancer activity of ethanolic extracts prepared from C. solida was determined on HCT116 colon cancer, AGS gastric cancer and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and HUVEC cells, healthy control cell line. Well diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial properties of solida. For this purpose, ethanolic extracts were used for antimicrobial activity against four bacterial isolates (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca) and three yeast strains (Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C .glabrata).Results: Corydalis solida plant extract produced significant antiproliferative effect in HCT116 (colon cancer), AGS (gastric cancer) and HepG2 (liver cancer) cell lines. This effect was more remarkable in the HepG2 cell line. In addition, negligible cell death in HUVEC cells indicated that the plant was not toxic to healthy cells. Plant extract application also caused significant Caspase-3, 8 and 9 activation in HepG2 and HCT116 cells, consistent with the antiproliferative effect. Antimicrobial studies have shown that the extract made inhibition zone on bacteria.Conclusion: In the study, it was determined that the ethanol extract of Corydalis solida had anticancer effect. In addition, the extract had inhibitory properties on bacteria.  The data obtained from the study are qualified to support further pharmacological studies.

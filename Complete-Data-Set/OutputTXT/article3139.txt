Makale Başlığı: A Rare Case of Scalp Mass: Clear Cell Hidradenocarcinoma
Özet: Clear cell hydroadenocarcinoma is a very rare sweat gland tumor. It has an aggressive course and has a high recurrence rate. Wide excision is the first option in the treatment of this tumor with a high rate of metastasis. Subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy are still controversial. In this case, we presented a patient who was operated on and presented with a lipoma-like appearance on the scalp. The pathology result of the patient was Clear cell hidradenocarcinoma. We emphasized that in operations performed with the preliminary diagnosis of lipoma on the scalp, this diagnosis should be included among the preliminary diagnoses and resection should be performed as widely as possible.

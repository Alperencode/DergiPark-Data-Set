Makale Başlığı: THE LIABILITY OF THE LATEST TRANSFEREE FROM THE OUTSTANDING SOCIAL SECURITY PREMIUM DEBT OF THE THE FIRST TRANSFEROR WHEN THE WORKPLACE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED MORE THAN ONCE
Özet: According to the Social Insurance and General Health Insurance Act no 5510 article 89 subsection 1 (as amended by Act no 5754), the transferee shall be liable from the transferor’s debts against the Social Security Institution. However, the article does not regulate the liability of the latest transferee from the first transferor’s debts if the workplace has been transferred more than once. This problem is discussed in decisions of the Court of Cassation and literature. Until 2018, according to the Court of Cassation’s majority decision, the latest transferee is not liable from the first transferor’s social security premium debts; but the transfer is fraudulent. This jurisprudence became the prevalent opinion among legal scholars. However, in 2018 the Court of Cassation changed its position and accepted the dissent opinion which states that the latest transferee shall be liable from the first transferor’s debts to Social Security Institution if the workplace has been transferred more than once. In this study, the case law and the doctrine regarding the problem are analyzed in the light of the labor and commercial law. To this end, firstly the legal definition and consequences of transfer of the workplace are explained under the labor and commercial law. Then, the rationale of the case-law of the Court of Cassation before and after 2018 is examined and discussed whether the rationale and the consequences of the decisions are in line with the regulation of the structural changes in the corporate law.

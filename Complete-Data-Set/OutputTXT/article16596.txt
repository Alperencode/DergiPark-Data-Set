Makale Başlığı: Democratic Governance and Human Rights Violations in Nigeria’s Fourth Republic: It’s Implication on International Human Rights Law
Özet: Democracy has become permanent in Nigeria in 1999 when the last military dispensation of General Abdulsalami Abubakar handed over power to a democratically elected government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. However, despite its entrenchment and consolidation, it faces many challenges like human rights violations. In this context, this article aims to examine the paradox of democratic governance and the challenges of human rights violations in Nigeria’s fourth republic, and how it impacted the principle of international human rights law. Using qualitative research methodology through an extensive desk review of several extant studies, the findings of the study suggest that despite the non-interruption of the democratic and civil space in Nigeria, entrenching true democratic ideals and their tenets in Nigeria remains problematic this is due to the prevalence of human rights violations across various sectors of the Nigerian polity. It further revealed that the inability of international actors like the United Nations in checkmating and sanctioning acts of human rights abuse by the Nigerian authority negatively affects the strengthening of democratic governance and its ideals within the Nigerian state. This study, therefore, addresses these challenges to strengthen and deepen democratic governance in Nigeria, suggesting that appropriate agencies and actors at the global, regional, and national levels should ensure that the rights and privileges of all Nigerians are not only respected but also protected as expressly stated in the constitution.

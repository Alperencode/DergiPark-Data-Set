Makale Başlığı: PERIODS OF TALIBAN POWER IN AFGHANISTAN (1996-2001 and 2021 to PRESENT) AFGHANISTAN FOREIGN POLICY
Özet: Afghanistan has always been an area of interest for great powers and regional actors in terms of its strategic location. The history of Afghanistan includes processes such as “occupation, civil war and political instability” where periods of conflict and turmoil are frequent. With the “civil war” that started after the Soviet Union's (SSRU) invasion of Afghanistan and the influence of external factors, the Taliban organization emerged in 1994, dominated almost the whole country in a short time and lost power in 2001 with the US intervention in Afghanistan. The Taliban organization, which regained its power in Afghanistan after 2001, started a struggle with the USA and its allies after a short period of “withdrawal”. The Taliban organization came to power again in Afghanistan in 2021, after twenty years of struggle between the US and NATO forces. In this study, the power periods of the Taliban organization in Afghanistan after 1996-2001 and 2021 are examined. The aim of this study is to analyze the foreign policy of the Taliban organization. The main hypothesis of this article is the argument that “the main reason for the emergence of the Taliban organization, taking over the country in a short time and not losing its effectiveness in Afghanistan for the last two decades is not only external factors, but also the political instability in the country and the authority vacuum created by the power struggle”. In this respect, it will be examined whether the foreign policy approach of the Taliban government has changed compared to the previous period, and it will be questioned whether the policies of the states that did not formally recognize the Taliban organization and remained distant in the new period after 2021 have changed.

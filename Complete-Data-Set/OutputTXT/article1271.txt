Makale Başlığı: Survival Rate of Young Pear Trees in Different Rootstock and Cultivar Combinations under Field Conditions: Preliminary Results
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the effects of 7 different rootstocks on rootstock diameter (mm), stem diameter (mm), and plant survival ratio (%) of some pear cultivars between 2019-2021. Rootstocks, cultivars, research years, and their interactions significantly affected all examined parameters in the study, except for the interaction of year x rootstock x cultivar. The ‘Deveci’/BA29 and ‘Deveci’/OHxF333 had the largest rootstock and trunk diameters, while the 'Williams'/MC had the smallest. The Fox11 and OHxF333 rootstocks had the highest plant survival ratios, whereas the MC rootstocks had the lowest. In terms of cultivar, the maximum plant survival ratio was found in the ‘Deveci’. At the end of the first 3 years after planting, there was a decrease in the survival ratio of the plants. ‘Williams’ had the lowest rootstock diameter, trunk diameter and survival ratio. The highest trunk diameter was in the OHxF333, BA29, Fox11 and Farold40 rootstocks, and the cultivar was in the ‘Deveci’. Plant survival ratios in quince clonal rootstocks were slightly lower than in pear rootstocks. This is due to the graft incompatibility between quince rootstocks and some pear cultivars. Compatible inter-stock with rootstock and cultivar should be employed to overcome this incompatibility problem caused by localized graft incompatibility. According to the findings of this study on young plants, it is required to extend the research and conduct additional observations in order to give more precise recommendations.

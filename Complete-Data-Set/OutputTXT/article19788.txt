Makale Başlığı: “Thinking about thinking on the moral one”: a model on the relationships between mindfulness, metacognition, and moral metacognition
Özet: The distinguishing feature of human is his/her cognitive capacity. With this cognitive capacity, people established civilizations and developed moral systems. Awareness is central to these cognitive traits. People who are aware of themselves and their environment can know, monitor, and regulate their thoughts. This study addresses these cognitive features in a moral context. In this direction, a model has been proposed regarding the mediating role of metacognition between mindfulness and moral metacognition. The participants of the study consist of 220 people, most of whom are university students. The scales and questions of the research were delivered to the participants online. The findings obtained from the testing of the model indicate that mindfulness contributes to moral metacognition with mediation of metacognition. However, there is no direct relationship between mindfulness and moral metacognition. The findings were discussed in terms of the contribution of the study to the literature, its limitations, and implications for future studies.

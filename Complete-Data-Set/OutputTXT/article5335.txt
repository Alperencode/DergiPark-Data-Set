Makale Başlığı: INTERACTION OF BARIUM AND MAGNESIUM CONTAINING SOLIDS WITH CARBONATE LOADED SOLUTIONS
Özet: In this study, the interaction of barium (Ba(OH)2·8H2O and BaSO4) or magnesium (Mg(OH)2 and MgSO4·7H2O) containing solids with dissolved carbonate-loaded solutions formed after leaching of a local smithsonite (ZnCO3) ore sample in aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions was investigated using X-ray diffraction analyses for the removal of dissolved carbonate (as BaCO3 or MgCO3) in these loaded solutions. It has been observed that solids containing BaCO3 as a single phase and Mg(OH)2 as a main phase are formed, respectively, following the interaction of dissolved carbonate-loaded solutions with Ba(OH)2·8H2O and MgSO4·7H2O solids. On the other hand, it was determined that BaSO4 and Mg(OH)2 solids did not interact with the carbonate-loaded solutions and remained unconverted. However, no conversion to barium or magnesium zincate phases was also found under all studied experimental conditions. Within this study, the conversion properties of alkaline-earth barium and magnesium-containing solids to their corresponding carbonate phases after interacting with dissolved carbonate-loaded solutions were discussed considering the solubilities of these solids. In addition, infrared spectra and scanning electron microscope images of some converted solids obtained after selected experiments were also presented within the scope of this study.

Makale Başlığı: A Comparison of the Complaint Cases Related to Heritage in Sivas Ahkâm Registers with Numbers of 8 and 15
Özet: Heritage is a phenomenon that human beings transfer assets in a balance of life death and reaccepted as legitimate by all societies on earth. Therefore, every nation has regulated the law of inheritance sometimes according to their religious beliefs and sometimes according to the legal principles of the age. The Ottoman Empire has also set rules within the framework of İslamic and Turkish inheritance law. However, as it can be in any subject, there have been problems with inheritance, sometimes caused by the family and sometimes externally. In this study, the complaint provisions regarding the inheritance registered in Sivas Ahkâm Registers No. 8 and 15 were examined. The between 8 register contains 1760-1761 and the number 15 register contains the provisions regarding the complaints reflected in the Divan-ı Hümayun from the province of Sivas between 1780-1781. In the Sivas Ahkâm Registers no. 8 and 15, a total of 129 complaint decisions related to inheritance were determined. These provisions were first transcribed, then summarized and then the cases were categorized and interpreted. Basically, an answer was sought for the questions of “for what reason did the problems in the heritage occur and what solutions were produced?” and “whether there was a dramatic increase in the number of cases related to the inheritance”. In the light of the obtained results, answers to the questions we have mentioned above were sought and the answers reached were discussed.

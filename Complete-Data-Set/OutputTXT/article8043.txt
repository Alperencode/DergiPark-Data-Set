Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of Women's Right to the City in the Context of Gender
Özet: The right to the city refers to the equal and effective use and participation of all individuals in urban space. However, in terms of gender, the city has a masculine structure. Within this structure, women cannot exist equally in the city due to gender-based inequalities. It is necessary to consider the city sociologically in a gender context. This research aims to evaluate women's right to the city from a gender perspective. Gender and the right to the city are the two basic concepts of the study. Based on the literature review on two concepts, the participation of women in urban spaces are discussed. As a result, it can be said that gender inequality reflecting power relations exists in cities as an economic, social, and cultural space, and although women are more involved in the public sphere, they use their city rights in a limited way due to the sexist nature of the public-private space distinction and security problems in the masculine-dominant city. In this context, urban planning and the practices of local governments on a legal basis are of great importance in terms of establishing not only women's rights but also human rights by ensuring gender equality in cities.

Makale Başlığı: Development and Validation of New RP-HPLC Method for Estimation of Pramipexole Dihydrochloride in Bulk and Pharmaceutical Formulation
Özet: A novel high-performance liquid chromatographic assay method was developed and validated for the quantitative determination of the anti-Parkinson agent pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate in bulk and its tablet dosage form. In this perspective, the chromatographic separation was accomplished on Eclipse XDB-12 C18 (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size) column using UV detection at 263 nm. The mobile phase consisted of distilled water: acetonitrile (10: 90 v/v), run at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with isocratic elution. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines by evaluating the system suitability, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ), precision, accuracy, specificity, selectivity and short-term stability. Our findings revealed that retention time for pramipexole dihydrochloride was found to be 5.2 minutes. The linearity range was established between 6.25-225.0 μg/mL with a mean recovery of 101.26 % ± 0.56. The limits of detection and quantification were determined to be 4.18 μg/mL and 12.66 μg/mL, respectively, indicating that the method is very sensitive. Intra and inter-day precision were within acceptable limits (RSD<2, n=6) and the typical excipients included in the pharmaceutical product did not interfere with the selectivity of the method. The proposed method was found to be simple, specific, accurate, precise and could be applied to the quantitative analysis of pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate in a bulk and in a its tablet dosage form.

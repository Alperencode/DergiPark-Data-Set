Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES ON THE CONCEPT OF HAPPINESS AT THE WORKPLACE WITH BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS
Özet: The concept of happiness at work is the positive emotions that the employee develops at work. Studies have shown that employees who are happy at work perform better, are more productive, and experience less burnout. In the organizational literature, it is known that concepts such as job satisfaction, subject well-being, work passion and emotional commitment are studied instead of the concept of happiness, which is not studied much. In this study, it is aimed to determine the bibliometric features of the studies conducted in the field of social and human sciences on the concept of happiness at work. Studies on the concept of happiness at work were accessed from the Scopus database and analyzed with the Biblioshiny interface in the RStudio editor within the R programming language. In the study, articles written in English after 1980 on workplace happiness were examined. Between 1980 and 2021, 808 articles from 556 journals were accessed, and the data obtained were visualized and interpreted in the context of author, journal, citation, country and collaborations through bibliometric mapping analyzes. Thus, gaps related to the concept were identified and it was thought that it could guide future researchers.

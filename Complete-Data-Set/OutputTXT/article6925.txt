Makale Başlığı: Assessment of the Effects of Quercetin on Lung Injury After  Hind Limb Ischemia Reperfusion in Rats
Özet: Background: Quercetin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Although there are previous animal experi-ments investigating Quercetin’s effect on ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury in the literature, studies involving effect of lower extremity IR on remote organ are rare.Materials and Methods: 18 male Wistar Albino rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, 6 in each group as; Cont-rol (C), Ischemia-reperfusion (IR), IR-Quercetin, (IR-Q). Their weights were between 200-250 g. 30 minutes before the procedure20 mg/kgQuercetin was administered via intraperitoneal route. In the IR groups, infrarenal abdomi-nal aorta was clamped by an atraumatic microvascular clamp. After 120 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion was achieved for another 120 minutes. When reperfusion period ended, tissue samples were taken from the lungs. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activity and histopathological parameters were compared.Results: We found the MDA level in the IR group higher than the control group (p<0.0001). Lower MDA level was found in the IR-Q group compared tothe IR group (p=0.012). SOD and CAT enzyme activity in the IR group was notably lower in the control group (p<0.0001, p<0.001, respectively). Higher SOD and CAT enzyme activities were found in the IR-Q group compared to the IR group (p=0.012, p<0.001, respectively). Neutrophil infiltra-tion/aggregation, alveolar wall thickness and total lung injury score were notably higher in IR group than in C group (p=0.001, p=0.002, p<0.0001, respectively). In addition, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the Quercetin treated group in neutrophil infiltration/aggregation, alveolar wall thickness and total lung injury score compared to the IR group (p=0.023, p=0.022, p=0.002, respectively).Conclusions: We determined that intraperitoneally administered Quercetin at a dose of 20 mg/kg30 minutes before ischemia in rats reduces lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and reduces the damage caused by IR in lung histo-pathology.Study findings suggest that Quercetin has a lung protective effect when administered before IR.

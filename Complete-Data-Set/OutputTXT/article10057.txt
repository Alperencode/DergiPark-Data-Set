Makale Başlığı: Nursing Education and Zoom Fatigue in the Pandemic Process
Özet: AbstractIn our country the distance learning process was started by taking a break from face-to-face training at universities after the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. At the same time, these possibilities also bring some problems. Simultaneous classroom sessions often turn into long lessons, which can lead to multitasking and distraction. Depending on individual life (home and work life, residence area), it may be difficult for them to attend classes. Because of these factors, people feel frustrated, exhausted, and tired, resulting in the term “Zoom Fatigue”. Nursing students who are prospective health professionals of the future have experienced zoom fatigue in the COVID-19 pandemic and some biopsychosocial problems caused by stress in the distance education process, their lives have been affected both positively and negatively in this process, and students’ taking only theoretical knowledge without clinical practice has caused them to forget the issues quickly. Due to these problems, it has been determined that some negative thoughts about the nursing profession have occurred. The fact that students do not get answers at the desired level think that they are deficient in expressing themselves and quickly forget the lessons taught shows that distance education has disadvantages and hinders personal and professional development for students. In order to reduce the devastating and wearisome psychological effects of the pandemic, students should be informed about the correct use of online courses and possible problems, creating opportunities for them to express their feelings clearly, and supporting them to consult mental health professionals when necessary; It is recommended that they interact with professional societies or associations that can increase their professional knowledge and competencies and contribute to their development.

Makale Başlığı: İstanbul Park Hotel (1930 - 1979)
Özet: The contribution of former hotel enterprises is evident in the analysis of lodging industry development in Turkey. One of those hotels is Park Hotel, which was first established in 1930 under the name Mirimare in the first years of Republic. This study aims to examine the history of that institution, which played a critical role to overcome the obstacles and achieve success through remarkable services and implementations representing the development of the lodging industry in Turkey. As a conclusion of this conceptual research based on literature review, Park Hotel appears to have a great contribution as a pioneer property not only for hospitality, restaurant, bar and patisserie services but also as a school for young Turkish citizens to introduce restaurant waiting and hotel management as emerging occupations.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Chemistry Questions in the Higher Education Institutions Examination according to the 2018 Chemistry Curriculum Acquisitions
Özet: In this study, the chemistry test questions in the Basic Proficiency Test (TYT) and Field Qualification Tests (AYT) in the 2019-2021 years were analyzed in terms of the acquisitions of the 2018 Secondary School Chemistry Curriculum and the content validity was evaluated in terms of subject dimension. Within the scope of the study, a total of 60 questions were analyzed, 21 of which were TYT and 39 were AYT. At the end of the study, it was determined that TYT chemistry test questions were mostly prepared from 9th and 10th-grade acquisitions, while AYT chemistry test questions were mostly prepared from 11th and 12th-grade acquisitions. It is seen that the TYT-2019 chemistry test questions cover 11.8% of the 2018 Secondary School Chemistry Curriculum total acquisitions, and the TYT-2020 and TYT-2021 chemistry test questions cover 13.4% and 8.7% of all the program's acquisitions, respectively. It was determined that AYT-2019, AYT-2020 and AYT-2021 chemistry test questions were prepared from 22.0%, 18.1% and 17.3% of the total acquisitions of the 2018 Chemistry Curriculum, respectively. In addition, from the acquisitions of the "Nature and Chemistry" and "Energy Resources and Scientific Developments" units, it was concluded that there were no questions in the chemistry tests of all YKS exams between the 2019-2021 years. It has been determined that the unit in which questions are prepared from the most acquisitions of the AYT-2019 and AYT-2020 exams in the chemistry tests is "Equilibrium in Chemical Reactions".

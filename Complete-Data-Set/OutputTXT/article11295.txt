Özet: It is often overlooked that Richard W. Bulliet, who gifted the field of Islamic history with unique and important works with his extraordinary outlook, is also a novelist. Bulliet's first novel is a mystery novel published in 1973, entitled Kicked to Death by a Camel. While not considered a perfect novel by critics, works of fiction like this reveal one aspect of Bulliet's success in his scholarly work. After all, whether or not he writes a novel or a short story, having the ability to make a good fiction from what he has compiled, having a strong imagination and being able to complete the pieces of the puzzle in his mind are indispensable qualities of a good historian.Although there are many poets among those who continue their scientific studies in the field of theology in our country, those who write novels and short stories are not many. Muhammed Enes Topgül, with his last book, Râvi: A Muhaddis's Journey of Science in the Second Century of Hijri, joins these few writers.

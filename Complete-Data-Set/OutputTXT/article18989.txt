Makale Başlığı: The Use of Online Questionnaires in Scientific Research: Opinions, Preferences and Concerns of Academicians
Özet: The use of online questionnaires has increased in research due to the spread of internet use and recent COVID-19 pandemic. Online questionnaires provide advantages in terms of cost, speed, and convenience. However, there are some limitations of the method that may reduce the data quality. Although online questionnaires are quite common in Turkey, there is almost no research on this method in the national literature. The primary purpose of this research is to summarize the current information in the literature on the advantages and disadvantages of the method and to explore the current situation regarding the use of the method in Turkey. In this context an exploratory research was designed to investigate Turkish academicians' opinions, preferences, and concerns, who used the online questionnaires. An online survey was run with 211 academicians working in different departments of 80 universities located in 50 cities from Turkey's seven distinct geographical regions, and findings are discussed.

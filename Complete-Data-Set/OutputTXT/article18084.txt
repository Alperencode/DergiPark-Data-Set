Makale Başlığı: Chemical Castration  Medical Orchiectomy
Özet: The importance of applying chemical castration as a legal sanction in our country, which is one of the treatment options for sex offenders and applied in different parts of the world, has increased. Drugs which are used ın chemical castration  cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone  lhrh /gonadotropin-releasing hormone  GnRH  analogues  significantly reduce the recidivism by preventing the appearance of deviant sexual behavior. The antilibidinal effects of these drugs which have different efficacy and side effect profile are reversible. The main feature which separates chemical castration from surgical castration is that the effects are reversible. Although there is no consensus on duration of sex offenders’ treatment, it is stated that at least three years are necessary. For some patients a life-long treatment may be needed. Chemical castration reduces recidivism during treatment, but it is not only enough to administer this treatment alone, but it also must be combined with psychotherapy

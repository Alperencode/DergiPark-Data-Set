Makale Başlığı: Digital Transformation of CPR Mannequins in Medical Education with Artificial Intelligence Classifier
Özet: Medical education, including the management of simulation centers, has become another important area in the Industry 4.0 phenomenon in terms of digital transformation. In this study, data obtained by messaging a mechanical CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) first aid training manikin with modularly developed electronic devices were collected. These data are also processed through the developed software that enables them to communicate with both mobile devices and desktop computers, and the validity of the massage activity performed with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm is verified. The modular kit was developed in the Open Source Laboratory of the Department of Informatics (KOUOSL) with the support of the Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine and the Department of Emergency Medicine. An ideal CPR massage interval is expressed as 100-120 compressions per minute and application to the chest at a depth of approximately 5-6 cm. In order to determine the validity and accuracy of the CPR in the study, based on the data collected from the sensors placed on the mannequin, feedback was given to the Observer Trainer whether an ideal massage was performed with an AI classifier. Thus, a more effective practical training application will be developed and provided by digitizing the mechanical mannequin.

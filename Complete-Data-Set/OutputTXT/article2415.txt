Within this scope in this study, it is aimed to draw the framework of STEAM Integrated Learning Model and to reveal its place in current teaching methodologies and its importance in skill development. For this purpose, the compilation has been based on the studies with current and concrete outcomes, in which STEAM integrated learning model is used, the Art(A) element is integrated into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields.  In the results presented in the light of this review; based on the interdisciplinary conceptual STEAM Integrated Learning Model, it has been revealed that the learning model supports the development of integrated skills and therefore talents in integration of different disciplines with versatile connections, making individuals more creative in problem solving and product design. In this context, it is recommended that STEAM Integrated Leaning Model be the subject of more researches on the basis of the results obtained so far and to be used appropriately and meaningfully in current teaching practices based on skill and talent development.

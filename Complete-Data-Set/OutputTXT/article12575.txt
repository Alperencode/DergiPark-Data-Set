Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Body Fat Tissue Distribution in Obese and Premenopausal Patients Complicated with Endometrial Hyperplasia
Özet: Objective: There is a close association between obesity and menstrual irregularity. This study aims to investigate lipoid tissue accumulation between overweight or obese premenopausal patients with endometrial hyperplasia and with benign pathologic lesions via using the bioimpedance method.Materials and Methods: Obese or overweight volunteers with abnormal uterine bleeding were examined. Eighty-eight volunteers meet the inclusion criteria. We obtained fat mass, fat percentage and impedance of body parts by using Multi-Frequency Body Composition Analyzer. Blood lipid profile and ultrasonographic measurement of endometrial thickness were also performed. Results: 33 volunteers were in the hyperplasia group and 55 were in the control group. 28 of the 33 volunteers (84.8%) had at least one increased fatty acid. 41 of the 55 patients (74.5%) had at least one increased fatty acid in the control group. Total cholesterol levels are higher in the hyperplasia group than in the control group (p=0.006). There was no significant difference between the groups for bioimpedance analyses. Conclusion: Hyperlipidemia remains an important factor that contributes to endometrial pathologies. Serum cholesterols were significantly high in the endometrial hyperplasia group. Rather than lipoid tissue distribution, increased cholesterol may contribute to gynecologic pathology occurrence in obese individuals complicated with endometrial hyperplasia.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of The Efficiency Of Alpha-Terpineol in the In Vitro Lipopolisacharide Stimulated Liver Inflammation Model
Özet: Terpinols are monoterpene compounds, and biological effects like anticancer, anticonvulsant and antiulcer have been demonstrated in many studies due to their antioxidant properties. The aim of the research was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic biofunctions of α-terpineol in LPS induced inflammation model of liver cells. HepG2 (ATCC® HB-8065) cells of human origin were selected as material. LPS and α-terpineol were applied to cells at different concentrations for 24 hours, and their effective concentrations were determined by cell viability tests (MTT). Afterwards, gene expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, Caspase 3, Bax and Bcl-2 were investigated by qRT-PCR method. LPS at 50 ng/ml, caused 11.5% cell loss and was chosen for modeling. However, α-terpineol at 10 μM concentration prevented 2.12% of cell loss. In the study, LPS increased TNF-α and IL-1β gene expressions, and α-terpineol application reversed this situation. Again, while IL-10 was suppressed by high LPS concentration, it was significantly stimulated by α-terpineol. Besides, LPS increased caspase 3 and Bax gene expressions, but α-terpineol suppressed this stimulation. Bcl-2 gene expressions were suppressed by LPS and stimulated by α-terpineol. In summary, short-term and low proliferative concentration of α-terpineol can be an alternative treatment agent, especially in pathogen-induced liver disorders.

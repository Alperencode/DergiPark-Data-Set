Th e archaeological records of theAndalusian Umayyad State, which was established in the Iberian Peninsula as a continuationof the Umayyad dynasty who could not survive in Syria not only sheds light on the fl amboyantIslamic history in this region, but also reveals the eff ective role of the diplomacy channel andthe caliphate position in this diplomacy of its period. Abd al-Rahman III, the fi rst caliph of theIberian Peninsula (891-961), after years of Islamic domination in Andalusia, stabilized his powerpolitically and militarily in the Iberian Peninsula. He was recognized for his strong managementand successful initiatives in international relations. Abd al-Rahman III transformed the emirateof Andalusia into a caliphate, he became the fi rst administrative to receive the title of the caliphin Andalusia. With its half-century domination, he left very important cultural and politicalfootprints in the Iberian Peninsula. As a Caliphal construction of Abd al-Rahman III, the cityof Medina’al Zahra in Córdoba was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2018. Inthis study, how caliphal image was created will be investigated through archeological evidencesin Andalusia.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of fur morphology characteristics of the genus Mus Linnaeus 1758 (Mammalia: Rodentia)
Özet: In studies with rodents, it is very important to define the fur characteristics, since the first striking features are their external morphological characters, that is their fur. A total of 562 Mus specimens from 40 localities in western Turkey were evaluated by looking at their fur morphology. It was observed that the dorsal part of the fur varies from dark brown to dark gray, while the ventral part varies from light brown to dark gray in the examined Mus domesticus specimens. It has been determined that the junctions of the dorsal and ventral parts of the fur are not separated by a clear line. It was determined that the tail was monochromatic and the ears were covered with dorsal colored hairs. In the examined Mus macedonicus specimens, it was determined that the dorsal fur color ranged from gray to brown tones. It has been determined that the ventral fur color varies from white to light gray and yellowish tones, and the dorsal and ventral fur color is clearly separated from each other. When viewed from the dorsal, the tail was dark brown, when viewed from the ventral, it was lighter in color according to dorsal fur and it was observed that the ears were covered with hairs.

Makale Başlığı: THE PHYTOPLANKTON ECOLOGY OF ÜZÜMCÜ STREAM (BALIKESİR)
Özet: Algae are of great importance in determining the water quality of streams and stagnant water sources. In order to examine the phytoplankton ecology of the Üzümcü Stream, sampling was carried out at 2 stations in the spring (April), summer (June) and autumn (October) 2020 periods. In this study, a total of 47 planktonic algal species were identified, 28 from the Bacillariophyta group, 11 from the Chlorophyta group, 6 from the Cyanobacteria group and 2 from the Euglenophyta group. Bacillariophyta group constituted 59%, Chlorophyta group 23%, Cyanobacteria group 12% and Euglenophyta group 4% of planktonic algal species. In Üzümcü Stream, Aulacoseira granulata (Ehrenberg) Simonsen, Cymbella affinis Kütz., Nitzschia sigmoidea (Nitzsch) W. Smith and Pinnularia major (Kützing) Rabenh from the Bacillariophyta group, Scenedesmus quadricauda (Turpin) Brab. Hansgirg and Pediastrum simplex Meyen Lemm., Oscillatoria subtilissima Kützing from the Cyanobacteria group, and Trachelomonas hispida (Perty) from the Euglenophta group were predominantly detected. CCA showed that the diatoms,  A.granulata correlated with NO3, C. affinis with TP, N. sigmoidea and P. major with TN and PO4. The green algae, S. quadricauda, T. minimum and P. simplex were correlated with pH. The cyabobacterium, O. subtilissima and Euglenophta, T. hispida were correlated with dissolved oxygen. Water temperature ranged from 13°C to 24°C, dissolved oxygen from 3.35 mgl-1 to 8.1 mgl-1, pH from 6.85 to 7.94, electrical conductivity from 1456 μScm-1 to 1661 μScm-1, nitrate nitrogen (NO3) from 0.45 mgl-1 to 0.87 mgl-1, total nitrogen (TN) from mgl-1 1.91 to 5.95 mgl-1, phosphate (PO4) from 0.07 mgl-1 to 0.09 mgl-1 and total phosphorus (TP) from 0.07 mgl-1 to 0.18 mgl-1. When the measured values are evaluated in the light of the Water Pollution Control Regulation criteria, Üzümcü Stream had the IV. class water quality. The dominant planktonic algal species detected in Üzümcü Stream are mostly distributed in water bodies with eutrophic character. Therefore, Üzümcü Stream is an eutrophic stream based on biological water quality elements. For the protection of Üzümcü Stream, priority should be given to ecological agriculture, especially around the Üzümcü Stream, and it is recommended that the domestic and industrial waste water be thoroughly treated before discharged to the stream.

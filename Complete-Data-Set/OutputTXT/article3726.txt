Makale Başlığı: Depression and Quality of Life Related Factors in Hemodialysis Patients
Özet: Objective: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder affecting patients on hemodialysis (HD) and has been associated with impaired Quality of Life (QoL). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depression and the relationship between depression, QoL, and demographic factors in HD patients.Methods: Short form 36 (SF–36) and Beck's depression inventory (BDI) were employed to assess the relationship between depression, QoL and demographics in 50 hemodialysis patients. The relationship between scores of BDI and SF–36, and annual biochemical and demographic data were then evaluated.Results: Mean age of the patients was 56.4 ±16.4 years and the mean HD duration was 57.11 ±39.09 months. The incidence of depression (BDI>14) was 36%. Age, hemoglobin, ferritin, body mass index (BMI), and Kt/V values were observed to be significantly correlated with the QoL scores (p<0.05 for all). These scores, however, were not related to dialysis duration, serum albumin, CRP, calcium, phosphorus, and parathormone values. The target level for hemoglobin, age <45 years, and ideal body weight were associated with high SF–36 social functioning score (p<0.05).Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the depressive symptoms were as high as 36% among the study group linked to poor QoL. Interestingly, annual mean values of Kt/V and the biochemical parameters were not related to BDI scores. Higher levels of ferritin (800) (negatively) and hemoglobin (>11 g/dL) / ideal BMI (18–25 kg/m2) / younger age (18–45 year) (positively) were related to some SF–36 scores. The study emphasizes that hemodialysis patients should also be evaluated for depression and QoL, to optimize clinical outcomes with the help of nephrologists and psychiatrist.

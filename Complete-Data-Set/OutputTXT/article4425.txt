Makale Başlığı: The Relationshiıp Between Organizational Commitment and Job Satisfaction: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Study from the Perspective of Healthcare Workers in Turkey
Özet: This comprehensive meta-analysis study presents a summary of domestic publications based on the relationship between job satisfaction and the organizational commitment of healthcare professionals. The data of the study were collected in January 2022. The population of the research consisted of master's and doctoral theses, which were scanned on the National Thesis Center, and articles indexed by DergiPark Academic and TR Index. As a result of the screenings and in accordance with the inclusion criteria, it was decided a total of 46 studies that were suitable for analysis. As a result of the analyses carried out using the comprehensive meta-analysis program, it was revealed that the general z and p test values of the randomized impact size between the job satisfaction and organizational commitment of the health sector workers were significant, positive, and moderate. It was concluded that the lower limits of the confidence intervals of the 2 studies examined within the scope of the research were lower than the other studies. Before deciding on the appropriate impact size model, necessary heterogeneity tests were performed, and it was determined that the research data were not homogeneously distributed as a result of the Chi-square test result of the Cochran's Q test and Higgins' I2 test statistics, considering the forest graph results. Publication bias tests performed within the scope of the study indicate that there is no publication bias in the study and the results obtained are reliable. It is considered that the findings obtained will guide future studies and will provide evidence-based information for health managers and policymakers.

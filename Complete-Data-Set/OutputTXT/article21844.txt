Makale Başlığı: MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF OLIVE PIT POWDER ADDED POLYPROPYLENE COMPOSITE
Özet: In this study, powdered olive pits were added to polypropylene at a rate of 5-10-15 and 20% by weight, and four different polymer composite materials with olive pits were produced by twin screw extruder. 5% maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-g-PP) was added to the composite to increase the compatibility of polypropylene and olive pits. Later, the granular composite material was molded by injection molding method and standard test samples were molded. In order to learn about the mechanical properties of the composite, elasticity modulus, yield strength, tensile strength, % elongation, hardness, Izod impact strength and density tests were performed. In addition, in order to see the distribution of olive pit powders in the matrix, photographs of the broken surface were taken with scanning electron microscopy. According to the results of the tests, with the increase of olive pits powder ratios in the matrix; It was determined that the elasticity modulus, hardness and density values increased while the yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and impact strength values decreased.

Makale Başlığı: Survey of  COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and  Investigating Reasons for Vaccine Refusal Among Healthcare Professionals
Özet: Objective: Although there are many vaccine developments, vaccine side-effect studies globally, limited literature information on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy/refusal. In our study, we aimed to investigate the factors for COVID-19 vaccine refusal of healthcare professionals (HCPs). Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to HCPs employed who were not vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine during the study period at two pandemic hospitals.Results: A total of 74 who were not vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine HCPs participated in the survey. A large majority of respondents were female (n=49,66.2%) and nurses (n=35,47.3%), and the average age of HCPs was 32.2 ± 7.8. 55.4 % of HCPs were not vaccinated against COVID-19, and 44.6 % of HCPs were one dose COVID-19 vaccinated. 50% of HCPs were confused about the COVID-19 vaccine. 63.5% of HCPs were not vaccinated as they were waiting for a different form of the current vaccine. 58.1% of HCPs believe that the vaccine doesn't effective as vaccinated people became infected. Conclusion: Measures should be taken to increase the COVID-19 immunization rates of HCPs. The level of knowledge of HCPs about COVID-19 vaccines should be increased. If possible, the opportunity to be vaccinated with different forms of COVID-19 vaccines should be given.

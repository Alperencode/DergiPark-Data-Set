Makale Başlığı: An Investigation on the Effect of STEM Practices on Sixth-Grade Students’ Problem-Solving Skills, Critical Thinking, and Attitudes Toward STEM
Özet: This study examines the effects of STEM practices integrated with the 5E learning model in sixth grades of middle schools on students’ problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and attitudes toward STEM. In the study, one group pretest-posttest experimental design is applied. The study sample consists of 20 students enrolled in the sixth grade of a public school in the 2020-2021 academic year. The application lasted for five weeks and took place in two phases. In the first week of the first phase, students were taught the LEGO Education Spike Prime Set and coding. In the second stage of the application, the students did four different activities in groups for four weeks, namely Super Cleanup, Break Dance, Hoppers Race, and Broken CNC Machine. Problem-Solving Inventory, Critical Thinking Disposition Scale, and STEM Attitude Scale were used as data collection tools in the research. The data obtained in the study indicated that STEM practices integrated with the 5E learning model contributed positively to students' critical thinking skills and attitudes toward STEM. At the same time, they did not cause a significant difference in students' problem-solving skills, but there was an increase in their problem-solving skills in general.

Makale Başlığı: The Iranian Kurdistan Democratic Party as a Leading Actor in the Iranian Kurdish Political Movement
Özet: Armed groups with ethnic-separatist motivations try to reflect the images of "protectionism" and an alternative "political structure", along with the claim of representing the relevant ethnic group and identity. In this context, ethnic-separatist armed groups are in constant competition within this diversity; They argue that the ideological basis and political goal they have is the most ideal form for the relevant ethnic group, and that they are the only actor in the name of "protection and representation" of the relevant ethnic group. The Iranian Kurdish political movement and the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (DPIK) represent an important sample area of the dynamics revealed in the theoretical framework. In this study, the IKDP, which has been a pioneer in the Iranian Kurdish political movement since the 1940s, is discussed with its historical, ideological and structural dimensions and presented with a descriptive approach.

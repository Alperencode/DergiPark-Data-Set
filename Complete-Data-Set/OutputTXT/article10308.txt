Makale Başlığı: EFL Teachers' Reflective Teaching Practices amid the Covid-19 Pandemic
Özet: Purpose: The current survey portrays English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers’ familiarity with the concept of reflective teaching and the extentthat they carry out reflective teaching practices especially during their first experience with online teaching amid the Covid-19 Pandemic.Design/Methodology/Approach:In the current descriptive study, a varied sample of Turkish EFL teachers (N=117) filled out the online survey at the end of the first academic semester with an emergency online education period induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings: The study indicated that nearly forty per cent of the participants were unfamiliar with the concept of reflective teaching.  While metacognitive and affective practices were more commonly performed by the participants, the critical, practical and cognitive practices were rather less preferred. The participants hardly ever think of writing articles regarding their experiences, asking their colleagues to observe their teaching and also, relatively less contemplate on the socio-political sides of their teaching and their influences. Highlights: The notion of reflection and the reflective teaching strategies should be revisited, and accordingly, the scales or inventories should be reformulated by taking the premises of online education into consideration.

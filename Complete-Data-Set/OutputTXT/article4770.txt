Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Student and School Characteristics Affecting English Success with a Hierarchical Linear Model
Özet: The purpose of this study is to examine student and school characteristics related to English achievement. The study group of this research consists of 1533 students and 23 schools. The analyses of the data are carried out with Hierarchical Linear Models, which is one of the multi-level analysis techniques. According to the results of the study, approximately 17% of the variance in English achievement is due to the difference among schools. As academic emphasis and school size increase, students' English achievement increases. When the individual characteristics related to English achievement are examined, female students are more successful in English than males. Students with higher SES and education  aspirations  have higher English achievement. In addition, it has been found that there are negative relationships between bullying and English success, and the success levels of children who are exposed to bullying are lower. In order to increase the success of English, it is recommended to provide trainings that will increase the academic emphasis, to identify the students who are exposed to bullying and to direct them to the school guidance service, and to carry out the necessary studies to increase the education  aspirations.

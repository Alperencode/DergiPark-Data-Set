Makale Başlığı: Determination of Micropropagation Performance of Selected Peach-Nectarin Hybrids in In Vitro Iron Stress
Özet: Peaches and nectarines are among the fruit groups that are cultivated and have economic value. Plants with certain characteristics such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses are developed by interspecies hybridization. Reproduction of hybrid plants is carried out by plant tissue culture techniques and their response to stress factors in vitro conditions is examined. In this study, the response of peach-nectarine hybrids to iron stress in vitro was investigated. In this study, 10 hybrids were used as plant material. MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium containing FeSO4.7H2O (100%=27.8 mg/l) at different concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 100%) was used in in vitro iron stress experiments. 1 mg/l BAP was added to the nutrient media. The data on the growth coefficient (sibling/plantlet), plant height (cm) and number of leaves (number) as a result of in vitro iron stress were examined. As a result of the stress experiment, chlorosis was observed intensely in the nutrient medium without Fe, while better results were obtained in all other ratios. As a result of the study, it was determined that the hybrids (RÜ-8, RÜ-46 and VÜ-74) that developed well in nutrient media containing low Fe concentration had better responses to iron stress.

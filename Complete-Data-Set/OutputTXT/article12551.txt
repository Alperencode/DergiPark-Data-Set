Makale Başlığı: Nationalist Movement Party’s Approach to the Issue of National Culture and National Identity (1970s)
Özet: Nationalism, as an ideology based on national culture, also directs cultural policies and approaches. In the first institutionalization process of the national state in Turkey, unlike Ziya Gökalp’s solution, which was developed against possible identity crises due to the problem of systematization and survival of Turkish nationalism, religion was positioned outside the nationalism system, and culture was considered the same as civilization through the aim of creating high culture directly. Although this point of view is suitable for the period as a reflection of the anthropological point of view, it has also been the source of national integration problems in the process of nationalization, and it has also disrupted the collective consciousness, the way of action and the orientation to the contemporary future of Turkishness through the past and present. For this reason, in this study, the view of MHP, which is almost as old as Turkey’s nationalization process, on the issue of culture, national integration and national culture in order to consolidate the unity between the members of the nation, to reconcile the state and the nation, to protect the national body against cultural imperialism and to revive the “Turkish-Islamic Civilization” construction will be discussed.

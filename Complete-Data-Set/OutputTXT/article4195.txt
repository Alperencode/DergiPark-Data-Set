Özet: The following article aims, by means of an empirical study, to answer the questions of whether and to what extent English is relevant to adult and predominant learners of German in Turkey in both intrinsic and extrinsic ways. For this purpose, a survey was conducted at the end of the summer term of 2022 with 190 students of the German preparatory course and the degree programme ‘German Language and Literature’ at Namık Kemal University Tekirdağ (Turkey), taking that all participants in the survey had learned or were still learning English as their first or previous foreign language into consideration. The survey took the form of a questionnaire consisting of 24 quantitative questions and one qualitative question for cross-checking. The learners were asked about (1) the similarity of German and English, (2) the making of connections between the two languages, (3) the facilitation / impediment of learning German through English, (4) the making of connections between German and English on the part of the teachers, and (5) the making of connections between the two languages in learning materials. In this way, considering the results of the empirical study, the overall aim of this article is to contribute to the research of the learners’ perspective in the context of German as a tertiary language in Turkey.

Makale Başlığı: Is Koca Sinan the Architect of Bursa Galle Inn?
Özet: Ali Pasha Caravanserai, located in Bursa, is one of the caravanserai-han structures attributed to the works of Mimar Sinan. The inn is also known by names such as Yeni Gâlle Market, Gâlle Inn, Grain Inn. It was built by the Grand Vizier Semiz Ali Pasha in the 16th century, as the existing grain market was insufficient to meet the needs in Bursa. The basis for attributing the building to Mimar Sinan is that it is included in the manuscripts called Tezkiretü’l-Bünyan and Tezkiretü’l-Ebniye, which contain a list of Sinan’s works. Evliya Çelebi also confirms this information in his Seyahatname. In our study, it will be investigated whether the caravanserai, most of which is destroyed due to urbanization, was really built by Mimar Sinan or the effects of city architects on the construction and post-construction stages. With this research, it is aimed to present an up-to-date example of the importance and competencies of city architects.

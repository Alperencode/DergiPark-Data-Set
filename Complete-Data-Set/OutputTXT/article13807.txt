Makale Başlığı: Indicators of Digital Activism in New Media: A Study on Organizations Against Violence Against Women
Özet: Advances in information communication technologies have enabled activist groups to become interactive. In this context, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), associations, and platforms can effectively utilize the new media platforms Twitter and Instagram in the social movements, announcements, oppositions, and struggles. Especially in Turkey, where violence against women and bad situations such as murder and abuse are on the rise, especially the "Association for Struggle Against Sexual Violence" and "The Girl Alone" platforms appear as organizations that exhibit digital activism movements to draw attention to these issues. In this study, this association and the platform's shares on their official Twitter and Instagram accounts during one and a half months between 1 March and 15 April 2021 were examined. The study aimed to investigate how the Association for Struggle Against Sexual Violence and the Girl Alone Platform use new media in public relations models and determine how they reflect the dialogic communication principles. The code chart prepared for data analysis was created in line with the public relations models of Grunig and Hunt and the dialogic communication principles of Kent and Taylor. In this context, in this study, it is planned to draw a framework from the perspective of public relations regarding the use of new media to the concept of digital activism.

Makale Başlığı: TRANSFORMATION IN THE POWER MECHANISM FROM PANOPTICON TO BANOPTICON
Özet: Surveillance is the most important technique used by the government to maintain its hegemony, which has existed from the past to the present and has the ideal of legitimizing it in various ways. The phenomenon of surveillance has been applied in different ways and parallel to the conditions of the time and the developing technology, and the society has been tried to be kept under control. The development of new communication technologies has also been one of the important points that changed the face of power and surveillance techniques. Now the pressure has disappeared, instead, voluntarism has dominated. Due to the voluntary surveillance mechanism inherent in the new media, the surveillance mentality has taken on new forms. The individual, who was previously watched and imprisoned for the security of the system, is now excluded from the system for the security of the system. In this study, the changing phenomenon of surveillance with new communication technologies was examined. A literature review was conducted to reveal how surveillance has changed from past to present and with which concepts it is expressed in the literature. In this context, the concepts of panopticon, superpanopticon, synopticon, omnipticon, and banopticon are explained comparatively, and surveillance techniques and new concepts that emerge with new communication technologies are examined.

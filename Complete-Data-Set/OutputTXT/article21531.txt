Makale Başlığı: INFLUENCE OF GAMMA-RADIATION ON CURRENT DENSITY AND VOLT-AMPERE CHARACTERISTICS OF METALLIC ZIRCONIUM
Özet: The effect of preliminary radiation-oxidative treatment on the current density and current-voltage characteristic of metallic zirconium has been studied. The contribution of preliminary radiation-oxidative treatment to the change in the electro-physical characteristics during thermal and radiation-thermal tests in the contact of zirconium with water is revealed.

Makale Başlığı: Metacognition in Real Life Situations and Study Skills and Habits: Two Types of Processes
Özet: The relationship between metacognition in real life situations and study skills and habits was examined using a sample of college students. Results showed no significant relationship between these two variables nor was there a significant relationship between study skills and reaction time as measured on the metacognitive test. However, there was a positive significant correlation between study skills, and high school and college GPA's; a significant negative relationship between high school GPA and reaction time; and a positive significant correlation between high school GPA and metacognitive test scores calculated based on reaction time.

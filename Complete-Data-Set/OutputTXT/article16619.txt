Makale Başlığı: The Issues of Self and Identify in the Story “Piç” by Ömer Seyfettin
Özet: Ömer Seyfettin, who is a representative of the “New Language” movement in Turkish literature and considered one of the founders of the National Literature, constructs his stories usually on the idea of nationalism as he has an active role in the era he lived in in the actual and philosophical sense. In this context, it may be argued that Ömer Seyfettin, who aims to resurrect the identity information and cultural memory that develops along with nationalism, takes on a social mission in his stories.In this study, the story “Piç” by Ömer Seyfettin, which is among the stories that he builds upon main etyma such as national self/identity, sense of belonging, and clinging to cultural values, is discussed in the context of the issues of self and identity. In the story, the writer describes the existence of the Turkish nation as a concept that is dependent on the protection of a sense of individual and national self/identity by using self and identity information that protects the person against attacks in the physical and cultural fields and transfers their roots to the future. On the other hand, the writer, who does not consider the alienated tendencies of people who trivialize their attributes by making the sphere of both individual and social existence open to the attacks of the other as they do not have this conscience that is reflected in the emotional, philosophical and actual sphere unethical and indifferent, harshly criticizes the failure to preserve selves and identities. The story transforms into a polyphonic form of narration with the support of the writer, who adopts a cautionary and guiding discourse in addition to this critical discourse, for the content with psychological, sociological and historical information, as well as the richness he contributes to the narrative.

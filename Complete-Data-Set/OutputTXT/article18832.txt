Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the attitudes and beliefs of the 1st and 4th grade mathematics teacher candidates towards the teaching profession and the use of the history of mathematics in education. The research is a correlational research, which is one of the quantitative research methods. The study was conducted with 106 pre-service teachers studying in the first and fourth grades in the primary school mathematics teaching department of the education faculty of a state university in the Central Anatolia region. The data of the research were obtained with the Attitude and Belief Scale Regarding the Use of the History of Mathematics in Mathematics Education (MTETİ) developed by Alpaslan (2011), and the Attitude Scale towards Teaching Profession (ÖMYT) developed by Kahramanoğlu, Yokuş, Cücük, Vural, and Şiraz (2018). General analyzes of MTETİ and ÖMYT were performed using mean and standard deviation values. Factorial ANOVA analysis for Independent Samples and Independent Sample t-Test analysis were performed to determine whether the MTET and OMYT scores of pre-service mathematics teachers differed significantly according to the variables. The relationship between pre-service teachers' MTETİ and ÖMYT scores was interpreted with Pearson Product-Moment Correlation. The attitudes and beliefs of prospective teachers towards using the history of mathematics in their lessons and their attitudes towards the teaching profession are high and positive. In addition, it is statistically significant that female teacher candidates' attitudes and beliefs towards using the history of mathematics in their lessons and their attitudes towards the teaching profession are higher than male teacher candidates.

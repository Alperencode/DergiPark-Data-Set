Makale Başlığı: The Relation of Color Theories with Impressionism and the latter Art: The Independence of the Color
Özet: Each movement is in direct relation with the dynamics of that period in the time period it is in. The technology, thought, lifestyle of the time, as well as “human and society,” which is a part of the political-economic and political climate of the region, are formed within these dynamics. From this point of view, the technical developments of the period directly affected the movement and caused some breaks in form and content. The invention of the camera brought the realistic depiction aside, and the practical use of the paint in the tubes brought about the opening to the outdoors. With the abandonment of the studio environment, the artists pursued the light and, depending on it, the color. While color served the subject in pre-impressionist paintings, with Impressionism, color turned into a value on its own, independent of the form. When light and color became of primary importance, some color theories began to directly affect art.

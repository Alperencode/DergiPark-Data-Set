Makale Başlığı: LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FOREST MANAGEMENT IN OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS IN FORESTS
Özet: Among the duties and responsibilities of the state are to enable the individual to exercise his / her freedom to work, to eliminate threats against this right, and to take measures against the negative consequences that may occur in case of violation of the right. In the business relationship established between the employee and the employer based on the employment contract, the obligation of the employer to supervise the employee is a liability arising from the law. In the business relationship where mutual duties and responsibilities between the employee and the employer are regulated, the accident that the worker is exposed to suddenly and unexpectedly during the time the worker is under the command and instruction of the employer is considered an occupational accident.  Forestry, which is classified as a heavy and dangerous business, is a business that is open to possible occupational accidents. There are some legal regulations regarding the works to be done by forest workers in forestry areas. While the cutting, plowing, stacking, and transportation works done by the forest administration in the forests are mostly carried out by the unit price agreement, there has also been an increase in the standing-timber sale method recently. This study aims at determining the responsibility of the forest administration in the occupational accidents that the workers suffer during the work done in the forests according to the unit price contract and the standing-timber sale method by forest workers.

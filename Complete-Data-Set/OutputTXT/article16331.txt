Makale Başlığı: Determination of Some Physical Properties of Pellets Produced from Bagasse of Different Sweet Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor var. saccharatum (L.) Mohlenbr.] Genotypes
Özet: This study was carried out to determine some physical properties of the pellets obtained from bagasse of sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor var. saccharatum (L.) Mohlenbr.] genotypes grown as a second crop in Şanlıurfa-Türkiye conditions. In the study, after the stems of the harvested plants were squeezed and the water was removed, the remaining bagasse was dried and pellets were obtained. Physical properties such as moisture content, durability resistance, bulk density, particle density, hardness, and moisture absorption resistance affecting the pellet quality were determined. According to the two-year average results of the study, moisture content, durability, bulk density, particle density, and moisture sorption resistance ranged from 3.44 to 9.48%, 94.6 to 98.9%, 488 to 724 kg m3, 1039 to 1305 kg m3 and 9.98 to 16.60%, respectively. Hardiness resistance, on the other hand, differed according to genotypes, and it was determined as 3770 N on average in 2016 and 1908 N on average in 2017. According to the data obtained, pellets produced from sweet sorghum bagasse can be considered a renewable energy source that is not affected by ambient conditions and is easy to transport and store.

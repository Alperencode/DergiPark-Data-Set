Each value that is seen as valuable is defined as luxury goods. Luxury is a representation of images formed in people's minds. Every message that luxury consumption products conveyed to the other party allowed this consumption style to increase further.Within the scope of the study, semiotic analysis was applied to 10 commercials of 10 luxury brands for the presentation of luxury consumption products in advertisements.It has been determined that historical items, art and works of art, sharp colors such as red and black, as well as precious stones such as pearls and corals, as well as delicate flowers such as roses or orchids are used to describe luxury products in the advertisements analyzed by semiotic analysis method.

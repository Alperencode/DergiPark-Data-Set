Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Some Physicochemical and Microbiological Properties of Samples of Plain Ice Cream produced as Industrial and at Local
Özet: In this research, a total of 20 plain ice-cream samples, including 10 local and 10 industrial plain ice-cream samples presented for consumption in Erzurum province, were collected from the market and microbiological, physical and chemical analyzes were carried out on these samples. As a result of the microbiological analyzes, the average total aerobic mesophilic bacteria count (TAMB), yeast and mould count, number and group of coliform bacteria count in local ice cream samples have been calculated as 5.89 log cfu/g, 4.22 log cfu/g and 2.26 log cfu/g, respectively.  Identical analyzes have also been performed for industrial ice-cream samples, and all data mentioned for local samples have been calculated. These values are determined as 4.72 log cfu/g, <2.00 log cfu/g and <1.00 log cfu/g, respectively. Moreover, the average dry matter, sugar (sucrose), ash ratio, titratable acidity (0SH), pH, first dropping time, full melting time, % melting rate, viscosity (20, 50, 100 rpm) values of local ice cream samples have been calculated as 35.89%, 21.94%, 0.74%, 5.43, 6.25, 805 s, 2621 s, 67.84% and 1962, 1330, 930 cP, respectively. These values have also been calculated for industrial ice-cream samples as 35.25%, 19.23%, 0.81%, 4.04, 6.69, 747 s, 4051 s, 62.49% and 2896, 1540, 999 cP , respectively. As a result of these comparisons, industrial ice-cream samples are observed that they are generally in accordance with the standards in terms of the specified quality properties, however local samples do not meet the standarts and they have risks of health.

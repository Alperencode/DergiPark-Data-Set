Makale Başlığı: THE POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT AWARENESS STUDY ON
Özet: Organizational change is the transformation that results from the needs or obligations of the organizations. These transformations are often difficult and may encounter certain problems. Reasons such as the organizational structure's unwillingness to this situation and the unpreparedness of the employees may cause resistance to change. It is considered that this resistance may cause disruptions in fulfilling the mission of the organization. Organizational conflict, on the other hand, is the situation in the distribution of scarce resources within the organization, the assignment of work processes among employees, and the transformation of various problems within the organization into disagreements among employees. Resistance to organizational change, organizational conflict, are undesirable situations for organizations and are problems that are difficult to solve. Administrative solution proposals for the solution of these two problems and solution methods have been tried to be defined in the study in order to overcome the problem with the least damage. This study, which was written in order to take into account the possible relationship between these two concepts more in the field and to raise awareness for more studies on them, was tried to explain the purpose by trying to reveal the effect between the two variables in an intellectual sense by making a literature review by making a literature review. The study was handled in a conceptual framework and an original perspective was tried to be brought to the literature.

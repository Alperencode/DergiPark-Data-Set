Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Using a Celebrity in the Advertisements of Different Brands in the Same Time Period on Consumer Attitudes
Özet: All over the world, brands benefit from advertisements to ensure that their products or services are adopted by target audiences. Brands that want to get the best results from advertisements in the face of changing market and consumer behaviours often prefer to use celebrities in their advertisements in order to attract the attention of consumers who are exposed to too many stimuli in daily life. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of a celebrity in more than one advertisement at the same time on consumers, and to test the effect of celebrity support in advertisements on consumers' perceptions of approved brands or products.

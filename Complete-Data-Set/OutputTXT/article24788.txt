Makale Başlığı: Subcutaneous fat necrosis during hypothermia treatment in an asphyxiated infant
Özet: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is an important cause of permanent injury of central nervous system leading to neonatal death, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. Whole-body cooling therapy is the only effective treatment for HIE today. Subcutaneous fat necrosis during cooling period is rarely seen. A female newborn was born to 33-year-old gravida three parity two mother at 39 weeks of gestation by an emergent cesarean section due to fetal distress. The pregnancy course was complicated with gestational diabetes mellitus, mother received insulin therapy during the last trimester. On admission, she had abnormal neurological findings including hypotonia and absent neonatal reflexes. The patient was treated with postnatal hypothermia in the sixth hour of the method of whole body cooling. Forty-eight hours of treatment, subcutaneous fat necrosis was diagnosed and on the follow-up, the patient developed hypercalcemia and treated with pamidronate. Postnatal twenty-fifth day, patient was discharged with normal physical and neurological examination. Subcutaneous fat necrosis is a rare condition that can be seen during hypothermia period. Close monitoring of these patients because of hypercalcemia risk is important during follow-up.

Makale Başlığı: "EVERY DETERMINATION IS NEGATION": HEGEL, SPINOZA, AND ACOSMISM
Özet: The article discusses Hegel's infamous criticism of acosmism towards Spinoza. According to this criticism, Spinoza's philosophy is in the same camp as Parmenides, who sees the finite world as an illusion. Recent Spinoza readings have brought new criticisms to Hegel's interpretation of Spinoza. Accordingly, Hegel ignores the fact that Spinoza's philosophy is a positive metaphysics and places Spinoza in a position where he does not belong. According to this positive/affirmative metaphysics, the world is not an illusion, but an expression of the infinite richness of the nature of substance. In the article, it is argued that Hegel does not ignore the fact that Spinoza's philosophy envisages a positive metaphysics, rather, his criticism points to the logical impasse of such a metaphysics.

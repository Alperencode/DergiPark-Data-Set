Makale Başlığı: A study about properties acquired due to receivables by banks with the right of repurchase
Özet: The right of repurchase is a right that enables the former owner who sells property to the other side to buy it back. Property is the one of the most prevalent collateral accepted by banks. In order to manage and liquidate non-performing loans, banks may prefer acquisition of these properties with the right of repurchase. This practice may complicate removal of these properties from the balance sheet for a long time, since in the period of the contract about right of repurchase, banks are under the obligation to sell these properties nobody except the former owner or the right of repurchase can be asserted to any buyer. Execution of this kind of policy deliberately and widely may bring about reduction of liquidity of bank's assets.

Makale Başlığı: Social Responsibility of University: the Student Aspect
Özet: The paper highlights the student aspect of social responsibility of university. The relevance of the social responsibility of universities has been confirmed in many international documents, standards treaties, declarations, agreements, etc., aimed at spreading the principles of social responsibility throughout the world. The essence of the concept of social responsibility of universities is presented through socio-philosophical awareness of the concept of responsibility as a starting point for understanding concepts such as: “social responsibility”; “corporate social responsibility” and “university social responsibility”. Special attention is devoted to the role of students in the structure of social responsibility of universities, which was considered from two positions: the responsibility of universities to students and the responsibility of the students themselves as part of the university community.

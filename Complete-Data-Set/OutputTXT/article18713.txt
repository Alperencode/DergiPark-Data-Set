Makale Başlığı: Turkish Mother Tongue Instruction in Sweden
Özet: Home language education has a long tradition in Sweden and includes the teaching of Turkish to children who grow up bilingually with the societal language Swedish and with Turkish as their home and heritage language. The present paper characterises Turkish mother tongue instruction (MTI) and discusses its current status in light of Swedish language policy, as it is reflected in official documents (legislation, policy papers and curricula) vis-a-vis its practical implementation by the municipalities. The paper also presents findings from a research project on Turkish-speaking preschool and primary-school children and their families, concerning MTI attendance and attitudes towards Turkish, as well as on the experiences of Turkish MTI teachers in a Swedish setting.

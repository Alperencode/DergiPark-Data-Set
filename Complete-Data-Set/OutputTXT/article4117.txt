Makale Başlığı: Al-A‘yân Al-Thâbitah As The Source of Subjective Conception of God: A Metapsychological Investigation On The Relationship Between Disposition/Talent and Divine Names
Özet: In Ibn-al-Arabî’s school, the doctrine of “al-a‘yân al-thâbitah” includes two basic problematics. Firstly, al-a‘yân al-thâbitah, in so far as it points to the ontological origin of objective external existence -as can be seen in Plato’s eidê and also in Philo’s arkhetupa- refers to the starting point of the problematic relationship between ‘being’ (to on) and ‘becoming’ (genesis). Secondly, al-a‘yân al-thâbitah, in so far as it points directly to each individual’s ability/disposition/talent (isti‘dâd), to the special Lord, to the Divine Names, and the origin (al-ayn) of his/her vertical identity, refers to the source of difference in the specific realization of the problematic connection between God and man. We are going to be focus predominantly on the second aspect of the problematic in this article. It leads to the conclusion that each individual has to reach a subjective conception of God because of the reality of al-a‘yân al-thâbitah. In this respect, although each individual belongs to the same species (eidos), what prevents members of the species from being a mechanical repetition of the other and also makes individuals unique and authentic in terms of quality/attribute is special direction, vertical identity, the Divine Names, al-a‘yân al-thâbitah, all of which are closely related to each other.

Makale Başlığı: An Overview of the Glycemic Control of Diabetes Mellitus Patients Before and During the Pandemic
Özet: Aim: Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disorder characterized by high blood glucose and affects millions of people around the world with its complications. We believe that several factors during the pandemic have negatively affected the glycemic control of the patients. This study aimed to compare the glycemic controls of the patients admitted to the family health clinic of Incesu State Hospital before and during the pandemic. Material and Methods: Demographic data, HbA1c values, durations between the two admissions, and body mass indices of a total of 203 patients admitted to the family medicine clinic were assessed. Frequency, mean and standard deviation values were used in the analysis of the data.Results: A total of 203 patients who had HbA1c test before and during the pandemic were included in the study. Mean age of the patients was 60.87±15.24. Of the patients included in the study, 52.7% were female. Mean HbA1c value tested before the pandemic was lower than the mean HbA1c value tested during the pandemic.Conclusion: Increase in time spent at home, decrease in physical exercises and the presence of forcing psychological factors as a result of the measures taken have caused the glycemic control of the patients to impair. The individuals with chronic diseases can be supported by health authorities, which may help to solve the problems.

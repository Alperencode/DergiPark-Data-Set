Makale Başlığı: Objects and human: From posthumanism to nonhumanism
Özet: In today's academic world, where the aftermath of posthumanism as a relatively new field with strong intellectual infrastructure is being discussed, we experience an abundance of orientations trapped in the production-consumption cycle and set out with the intention of solving big problems without resolving their internal contradictions. One of the main reasons for this lies in the eagerness of the humanities field to evaluate the immature findings of the life sciences according to their face value and to extract new critical orientations or 'turns' from every scientific experiment or speculation. So much so that, the posthuman literature has departed from its basic principles and has become trapped in the vicious circle of postmodernism's text-reductionist, subject-relativist methods. As is well known, post-modernist terminology such as 'narrative,' 'text,' 'genre,' 'border,' 'literature,' 'body-writing,' and so on abound in works on posthumanist orientations. This paper will critique the discourses of the Anthropocene and the body on which posthumanism, which operates in quite different directions, is built, and show how they do not reject the nature-culture dichotomy but rather support it. Then, inspired by speculative realist philosophy, it will support the concept of nonhuman as an umbrella concept instead of posthumanism and explain its ethical stance.

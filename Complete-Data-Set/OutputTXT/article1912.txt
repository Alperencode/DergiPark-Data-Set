Makale Başlığı: Surface properties of wood material impregnated with copper-based chemical (Korasit KS) after natural weathering
Özet: In this work, the surface characteristics of Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis L.) wood impregnated with Korasit KS, a water-based and copper-containing impregnation substance, were examined after three months of natural weathering. The impregnation material was penetrated into the wood material at 3% and 6% concentration levels according to the ASTM D 1413-07 (ASTM 2007) standard. According to the results obtained, the L* values of all samples decreased after natural weathering. Furthermore, impregnated samples provided better color stability than control samples. Moreover, this stability increased as the concentration amount increased in the impregnation process. While the gloss of all samples decreased after natural weathering, this decrease was more in control samples. According to the surface roughness test results, Ra, Rz and Rq values of all samples increased after natural weathering. This increase was more in the impregnated samples.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis and Comparison of Abdulhalık Uygur's "Wake Up" Poem And Mircevat Ahıskalı's "Ahıska Anthem" with the Ontological Method
Özet: Literary works are examined with different perspectives and analysis methods and the deep structure expressed by the work is tried to be revealed. One of these methods is the ontological analysis method. This method, which started to be seen in the west since the 1930s, was identified with İsmail Tunalı in our country.Art ontology, entity strata with the views of Roman Ingarden and Nicolai Hartmann partingly divides into layers. By applying these layers to fields such as painting, music, poetry, novels and theater, works of art can be examined through an ontic process. The ontological analysis method to be used in the analysis is a structuralist approach in essence, but it is also a method that focuses on the meaning world of the work. By contributing to the views of Tunalı, Ingarden and Hartman with his own ideas, he proposes four layers of existence. These are meaning layer, object layer, character layer and destiny layer. In the study, firstly, ontological analysis method was introduced with its main lines; then, information was given about poets. Abdulhalık Uygur's poem "Uyan" and Mircevat Ahıskalı's "Ahıska Anthem" were analyzed by ontological analysis method. The analysis has been examined within the framework of the "Awake" metaphor. In the last part, these two poems are compared.

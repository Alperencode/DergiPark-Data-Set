Makale Başlığı: Regarding the Current National Security Challenges
Özet: Issues such as globalization, developments in communication and information technologies, and economic and social inequalities that are becoming more evident between countries, cause conflicts to become globalized beyond regional borders. Therefore, in the process of national security administration, it is needed to be referred to the process and direction of developments, rather than creating pre-absolute equations. In this context, the current security environment is characterized by an increase both in the number of military conflicts and other human-induced problems that threaten human life and co-existence. These challenges force national security professionals, whose primary mission is to establish security, to focus on security issues in a multidimensional way in order to fulfill their duties. Therefore, the quality of the adopted national security conception is critical to the establishment of today's security and peaceful environment. In this study, which is carried out on current national security challenges; it is aimed to present the current security environment and its challenges in detail. This study focuses on wider areas affecting the perception and execution of national security and so provides a comprehensive overview of information about the dimensions of the current security environment.

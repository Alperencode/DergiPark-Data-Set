Makale Başlığı: The ILO’s Safety and Health in Mines Convention: Reframing the Scope of Obligations for a Sustainable World
Özet: OnMarch 23, 2015 the Turkish government ratified ILO Convention No. 176, theinternational labour convention concerning occupational safety and health inmines. This multilateral treaty will enter into force for Turkey in 2016. Aftera lengthy advocacy campaign that received renewed attention after majordisasters in the mining industry, more attention is being paid to theimplementation of this important ILO convention. Post-ratification applicationof the convention in the unique Turkish context requires revisiting theobligations of the convention itself. Whether the convention becomes an emptypromise to Turkish mine workers or a living document for the protection ofworker safety and health remains an open question. Recent recommendations by anILO technical assistance project raise important questions about the scope ofConvention No. 176 and the need for stronger efforts by the Turkish state toachieve reform in the coal mining industry. This article discusses the ILO’sSafety and Health in Mines Convention in light of recent ILO technicalassistance work in Turkey. It outlines arguments in favor of a more expandedlegal interpretation of the obligations of Convention No. 176 in light ofdangerous business practices in the coal mining industry and in light of theglobal community’s new international consensus on sustainable development

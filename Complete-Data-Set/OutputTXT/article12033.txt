Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE DECISION-MAKING ATTITUDES OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND PUBLIC OVERSIGHT EXPERTS
Özet: Independent Audit activities are the most crucial stage in controlling financial processes in businesses. Auditors who perform these activities are also an integral part of this process. Auditor's independence is closely related to the auditor's ethical attitude. The majority of audit failures are due to problems with auditor ethics. Auditors may remain in ethical dilemmas while making decisions during the audit phase. On the other hand, public oversight may face ethical dilemmas when examining the activities of auditors. The study aims to evaluate the decision-making attitudes of auditors in ethical dilemmas. For this reason, independent auditors and experts and assistant experts working in the Public Oversight, Accounting, and Auditing Standards Institution were evaluated in terms of their decision-making attitudes in ethical dilemmas. And so, a survey was conducted through the "Eight Ethical Scales", which will determine the decision-making attitudes of the auditors in ethical dilemmas. As a result of the research, the decision-making attitudes of KGK experts and independent auditors in ethical dilemmas and the factors that KGK experts and auditors consider when making decisions in case of ethical dilemmas were evaluated.

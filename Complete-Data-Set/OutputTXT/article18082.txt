Makale Başlığı: Preventive Health in Medical Education Curriculum: Inonu University Faculty of  Medicine Example
Özet: Although medicine is known as therapeutical and preventive medicine, today medical faculties train medical doctors mainly for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, preventive medicine aims to remove risk factors before clinical medicine is needed. In order to raise consciousness in medical faculty students about preventive health at the beginning of their education life, 32-hour preventive health course with 18 topics was added in the first committee of İnönü University Medical Faculty 2017-2018 first year academic program. Our purpose in this study was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of preventive health course newly added in the curriculum and to learn the opinions of academic members teaching the course and first year students taking the course. In our study, we gave a questionnaire of 15 questions to academic members in different departments who were teaching the course and a questionnaire of 14 questions to students on preventive medicine course following the committee. 19 academic members who taught in the committee and 66 students who took the course participated in the questionnaire. While 78% of the academic members stated that they believed the course was useful, 69% of the students thought that the course was useful. While 74% of the academic members stated that they believed students could apply what they learned in the course in real life, 71% of the students stated that the course made them realize where they could use the new information they learned. 65% of the students stated that through the course, they realized there were things they thought they knew but actually did not know. We believe that through these positive feedbacks, preventive health courses will be enriched more in terms of content and material and they will be taught more effectively in the forthcoming years

Makale Başlığı: Cognitive Distortions as a Predictor of Social Adaptation among Refugees in Turkey
Özet: This study focused on examining the role of cognitive distortions as a predictor of social adaptation  among  refugees  in  Turkey.  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  first  of  all, participants who migrated to Turkey after the Syrian War were asked whether they were exposed to the situations listed in the Traumatic Events List. To collect data, “Cognitive Distortions Scale”, “Revised Sociocultural Adaptation Scale”, “Traumatic Events List” and “Demographic Information Form” were used. In addition, the extent to which the cognitive  distortions  of  these  individuals  predicted  their  social  adaptation  was investigated. As a result of the hierarchical linear regression analysis, it was observed that the sub-dimensions of cognitive distortions, “seeing life as dangerous”, “helplessness” and “hopelessness” were significant predictors of adaptation. Cognitive distortions of refugees, the way they explain the events in the environment, come to the fore as a factor that  prevents  them  from  adapting  to  the  new  life.  This  study  also  offers  various suggestions for future studies to increase the adaptation of refugee individuals.

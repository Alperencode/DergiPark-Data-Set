Makale Başlığı: The Legal Status of the Offshore Bunkering Activities in the context of Uncertainties regarding the Allocation of Rights and Jurisdiction in the Exclusive Economic Zone
Özet: In the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), codified by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the coastal state has been granted various rights and jurisdiction, primarily over the natural resources there. On the other hand, it has been accepted that other states enjoy in the EEZ some of the freedoms that have long been recognized on the high seas, subject to the relevant provisions of the Convention. The Convention also provides that conflicts regarding rights and jurisdiction not attributed to the coastal state or to other states should be resolved on the basis of equity, taking into account the relevant circumstances, and interests of the parties concerned. Despite the existence of provisions that are comprehensive and consider different possibilities, it is not always easy to determine whether the activities in the EEZ fall under the jurisdiction of the coastal state or other states. The aforementioned provisions include open-ended terms and generally require reading together with other relevant articles of the Convention. The issue of which state and to what extent is authorized in terms of bunkering activities in the EEZ, which are not clearly regulated in UNCLOS, leads to various disputes, and reveals the need to carefully consider both the provisions of the Convention and the purposes and characteristics of the activity in question. This study aims to examine and evaluate the legal status of bunkering activities in the EEZ in the light of the allocation of relevant rights and jurisdiction, judicial decisions and academic approaches.

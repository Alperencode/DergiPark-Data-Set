Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Refugees on Kilis Culture and Economy
Özet: The average three million refugees emigrated from Syria to Turkey. Many of these refugees have left their country with their own means. Immigrants have struggled with unemployment in Turkey. With the unrequited assistance and support of the Turkish state to refugees, they settled in Turkish territory. In addition to the humanitarian aid provided by the Turkish state to the people, many of whom live in refugee camps, the personal assistance of people to refugees in Turkish cities is very high. The Turkish people, who see these people as their own siblings, have cultural interaction with Syrian immigrants. After cultural interaction, these people created a cheap labor market. Benevolence and cultural interaction have also affected the labor market. Kilis is located in Turkey's southern border. It is a city about 30 km from Syria. According to statistics, Kilis is a province with the highest density refugees in Turkey. More than three times the population of refugees lives in this city. In this study, most of the Syrian refugee samples were selected from this city. Issues such as intercultural interaction, health problems, education issue and contribution to economic development are discussed in this study.

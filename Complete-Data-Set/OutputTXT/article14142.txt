Makale Başlığı: How to help the helpers?: Integrative Group Therapy Practices with Professionals in Disasters
Özet: Disasters are events that occur due to nature, people, or technology, cause physical, psychosocial, and economic destruction, severely affect daily life dynamics and cause stress. Search and rescue teams, first and emergency aid personnel, law enforcement officers, members of the media and psychosocial support personnel carry out studies on the prevention and reduction of the devastating effects of disasters. Due to the challenging conditions of the disaster area and the intensity of exposure to traumatic events that disaster workers could have post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, depression, and psychosomatic disorders. Psychosocial interventions are used to empower them. One of these interventions is integrative group therapy (IGT). It is a form of psychotherapy that combines various therapeutic tools and approaches via the needs of disaster workers. The IGT includes three modules. The primary module includes the psychoeducation program about stressors about disasters. In the secondary module, feelings, thoughts and experiences related to traumatic stress are shared and individuals at risk are identified. The tertiary module includes an intensive program of individual psychotherapies with medication, family therapy or other therapy schools. It is considered that IGT will be beneficial in terms of social workers both being as disaster workers and being psychosocial support personnel helping disaster workers.

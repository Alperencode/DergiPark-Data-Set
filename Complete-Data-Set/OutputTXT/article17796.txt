Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effects of Rhizobacteria Applications on Plant Growth of Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Grown under Drought Stress
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the effects of rhizobacteria on some biochemical and physiological properties of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in arid conditions. Akman-98 bean variety was used as plant material in the experiment, which was established as four replications in factorial order according to the completely randomized plots experimental design. The study was established with the control group (B0), nitrogen fixer (B1), phosphorus solvent (B2), and nitrogen fixer + phosphorus solvent (B3) rhizobacteria applications. In the experiment, three different drought stresses were applied as NS (Normal water=100%), K1 (Drought 1=50%), and K2 (Drought 1=25%). In the experiment, leaf area (cm2), chlorophyll ratio (µg/cm2), leaf temperature (°C), relative water content (%) in leaf tissues, ion leakage in leaf tissues (%), membrane durability index (%) in leaf tissues, and malondialdehyde content (nmol/g1) were investigated. As a result of the common interaction of the factors in the study, the highest value in the leaf area was obtained from the B1xNS application with (55.31 cm2), while the lowest values (30.61 cm2 and 32.20 cm2) were obtained from the B1xK1 and B3xK2 applications. When the chlorophyll ratio was examined, the highest value was obtained from the B0xK1 application with 41.33 (µg/cm2), and the lowest value was obtained from the B3xK2 application with 28.83 (µg/cm2). In the study, the highest ion leakage value in leaf tissues was obtained from the B3xK3 application with 34.36%, and the lowest value was obtained from the B1xK1 application with 28.27%. In the experiment, the highest values of membrane durability index in leaf tissues (78.55% and 78.51%) were obtained from B0xK2 and B2xK3 applications, and the lowest values (68.57%, 67.84%, and 68.98%) were obtained from B1xK2, B2xK1, and B3xK3 applications, respectively. However, in order to achieve more realistic results, such studies are required under field conditions.

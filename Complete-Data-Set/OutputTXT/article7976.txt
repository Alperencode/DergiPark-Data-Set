Makale Başlığı: Understanding China Through Sharp Power: Dragon's Teeth?
Özet: China is making important initiatives in economic and political issues to become a global power. China's initiatives determine the approaches of other countries, especially those who see China as a threat. In this context, “sharp power” (锐实力) as a new concept of International Relations literature has been used to define China. In this study, the emergence of sharp power concept is discussed; China's sharp power policies are illustrated with various examples; and criticisms directed to the concept are mentioned. Also, many problems related to the concept have been shown, and a holistic approach to the concept has been put forward in the study. In this study, based on the literature, it has been shown that there is a “concept war” between the global powers and that China is left behind in this framework. In International Relations studies, the aims of states in international politics or cooperation or conflict situations with other countries are analyzed with smart power, soft power and many other concepts. With this study, it is aimed to contribute to both the International Relations discipline and the Chinese foreign policy literature with sharp power, which is a new concept in the discipline of International Relations.

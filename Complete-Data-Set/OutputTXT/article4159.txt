Makale Başlığı: THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF POLAND EUROPEAN UNION RELATIONS:  A REALIGNMENT OR A ROLE CHANGE?
Özet: The EU has imposed on Poland, upon the regulations by the Law and Justice Party, which came to office in 2015, on press freedom, executive influence in the courts, gender policies, and environmental policies. In the study, these regulations are assessed in terms of their practical, legal, and European integration dimensions. This paper analyses Poland’s positive role in the Euro-Atlantic alliance as a ‘regional-subsystem collaborator’ between 1990 and 2015; nonetheless, it identifies this role, which has changed after 2015, as a state focus on her ‘internal development’. In this study, we assess the likelihood of the present role shift that may lead to Polexit low; on the contrary, we argue that the continuance of the Russia-Ukraine crisis will drive Poland to seek a more suitable role with the requirements of the Euro-Atlantic alliance.

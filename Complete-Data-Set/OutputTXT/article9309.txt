Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of proprioceptive balance results of amateur athletes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Hamstring autograft
Özet: Aim: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the main ligaments which provide mechanical stability of the knee, control the anteroposterior translation and rotation movements and play a key role in neuromuscular stability. The aim of the present study is to compare the 6th month balance results on operated and non-operated sides of athletes who underwent ST/G anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL). Material and Method: The study was evaluated as a retrospective cohort consisting of patients who underwent semitendinosus/gracilis hamstring autograft (ST/G) ACL reconstruction (n=24) technique between May 2020 and October 2021. CSMI-TecnoBody PK-252 was used to determine the 6th month post-operative static balance measurements of patients. The tests were applied to both ACLR side and contralateral healthy side. Results: Compared to pre-operative levels, there was a significant improvement in the mean Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC scores at the post-operative level (p<0.05). No significance was found between 6th month post-operative static balance results of the subjects on ACLR side and contralateral healthy side (p>0.05).Conclusion: It is seen that 6 month post-operative findings of ST/G ACLR technique show similar results with the healthy contralateral side. This result is valuable in terms of balance scores showing similar results for both sides.

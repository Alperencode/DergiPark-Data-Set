Makale Başlığı: A Criticism on Some Rules of Qawaid Al-Tafsir: The Case of Habanneqah al-Meydani
Özet: The importance of the Arabic language for the correct understanding of the Qur'an is an indisputable fact. For this reason, scholars have tried to determine the language-based rules that guide the thoughts of the commentators in order to understand the message given by the Qur'an correctly. This approach, which has its counterpart in the science of tafsir, has led to the emergence of the concept of Kavâidü't-Tafsir. This approach, which could not find its equivalent in the first (h. I-IV) and middle (h. V-IX) periods, has recently gained popularity. In the study, firstly, the history of the concept of Kavâidü't-Tafsir is discussed. Then, the definition of this concept was made by considering the works in the literature. Specific to the definition made, Habenneke el-Meydani's work "Kavâ‘idü't-Tedebburi'l-Emsel li-Kitâbillâhi Azze ve Celle" was chosen as a sample. The definition of the concept of kavâidü't-Tafsir and the related work in the context of the classification created on this subject have been examined. In the classification made, the bases that Habenneke determined in his work; It has been handled as a directing the activity of interpreting the Qur'an and as an interpretation (result) extracted from the verse. As a result, in this research, the nature of the rules that Habenneke determined in his work in terms of Kavâidü't-Tafsir has been revealed.

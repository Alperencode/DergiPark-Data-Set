Makale Başlığı: A Look at the Professional Career of Süreyya Hüsnü Anderiman
Özet: This article is about Süreyya Hüsnü Anderiman, a valuable bureaucrat-diplomat of the Republic of Türkiye. Anderiman was educated in qualified institutions, and was fluent in several Western languages. Making a start on his professional career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1926, Anderiman served at various levels in the Foreign Ministry and was appointed as the Director of the Office of Private Secretary of the Presidency in 1934, which provided that his connection in the Ministry remained intact and seniority advanced. After Atatürk's death, Anderiman, who continued his duty during the Presidency of İsmet İnönü, emerged as one of the most popular bureaucrats of his time. Being the longest serving bureaucrat as the Director of the Office of Private Secretary of the Presidency, Anderiman, in 1945, was dismissed from this position and was returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then shifted to the field of diplomacy. Served as Turkish Envoy Extraordinary to Oslo from 1946-1957 and as Turkish Ambassador to Tokyo from 1957-1959, Anderiman passed away while was on duty in Tokyo. Having been mentioned in the Turkish press briefly due to his death, Anderiman was forgotten in the dark corridors of the history gallery later on and has not been the subject of any academic study except for Atatürk Encyclopedia article until now. This issue stands out as a deficiency that needs to be eliminated in the historical literature of the Republic of Türkiye. This article, which aims to reveal the life adventure of Süreyya Hüsnü Anderiman by focusing on his professional career, and thus to make him more known; was created by using archival sources, domestic and foreign official publications, academic studies, periodicals, memoirs and internet resources.

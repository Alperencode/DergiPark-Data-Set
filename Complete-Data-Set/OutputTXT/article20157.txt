Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Antioxidant Properties and Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents of Honey Bee Hive Products Collected from the Ankara Region
Özet: In this study, the total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) profiles of multifloral honey, bee bread, bee pollen, and drone larvae (apilarnil), which are among the products of bee hives, were determined. In addition, the antioxidant activities of the aforementioned products were determined by 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay methods. Honey, bee bread, bee pollen, and apilarnil samples collected from 10 honey bee hives in the Ankara region were the material of the study. As a result of the analysis, TP content levels were found to be in the order of bee pollen > bee bread > honey > apilarnil, while TF contents were in the order of bee pollen > bee bread > apilarnil > honey. Considering the results of the DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays, the levels of activity were determined in the order of honey > bee pollen > bee bread > apilarnil. The highest antioxidant activity level determined in honey was concluded to be the result of synergistic antioxidant effects of other bioactive complex substances contained in honey. Therefore, we believe that bioactive complex substances that increase the antioxidant activity level of honey should be evaluated in future studies.

Makale Başlığı: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 5D discrete Fourier transform number operator revisited
Özet: A systematic analytic approach to the evaluation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 5D discrete number operator N_5 is formulated. This approach is essentially based on the use of the symmetricity of 5D discrete Fourier transform operator fi_5 with respect to the discrete reflection operator P_d.

Makale Başlığı: The Development of the Covering System of Konya Mosques in the Anatolian Seljuk and Ottoman Periods
Özet: Mosques are the most specific structures of the Islamic city. The formation of these buildings in history also gives direction to the architectural character of the period. The top cover system and the dome have been important elements of the space organization. In the mosques of the Anatolian Seljuk period, the single-dome arrangement was developed in the Ottoman period and reached the central domes and side naves. Today's mosque architecture is also affected by the developments in the historical process and it is seen that modern top covering systems are experienced. Konya had hosted important civilizations from prehistoric times to the present and had been the capital of the Anatolian Seljuk State for many years. The number of mosque structures belonging to this period and reaching the present day is higher than other cities in Anatolia. The city did not lose its importance in the Ottoman period, and its spiritual value continues today. The coexistence of mosque structures of this period with the mosques of the Anatolian Seljuk period enables a comparison of the cover systems and its development chronologically.

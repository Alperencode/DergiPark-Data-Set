Makale Başlığı: The Covid-19 Pandemic and the Right to the Privacy of the Individual's Health Data
Özet: The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China in the last months of 2019 and spread throughout the world in a short time, is one of the issues that occupy the agenda of the states since its beginning. In this process, the disease showed itself in almost every country, was declared as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, caused many people to face serious health problems and die. Considering the time it took for scientists to clarify the uncertainty in matters such as the mode of transmission, course and long-term effects of the disease, and the ways of protection from the disease, the size of the danger has followed an increasing graph. In this grave situation, the states made an effort to research and implement the most effective measures as soon as possible. Some of these measures are related to the privacy of the individual's health data. In this context, it has been observed that some activities are subject to authorization to be obtained by sharing health data such as HES Code, PCR test or vaccination information, and those who refuse to share these data are deprived of their rights and freedoms. Our study aims, on the one hand to deal with the conceptual and theoretical aspects of health data, which is within the scope of the right of individuals to protect their private lives and whose acquisition, processing, preservation and sharing is bound to strict conditions by the relevant legislation; on the other hand to discuss the legitimacy of demanding the sharing of these data in terms of individual rights and freedoms during the Covid-19 pandemic.

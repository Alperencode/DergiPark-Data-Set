Makale Başlığı: Interpersonal Communication in the Context of the Relationship between Ideology and Discourse in the Post-Truth Age: The Example of Twitter
Özet: Post-truth, which is a popular concept in the social and political field, is the determination of the truth by feelings and beliefs instead of objective realities when individuals decide or make an opinion on a subject. The individual's feeling of well-being is his priority, so the reality is not only losing its importance, but also tending to the search for a reality and truth that is in the interest of the individual. Discourse analysis is the linguistic analysis of texts, conversations, everyday language, and many other messages in general. However, van Dijk introduced the Critical Discourse Analysis method by giving a new perspective to this discourse study. He also added the ability to analyze in micro and macro fields to discourse analysis. In this research, one of the news that was circulated on Twitter during the 2019 Local Elections but was debunked by Teyit.org and published on the Twitter accounts of the newspapers will be selected. This news will be analyzed with Critical Discourse Analysis. To bring a new perspective to this method, not only the news tweet, but also 11 user comments on the tweet will be selected and included in the Critical Discourse Analysis.In this context, the research aims to show the social polarization environment experienced during the local election period, based on user comments.

Makale Başlığı: Examining of Vitamin D Levels in Children in Terms of Some Factors
Özet: Objective: Vitamin D deficiency is known as a health problem affecting infants and adolescents. In this study, it was aimed to examine vitamin D levels in children aged 0-18 years, who were enrolled in XXX training and research hospital. In addition, it was determined whether there was a statistically significant difference in vitamin D level according to age, gender, year and season factors.Material and Methods: In this study, 784 children who applied to the Pediatrics Polyclinic between 01.03.2018 and 01.03.2021 were included. In this study, vitamin D values of children were determined in our hospital laboratory according to age, gender, year and season factors. Those with autoimmune diseases, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, multiple sclerosis, cancer and those using vitamin D were not included in the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 package program, student t test and one-way anova.Results: Of the 784 patients who came to the hospital, 337 (43%) were boys and 447 were girls (57%). Serum vitamin D level was calculated as 37.58±9.86 ng/mL in girls and 37.18±10.58 ng/mL in boys. The mean serum vitamin D level was 37.41±10.15 ng/mL. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was found to be 33.76%±11.83 ng/mL in winter, and 37.35±11.68 ng/mL in summer months. Vitamin D levels were found to be significant only in terms of the year factor (p<0.001). However, no significant difference was found according to gender, age and season (p>0.05).Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was detected in children admitted to our hospital. It was concluded that vitamin D levels in children varied at different levels according to gender, age, year and season factors. Since low vitamin D levels are associated with many chronic diseases, preliminary information about the early diagnosis of these diseases can be obtained by determining vitamin D levels.

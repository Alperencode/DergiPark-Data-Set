Makale Başlığı: WOODEN TOYS CATEGORIZATION
Özet: It is an undisguised and unconcealable reality that toys made of wood, which are generally created in a simple and plain fiction by their nature, develop imagination and support creativity on the basis of critical thinking in preschool children. Therefore, wooden toys, which have an important place in child development with their versatility and functionality, have a unique design style and way of presentation. Wooden Toy Categorization, designed by Usta (2013), is an arrangement that has been put forward for this purpose. Wooden Toy Categorization, which was designed for pre-school children aged 0-6 (0-72 months) within the course “Educational Wooden Toys” that was opened for the students of Hacettepe University in the context of updating Wood Products Industrial Engineering curriculum in 2013 within the scope of the Bologna process within the Coordinator of the Elective Courses Unit under the responsibility of the Vocational Technology School, was prepared in terms of the number of categories and the sub-categories as 19/64 in 2016 and subsequently developed as 23/72 in 2018 and as 26/89 in 2020. This study shows the latest version of “wooden toy categorization” that was presented here as 27/118 in 2022 in terms of its innovative content. As a result, Wooden Toy Categorization, which was developed with one new category and twenty-nine new sub-categories added to the current arrangement with a systematic creative thinking approach based on observations and experiences regarding the framework of the course in question, consists of the following categories, while the sub-categories within each category have been tabulated and explained in the text: Blocks, Jigsaw, Musical Instruments, Hummer Peg, Balancer, Stringing and Threading, Combined, Dress Up, House, Whirligig, Figures, Learning Letters, Nesting, Slider, Puppet, Stacking, Venue Sampling, Model Items, Wading, Pedalless Bicycle, Rocking Horse, Learning Numbers, Scooter (Wheeled Slide), Equipped, Vehicle, Puzzle, Monotonous.

Makale Başlığı: DIGITAL LEADERSHIP: A SCALE ADAPTATION STUDY
Özet: The digital leadership scale was developed by Zeike, Bradbury, Lindert, and Pfaff (2019) since there is no scale suitable for the digital leadership skills of managers and whose validity has been proven. It is aimed to adapt the digital leadership scale, which was developed for empirical studies on digital leadership in Turkey, into Turkish, and to conduct validity and reliability studies. For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied to the employees of a factory producing electronic household goods in Manisa. Survey data were analyzed with the SPSS and AMOS programs. The findings reveal that the digital leadership scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that could be used in research to be conducted in Turkey.

Makale Başlığı: Some Concepts Related to Education in Fahruddin er-Razi’s (d. 606/1210) Mafâtîhu’l-Ghayb Commentary
Özet: Education aims to change people in the desired way by directing them. In the historical process, many concepts have been used to emphasize this change. The determination of these concepts based on classical sources is important in terms of religious education in general and the history of Islamic education in particular. Some of these resources are specifically related to education, while others are not directly related to education. However, it is seen that concepts related to education are also included in such sources. One of the works that will be mentioned in this regard is Fahruddîn er-Râzî’s (d. 606/1210) tafsîr named Tafsîru’l-Fahri’r-Râzî/at-Tafsîru kabîr/Mafâtihu’l-ghayb. It is seen that Razî gives place to the concepts related to education, especially when it comes to the training, education and teaching of Allah. For this reason, the study aims to reveal the concepts that Razî mentioned about education and training while interpreting the verses. In this context, the study is limited to this work, as the information will be obtained primarily from Razî’s commentary on the aforementioned. As a result, it has been determined that in Razî’s tafsîr, different concepts related to education, training and more specifically the religious and moral education of human beings (tarbiyah, adab/ta'dîb, ta‘lîm, tahzîb, tazkiyah etc.) are included. Some of these concepts (such as tarbiyah) emphasize a process of education not only from human to human, but from Allah to human.

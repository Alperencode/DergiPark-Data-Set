Makale Başlığı: Turkish Works Written on Qasīdah al-Burdah (Bānet Suʿād) in the Ottoman Period
Özet: One of the works of Islamic literature on which the largest number of secondary texts (commentary/sharh, translation etc.) has been written is Kaʿb b. Zuhayr’s Qasīdah al-Burdah. The attraction of this work is due to the fact that it was presented to Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) in person and received her praise and benevolence. Kaʿb, the son of Zuhayr b. Ebī Sulmā who is one of the Seven Hanging Odes (Muʿallakāt as-Sabʿa) poets, firstly draw the reaction of the Muslims by saying some couplets that satirized the Prophet, but later regretted her attitude, came to The Prophet’s masjid and expressed his apology with this ode. Thereupon, The Prophet gifted the cardigan (burdah) he was wearing at that moment to Kaʿb, and for this reason, the poem became famous as Qasīdah al-Burdah.Since this poem was liked and rewarded by The Prophet, it has been met with uninterrupted interest since the day it was composed. Secondary texts which started to be written on the ode from the early periods and formed a unique literature, are also one of these planes. This study has been prepared to introduce such Turkish works written on the eulogy during the Ottoman period by classifying them. In this context, we identified 24 works and there is no doubt that this number will increase as a result of new research. These Turkish works alone are sufficient to show that there was an intense interest in this poetry during the Ottoman period.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Spatial Needs in Primary Education Spaces in Terms of Educational Approaches
Özet: The changeable characteristic of educational spaces, where teachers and students spend most of their time, according to students’ and teachers’ wishes, will create positive effects on both students’ development and educational activities. Within the study’s scope, interviews were done with academicians who are experts in this field to acquire information on topics like identifying what the spatial needs of classrooms in primary schools are/might be; determining how these needs should change in line with educational approaches. The sampling method in the study, which was planned as a qualitative study, was determined as the non-random purposeful sampling (judgement sample) and snowball sampling. Following the interviews, it was concluded that the physical setting of educational spaces plays an active role in students’ success and learning spaces should be designed in view of students’ needs and individual differences according to contemporary educational approaches where the student is active and at the center.

Makale Başlığı: Space Tourism, Travel and Innovation
Özet: Space tourism is a rapidly developing form of tourism in the 21st century thanks to innovation and digitalization, and high-income travelers ready for a crazy adventure compete for a breathtaking journey they have never tasted in their lives. In this race, there is fierce competition between private space tourism companies from developed countries. At the beginning of the 21st century, British billionaire Richard Branson and his team made the first civilian private space travel in July 2021 with the Virgin Galactic space plane. Then, Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder) made a suborbital trip with three people next to him with the rocket named New Shepard, designed by the private spaceflight company Blue Origin, about a week after Branson. However, the first person to receive the title of space tourist is Denis Tito, an American billionaire who went to the orbiting International Space Station in 2001. However, Denis Tito went to the International Space Station with a Russian Soyuz rocket, not with a spacecraft developed by his own space company, such as British Richard Branson and US Jeff Bezos. This article, while briefly reviewing the history and development process of space tourism, which can be considered as special interest tourism separate from traditional tourism, examines the effects of technological innovations on space travel, a private initiative in the space race, space tourism economy, and future expectations. The research has been linked by scanning academic research, theses, news, and publications related to space tourism and combining them with World Bank, OECD, and UNCTAD publications. Thus, the importance of the shift from orbital space travel to suborbital space travel for the expanding techno-industrial world and the difficulties in making space tourism a reality are revealed.

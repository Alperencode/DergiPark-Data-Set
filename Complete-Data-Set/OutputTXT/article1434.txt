Makale Başlığı: Constructing The Balkans: Emotion Politics of Pop Culture and Balkanization Discourse
Özet: In today's world, where technology has developed so fast and digitalization has spread to almost every area of life, visual artifacts have become an important research topic in the discipline of international relations. Visual popular culture products can also be easily evaluated this way. States constantly reproduce their discourses in international politics through popular culture and they fix the definitions of identity representations such as terrorism, race and gender. Therefore, popular culture should also be studied as a means of producing political discourse alongside the truth built by the power. In this article, popular culture, a tool of power that produces politics on its own, will be examined in light of Maria Todorova’s balkanization concept, Balkan geography and identity. In this case, popular culture uses emotions rather politically to produce the balkanized Balkans. Emotions, through the balkanization discourse, produce Balkan identity as the other. Hence, in this article, the works of popular culture produced in the twentieth century will be analyzed periodically and it will be displayed how the Balkan identity has been constructed as a body that was first “feared” and later regarded as “embarrassing” through the discourse of balkanization.

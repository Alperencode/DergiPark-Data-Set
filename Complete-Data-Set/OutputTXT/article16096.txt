Makale Başlığı: Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Single Center Experience
Özet: Objective: Neurocutaneous syndromes are a group of diseases involving the nervous system and skin. Among them, the most common is neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The clinical course of NF1 can be heterogeneous and complex. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical features of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 followed in the Gulhane Training and Research Hospital Pediatric Neurology Outpatient Clinic.Materials and Methods: File records of 29 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 between November 2016 and March 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Family histories, demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were examined.Results: Seventeen (59%) patients were male and 12 (41%) were female. Patient ages ranged from 2 to 15.  There was a family history in 10 patients (34.4%). Genetic examination was planned in 17 of the patients, and mutations in the NF1 gene were detected in 10 (34.4%) of them. Genetic examination of seven patients had not yet been concluded. While all patients had cafe au lait spots, axillary and/or inguinal freckling was observed in 18 patients (62%). 10 patients (34.4%) had learning difficulties and cognitive disorders, 3 patients (10.3%) had epilepsy and 2 patients (6.9%) had macrocephaly. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed in 16 patients. Hyperintense lesions were detected on T2-weighted images in 9 patients (31%), ventricular enlargement in 1 patient (3.45%), cavernous hemangioma and brain stem glioma in 1 patient (3.45%). While Lisch nodule was observed in 10 patients (34.4%), optic glioma was not found in any patient. When the patients were evaluated in terms of malignancies, peripheral neurofibroma was found in 3 patients (10.3%), brain stem glioma in 1 patient (3.45%), and acute myeloid leukemia in 1 patient (3.45%). Conclusion: NF1 is a wide spectrum disease with multisystem involvement. Patients may present with very different clinical findings. Patients who presented to the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic with nonspecific neurological complaints such as macrocephaly and learning difficulties can be diagnosed with NF1 with a careful eye and skin examination. Knowing the frequency of the clinical features of the disease will help in making the diagnosis.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Neutrophil/Lymphocyte and Platelet/ Lymphocyte Ratio Values in Patients with Ischemic Stroke in Terms of Disease Severity Based on NIHSS
Özet: Aim: Stroke is the most common neurological cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, controlling the risk factors in an early phase is critically important. In this study, we aimed toinvestigate the advantages of neutrophile lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values against each other in predicting the prognosis of ischemic stroke.Material and Method: 143 ischemic stroke patients were included in to study. Blood sample analysis was done to calculate NLR and PLR. Patients’ NIHSS at first admission was also calculated.Multiple statistical analyses were used to analyze the statistical significance of NLR and PLR’s predictive power in poor prognosis.Results: We found that NLR was lower in those with a stroke scale score of 5 and below; the difference was statistically significant (p=0.015). The results of the ROC curve analysis showed that theNLR value was statistically significant in predicting patients categorized as NIHSS 6 and above (p<0.001).Conclusion: This study is one of the first in the literature to evaluate the advantages of NLR and PLR values against one another in predicting stroke prognosis. Results show that theNLR value has a higher statistical significance in predicting prognosis than the PLR value. It is believed that prospective randomized studies can draw more meaningful conclusions on a larger set of patients.

Makale Başlığı: Collective crime, reminiscence and ınterrogation in Bernhard Schlink's novel "The Reader" (Der Vorleser)
Özet: The present study has examined how the Nazi past and the Holocaust were remembered/questioned in the novel "The Reader" (Der Vorleser, 1995) by Bernhard Schlink, one of the second generation writers of German literature after World War II. In the text, the life experiences in the period of National Socialism movement were examined through the war generations, especially with the reminiscences of the second and third generations,in the background of the traumatic love story between the fifteen years old Michael and the thirty six years old Hanna. In the novel, in which the war period and aftermath are questioned with a retrospective narrative, the concept of collective crime, which is a part of German recent history, is discussed through real and fictional elements. In this study, it is explained that how the objects of memory in the collective reminiscence are fictionalized and symbolized in literature from the example of relationships of a man and a woman of war generation.

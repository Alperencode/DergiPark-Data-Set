Makale Başlığı: Interpretation of Genotype, Yield and Yield Components in Bread Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by GGE Biplot Technique and Scatter Plot Matrix
Özet: The scatter plot matrix visually presents the relationships between the examined features, the group and groups and the feature-group relationship, and provides the researchers with the convenience of making comments. This study was carried out with 10 bread wheat genotypes in the 2020-2021 growing season in Muş province, according to the Random Blocks Trial Design, under rainfed conditions. It was determined that there were significant differences between genotypes at the level of p<0.05 or p<0.01 in all traits examined, except for the number of grains per spike and number of spikelet per spike. The highest grain yield according to GGE biplot graphs; It was obtained from the G5 line with Bayraktar 2000 and Ekiz varieties. However, when evaluated in terms of all the examined features, especially; It was determined that Ekiz variety and G5 line were both stable and had high grain yield. According to scatter plot matrices; It was observed that there was a strong, linear positive relationship between the grain yield and the number of spike per square meter (r=0.9185), and between the spike yield and the spike weight (r=0.9131). As a result; It has been determined that the number of spike per square meter and spike yield are more important for selection than other components in grain yield oriented breeding programs.

Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Nonverbal Immediacy and Perception of Learning in Sports Education
Özet: In this study, it was investigated to what extent the nonverbal intimacy behaviors of the instructors affect the learning perceptions of the students. The study group of the research consisted of a total of 1308 (x̄age =22.15) students, 605 (x̄age=21.84) female and 703 (x̄age=22.42) male, studying at the sports science faculties of a university selected from seven geographical regions. "Nonverbal Immediacy Scale", "Perceived Learning Scale" and "Personal Information Form" were used as data collection tools in the research. In the analysis of data; arithmetic mean, frequency, standard deviation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis H and Spearman correlation tests were used. As a result of the data obtained in the study, the scores of women in cognitive learning and perceived learning levels in the context of gender were significantly higher than the scores of male students. At the grade level, the cognitive and perceived learning levels of the third-year students were significantly lower than the second-year students. A moderately significant correlation was determined between nonverbal intimacy scores and learning perception scores (r=,331, p< ,01). A significant but low correlation was determined between nonverbal intimacy behaviors and cognitive learning (r= ,361, p< ,01), affective learning (r= ,310, p< ,01). As a result, it can be said that as the nonverbal intimacy behaviors of the instructors increase, it has a positive effect on the learning perceptions of the students.

Makale Başlığı: The Interpretation Case on The Turkish Administrative Jurisdiction
Özet: According to the Administrative Procedure Code No. 2577, In our administrative judicial system there are two types of cases, namely the annulment proceedings and the full judicial case. However, interpretation case had the opportunity to apply as a type of case before a certain period. A separate case type in the form of a interpretation case was abolished in 1938, which was applied for 13 years in our law with the Law No. 669 on the State Law for the first time. Subsequent to the Council of State Law dated 1964 and numbered 521, theinterpretation case which were continued to be applied were abolished with the entry into force of the Administrative Procedure Code No. 2577. The interpretation case is a kind of case in the case of an administrative judicial authority by the judicial judiciary, in case a solution of the case depends on the interpretation of an administrative procedure in a case brought before a judicial review. The interpretation case has been abolished because of the lack of opportunity to practice. Due to the benefits it provides as of the period in which is applied, it is thought that this type of lawsuit should be made.

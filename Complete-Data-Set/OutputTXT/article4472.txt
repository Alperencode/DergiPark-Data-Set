Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Clinical Features and Treatment Results of Pediatric Patients With Pre-Diagnosis of COVID-19
Özet: Aim: The epidemiological characteristics and modes of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children are not yet fully understood. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings and treatment approaches in patients with negative and positive PCR tests among those with suspected COVID-19 retrospectively.Material and Methods: This study was conducted with 317 patients under 18 years of age, who received outpatient or inpatient treatment with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients were assessed for clinical course, disease severity, comorbidity, demographic characteristics, laboratory and radiodiagnostic tests, treatment characteristics, and outcomes.Results: The PCR test was positive in 133 (42%) and negative in 184 (58%) of the patients with suspected COVID-19. There was a history of contact in 78 (58.6%) and 51 (27.7%) of the PCR-positive and negative patients, respectively (p<0.001). While the PCR-negative group had a higher rate of hospitalization (p=0.020), hospital stay was longer in PCR-positive cases (p=0.037). The white blood cell count (p=0.001), platelet count (p=0.037), neutrophil count (p=0.015), and lactate level (p=0.025) were significantly lower in the PCR-positive group.Conclusion: Early detection and isolation of children with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 are important to limit the spread of the disease. It can be challenging initially to clinically understand whether the case has COVID-19, especially in pediatric patients. PCR test is the gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Considering the prevalence, severity, and complications of the outbreak, it would be a proper approach to initially evaluate suspected patients as COVID-19 patients.

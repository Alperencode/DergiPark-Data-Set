Makale Başlığı: A Qualitative Study on Family-Work and Work-Family Conflicts Experienced by Academic Mothers During the Covid-19 Pandemic
Özet: Individuals who try to balance their work-family life with limited time and limited energy may experience family-work and work-family conflicts when they have problems in this balance. The difficulties they experience while fulfilling family and work demands may cause academic mothers to experience work-family and family-work conflicts. The Covid-19 pandemic has also affected the family-work balance of academic mothers. The aim of this study is to reveal the views of academic mothers with 0-6 age group children about work-family and family-work conflict situations experienced during the pandemic process. For this purpose, this study was conducted in a qualitative research design and the data were collected with a semi-structured interview form using the interview technique. The study group consists of 13 academic mothers. The data were analyzed with the descriptive analysis technique. As a result of the analysis, four main themes were reached. These themes are; daycare/childcare, family-work conflict, work-family conflict and need of social support. As a result of the research, it was revealed that academic mothers experienced family-work conflict and work-family conflict and especially needed social support.

Makale Başlığı: THE RIGHT TO INTERROGATE A WITNESS IN THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND TURKISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT
Özet: One of the most important types of evidence used in criminal procedurelaw to reveal the material truth is the witness. Witnesses are individuals whohave acquired a certain impression by perceiving the concrete event with theirfive senses. For this reason, the statements of the witnesses about the concreteevent that they perceived with their five senses are taken. Due to the verdict ofthe accused as a result of the witness statements, the reliability of the statementsthey have given must be ensured in certain ways. The right to questionwitnesses is regulated in subparagraph d of paragraph 3 of article 6 of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). According to this regulation,the accused has the right to examine or have examined witnesses against him.As a rule, the interrogation of allegation and defence witnesses is done beforethe court. However, in some exceptional cases, witnesses cannot or do notappear before the court. In such cases, the right of the accused to a fair trial maybe violated. The European Court of Human Rights and the Constitutional Courthave set certain criteria as to whether the defendant's right to a fair trial isviolated if the witnesses are not interrogated before the court. In this study, theright to interrogate a witness is discussed in the context of the decisions givenby the European Court of Human Rights and the Turkish Constitutional Courtand in line with the criteria determined.

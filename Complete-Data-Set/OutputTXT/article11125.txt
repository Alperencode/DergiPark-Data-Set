Makale Başlığı: The Influence of Chivalry and Aristocracy on Jean Froissart's Conception of History
Özet: Jean Froissart is one of the most important names in historiography in Late Medieval Europe. In our study, after a brief analysis of his life, we will examine the stages of writing his Chronicle, which spanned a period of about forty years. We will examine this subject from various aspects, especially the motive for writing the work, the benefactors in the writing process, the physical qualities of the work and the famous illustrations in the work. One of the things that have attracted our most attention has been Froissart's work as a war correspondent and his enthusiasm to witness the events. We will investigate this subject with examples from his Chronicle. Undoubtedly, his understanding and method of historiography have been another issue that we will focus on in our study. Most importantly, the contribution of the concept of chivalry to his understanding of historiography and this is his perspective on the concept. So much so that when chivalry is mentioned in the Late Middle Ages, Froissart, who almost sanctified this concept, comes to mind. We also see this approach in some writers of that period, but Froissart has a special place here. As a matter of fact, although he was as neutral as possible in his Chronicle, he took a clear position on valor and chivalry. The general conclusion we reached in our study is that Froissart is actually a historian of honest wars beyond his definition of a historian of chivalry.

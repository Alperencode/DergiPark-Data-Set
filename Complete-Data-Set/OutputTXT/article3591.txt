Makale Başlığı: THE ATTITUDE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REGARDING THE  PEACE TREATY TO BE SIGNED WITH THE OTTOMAN STATE DURING  THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE
Özet: The Allies States expected the support of the US government in the division of Ottoman lands and in the mandate to be established on these lands at the Paris Peace Conference convened after the First World War. Although President Wilson declared that he had some doubts in the early months of the conference, his declaration that he wanted to take responsibility for the peace treaty to be signed with the Turks relieved the British and French. These two states were hoping to deal with the Eastern problem as they wished in the meeting, by leaving some problematic regions to the US mandate in sharing Anatolia. The United States sent the King-Crane Commission and General Harbord Committee to Anatolia and the Middle East in 1919 to conduct research on the sharing of Anatolia and the mandate management to be established afterwards. These delegations submitted some reports to the senate regarding the work done by the USA on getting mandate management in the region. This situation caused the postponement of the peace agreement to be signed with the Ottoman State. In addition, the refusal of the American Senate to take the mandate in line with the reports of the delegations sent to the Ottoman lands would lead the allies to change their sharing plans in Anatolia and the Middle East.

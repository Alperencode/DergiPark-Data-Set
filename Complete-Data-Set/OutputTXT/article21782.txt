Makale Başlığı: Reliability of Fitbalance Mobile Balance Measurement Device
Özet: Many methods, techniques and systems are used to determine balance performance. The aim of this study is to determine the reliability of the mobile balance device developed by Afyon Kocatepe University (Fitbalance, Turkey). Ten male elite basketball players who played in Afyon Municipality Sports Club in the 2021-2022 season in the Turkish Basketball Super League voluntarily participated in the study. The static-dynamic balance measurements of the participants were measured through  the Fitbalance system . The test and retest of static and dynamic balance evaluation results were recorded as score value (Min:0-Max:100). As the balance success increases, the score value increases. The reliability of the device was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient, coefficient of variation and Bland Altman chart. At the end of the study, it was determined that while the eyes open (0.95) and closed static (0.95) balance intraclass correlation coefficient values were high, the dynamic balance (0.72) values were moderate. In addition, the percentage of coefficient of variation was found to be moderate and acceptable for static balance eyes open (20.36%) and eyes closed (25.43%) and dynamic balance (22.87%). In addition, it has been determined that the lower and upper limits of the Bland Altman graph are narrow and the scattering is around the mean values. As a result, the portable FitBalance device can be used reliably in the absence of higher-end devices used in laboratory conditions.

Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMPLE OF EARLY TIMAR PRACTICE IN RUMELI:  KEŞAN IN THE XVth CENTURY
Özet: As a requirement of the Ottoman conquest policy, after full dominance was achieved in the conquered regions, the legal status of the lands was determined and it was determined to whom it was allocated and under what conditions. With the conquest of Rumelia, the conquered regions were given to both the military class participating in the conquest and certain individuals as a salary in return for their duty. The taxable population and lands on their lands were recorded in the tahrir books. Tahrîr registers contain financial records as well as information about the administrative and social life of city and village settlements. In this study, the district of Keşan, which is included in the icmal book of 1456, which is one of the early notebooks of the Rumeli region belonging to the period of Fatih Sultan Mehmed, is discussed. Since Keşan and its surroundings are one of the first conquered and settled regions in Rumelia, it is important in terms of giving information about the land system, military and administrative organization created in Rumeli in the early period.

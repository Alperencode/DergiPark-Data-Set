Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Irrigation Activities Implemented in Some Irrigation Associations in Yozgat Province by Water Users
Özet: In the study, the activities of six irrigation associations located in the Kızılırmak Basin Yozgat Province were evaluated through a survey conducted with water users in 2014-2015. In the surveys made with the farmers, it was seen that the water is given to the irrigation areas at the farthest distance from the dam too late and the irrigation time is not enough, the farmers are not very satisfied in terms of maintenance and repair works, and the farmers are not yet aware that their effective work together with the irrigation associations will speed up the work. It has been determined that the farmers in the irrigation area have not received any training on irrigation in recent years. In addition, in cases where irrigation water is insufficient, the majority of water users stated that they use limited irrigation according to their own experience, and nearly half of the farmers stated that they do not use a specific method when deciding on the irrigation time. In this context, evaluation studies of irrigation association activities should be continued in order to provide the expected benefit from irrigation projects and for an effective water management, and deficiencies should be determined according to the results and problems should be resolved.

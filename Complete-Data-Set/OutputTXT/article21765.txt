Makale Başlığı: Insecticide resistance status of Bemisia tabaci (Genn., 1889) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) populations to cyantraniliprole, pyriproxyfen and spirotetramat in Antalya (Türkiye)
Özet: In the study, the susceptibility of twelve Bemisia tabaci (Genn., 1889) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) MEAM1 and MED populations collected from tomato and pepper greenhouses in Antalya Province (Türkiye) in 2019 and 2020 to spirotetramat, pyriproxyfen and cyantraniliprole were determined. To determine the lethal concentrations (LC50) for the populations, spirotetramat and pyriproxyfen were applied using leaf dipping method to second instar and eggs, respectively, while a systemic uptake method was used for testing the susceptibility of whitefly instars to cyantraniliprole. The resistance ratios were calculated by dividing the LC50 of the populations by the LC50 of a susceptible population. The LC50 of the populations ranged from 0.28 to 1.70x103 mg a.i./l for pyriproxyfen, from 1.76 to 228 mg a.i./l for spirotetramat, and from 0.103 to 0.382 mg a.i./l for cyantraniliprole. Resistance ratios for pyriproxyfen were particularly high. For spirotetramat and cyantraniliprole resistance varied between 2.38 and 309, and 4.68 to 17.4 times, respectively. All populations were susceptible to cyantraniliprole, but some populations highly resistance to pyriproxyfen and spirotetramat. The results will be a valuable reference for future monitoring and management of insecticide resistance.

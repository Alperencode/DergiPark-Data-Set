Makale Başlığı: The Discovery of The Landscape in My Name Red, An Epic Paintin Book
Özet: Kojin Karatani, objects to the thought of western and modernity as the same, and tries to discover the origins of modern literature in the modernization phase of the non-westerner. Since the second half of the 19th century, with the emergence of nation-states, changes in the political sense have been reflected in literature. Kojin Karatani, who deals with literature through a modern perspective, explains this by going down to the roots of “landscape”, “inwardness”, “confession”, “children” and “disease”. Karatani examines these concepts with subjects such as painting and religion, and examines the “depth of the landscape” from this point of view. In the article, Orhan Pamuk's novel My Name is Red will be examined through these concepts of Karatani, the discovery of landscape and inwardness will be explained by taking into account the fact that the book itself is a modern landscape.

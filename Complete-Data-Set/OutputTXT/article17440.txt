Makale Başlığı: DRUG USE AND TERATOGENITY IN PREGNANCY
Özet: The pharmacokinetic properties of many drugs change due to the physiological changes shaped on the pregnant animals during pregnancy, so it is necessary to regulate the dosage regimen in pregnant. In addition, the existence of teratogenic effects of some drugs on the fetus or embryo limits the use of drugs in pregnant. Risk classification systems constituted to prevent these risks guide physicians. However, since these classification systems are not suitable for all species, their use is limited in the field of veterinary medicine and can provide an estimate for veterinarians about the harmful effects it may cause in other species. In this review, it is aimed to specify drug use, teratogenic drugs and their effects in pregnant, and also to guide veterinarians about drug use in pregnant patients.

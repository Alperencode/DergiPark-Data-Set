Makale Başlığı: An Appraisal on Military History Works of Ali Fuad Erden
Özet: This article is an assessment of the works of Ali Fuad Erden, a late era prominent Ottoman officer, on military history. Ali Fuad Erden, who published his works in three different eras of Abdulhamid II, Young Turks, Republican, used didactic approach in narration as his aim was pragmatic: to educate young, modern Ottoman officers. Thanks to his knowledge on several European languages, he could examine the wars multilaterally, from different perspectives. It should be noted that Ali Fuad Erden did not cite verbatim his sources, but instead he corrected them when it is necessary. Wars were discussed in his books comprehensively; from military preparations to combats, to outcomes. As the aim was pragmatic, he included his remarks both within the text and in separate sections.Although the author did not write his memories about the Syrian front with the same pragmatic goal, methods applied in that book were the same. He emphasized in all hisworks the importance of the knowledge and skills of commanders, tactical maneuvers in combats, so the education of officer corps. The examination of Ali Fuad Erden’s worksis beneficial both for studying the related wars, and tracing the development of military history studies from the late Ottoman to the Republican periods.

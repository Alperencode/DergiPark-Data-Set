Makale Başlığı: A Review of International Standard Principles Used for Cataloging and Classification in Film Archives
Özet: Film archives are important in terms of both the cultural heritage of the countries and the history of cinema. There are films that are destroyed as a result of not giving the film archives the importance they deserve and not being built according to international standards. This article aims to investigate the studies on film archiving in Turkey and in the world from the perspective of librarianship with the method of documentary source analysis. During the research, it was seen that one of the most fundamental problems of film archiving is the studies on cataloging and classification of films. In order for a film to be easily accessible in the archive and to ensure its national/international visibility, it must be cataloged and classified in accordance with standard principles and essentials. Therefore, in this study, international standard principles that can be used for cataloging and classification of films were examined. In the analysis, it has been determined that the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) are the institutions that carry out the most comprehensive study in this field. CEN and FIAF have various commissions made up of subject experts from their member countries. In the study, the international standard principles and essentials used in the cataloging and classification of films, based on the documents produced by these commissions, have been put forward.

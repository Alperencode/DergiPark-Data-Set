Özet: The human has not been intimated the dog as only a behavioral during its domestication journey, but also many diseases have become to live together. Long-term, expensive and highly controlled experimental animal models are created for biomedical research. Instead of this, the use of naturally diseased dogs in the framework of ethical and deontological rules will facilitate understanding the physiopathological mechanisms of genetic diseases in both human and animal medicine. Thus, new gene and cell therapy options will be enabled. In this review, was aimed to give information, whose desired to do translational research, about canine neurogenetic diseases likely as humans.

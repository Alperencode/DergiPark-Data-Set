Makale Başlığı: THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS AND PAYBACK PERIOD INVESTIGATION OF POWER TURBINE GENERATOR FOR MARINE DIESEL ENGINES
Özet: Because of the heat flow and temperature, marine diesel engine exhaust gas energy is by far the highest desirable among the waste heat sources of a ship. Waste heat recovery systems generate electrical power by using this exhaust gas energy. The goal of this study is to measure how much the power turbine generator improves the system's efficiency for 3 different engine loads and 3 different ambient conditions. This study presents a power turbine generator using a six-cylinder low-speed marine diesel engine. Analyses are performed by considering three different ambient conditions and three different diesel engine loads, and the exergy destruction of each component, exergy efficiency, exergy destruction rate, efficiency increases, and power output of the system is calculated. Besides that, the payback period is calculated according to the installation cost of the power turbine generator and the cost of the fuel saved annually. Based on the analysis, the highest power output for the power turbine generator occurred under 100% engine operating load and winter ambient conditions, and the lowest power output occurred under 75% engine operating load and tropical ambient conditions. On the other hand, for the same ambient conditions, the highest efficiency increase occurred at 90% engine operating load, and the lowest efficiency increase occurred at 100% engine operating load. In the power turbine generator, it is observed that the shortest payback period is 100% engine operating load and winter ambient condition.

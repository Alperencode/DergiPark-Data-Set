Makale Başlığı: Memduh Şevket Esendal's Tour of Eastern Anatolıa
Özet: CHP is a party that has been influential in Turkish politics since its inception. During its management, it gave importance to observation, examination and inspection in order to identify social problems, to keep the pulse of the people and not to break her ties with the people. For this purpose, party leaders organized long-term study tours to different parts of the country. The trips made have been very important in solving the problems for places where there is no party organization. In this context, CHP General Secretary Memduh Şevket Esendal went on a tour to the Eastern provinces on 7 September 1942. One of the aims of the mentioned trip is to make up for this deficiency in the provinces that do not have a party organization and to ensure that they take place within the unity of the country. Another aim is to determine the effects of drought and sunn pest damage on the agriculture of the region in situ. Thus, it is to help the government in the policies to be followed. The report prepared by Memduh Şevket Esendal was received by the Chief Clerk on 14 June 1945 to be included in the file after he left his post as Secretary General. Esendal, who detailed his observations in this report, gave detailed information about the administrative, social, economic, demographic, cultural, ethnic and linguistic structure of the region. In this study, these problems that Şevket Esendal identified in the Eastern Anatolian provinces were discussed and his views on different provinces were revealed.

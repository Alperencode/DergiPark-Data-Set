Makale Başlığı: A hybrid ABC - Spherical Fuzzy AHP - ELECTRE group decision making method for stock management and an application.
Özet: In today's economic conditions, the reduction of inventory costs of enterprises is one of the important factors that lead to a decrease in production costs and increase in competitiveness. The aim of this study is to prevent stock deficits and surpluses that may occur by designing an applicable and effective raw material-stock management system. For this purpose, stock analyzes were made by using ABC, Spherical Fuzzy AHP and ELECTRE methods and an algorithm with four steps was proposed. In the first step, units were classified by using ABC analysis based on the unit price and demand quantities. In the second step, the Spherical Fuzzy AHP method was used. Here, criteria such as the availability of the product, 	substitutability, the delivery time of the order, and the effect of the product prices from currency fluctuations are discussed. These criteria have been evaluated together with business managers and engineers responsible for production and the criterion weights have been calculated with a group decision making approach. In the third step, by using the criterion weights in the ELECTRE method, the products are sorted and grouped according to this order. In the last step, the results obtained from ABC and SF-AHP - ELECTRE were combined and an evaluation scale was obtained. Within the scope of this study, an application of the proposed method for the furniture industry is included.

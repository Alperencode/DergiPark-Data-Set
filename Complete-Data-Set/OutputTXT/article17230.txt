Makale Başlığı: The system of the soul and heart and its relationship to acclamation
Özet: With the technical development and paradigm shift of the era of science, atom, space and discoveries, and with the progress of research in medicine and human sciences, the system that governs human behavior and perception is still unknown until now. And his behavior, so there was an urgent need to talk about the logical explanation of that system or the body that governs human behavior from the point of view of the sciences of religion and Sharia.This research deals with the definition of the set of moral elements that make up the human being and their relationship to each other in how to influence behavior, its patterns and variables, and the actions and behaviors that emerge from it.The researcher shed light on a number of important elements that make up the human entity, including: the soul, the soul, the heart, the body, and he defined the moral elements based on the descriptive analytical approach, as well as the deductive approach in some texts of the Holy Qur’an and the purified prophetic hadiths. In the results of the research, the researcher reached an abstract formulation of that legal system that leads man and is responsible for his behavior and actions.

Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Sukuk and Economic Growth: A case study in Turkey
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between sukuk issued by participation banks and economic growth in Turkey.Method: In this paper, Engle-Granger co-integration and Grenger causality approaches were used as methods. The sukuk issued by all participation banks operating in Turkey and real GDP figures have been analyzed for the period of 2013Q4-2021Q3. Findings: As a result of the Engle-Granger co-integration test, long-term statistically significant co-integration relationship was not found between the issuance of sukuk and real GDP. However, according to the Grenger causality test results, a one-way Grenger causality relationship from real GDP to sukuk issuances was found.Implications: According to the results of this paper, there is no co-integration relationship between the sukuk issued by participation banks and economic growth in Turkey. In other words, it was concluded that there is no long-term equilibrium relationship between the variables. In addition, the one-way Grenger causality relationship determined from economic growth to sukuk issuance shows that participation banks cannot contribute to economic growth with the sukuk instrument, on the contrary, they benefit from economic growth. The results of the study are in the opposite direction of the expected results.Originality: The originality of this study is that it is the first study to examine the relationship between variables in the context of Turkey using the Engle-Grenger co-integration and Grenger causality approach.

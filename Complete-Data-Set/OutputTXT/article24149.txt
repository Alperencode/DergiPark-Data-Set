Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Environmental Challenges of Jordan
Özet: Rapid population growth and urbanization and the Jordan's economic crisis and industrialization are significant contributors to natural resource depletion and the worsening of environmental problems. The country's environmental issues need to be discussed on local, regional, and global scales. The country's current ecological issues are evaluated in this study and the institutional organization and political response that the Jordanian government has attempted to address is further discussed. The theoretical methods used through this process included examining all aspects of the problems set out, examining the current environmental issues within the context of regulations in Jordan. In addition analyses were conducted to satisfy the population's need to achieve environmental sustainability taking into account the importance and effectiveness of regional strategies in preserving and sustaining natural resources. Pollution or loss of natural resources have significant implications for Jordan. Environmental protection is a humanitarian responsibility because it is the basis of our livelihood, development, and survival.  As a result, preservation of the environment must become part of the citizens' culture with state and private institutions promoting its importance in their lives in the country.

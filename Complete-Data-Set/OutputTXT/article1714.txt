Makale Başlığı: Status of benthic cover in Carbin Reef, Sagay Marine Reserve, Western Visayas, the Philippines
Özet: This study determined the status of Carbin Reef benthic cover, Sagay Marine Reserve, Negros Occidental. The underwater benthic assessment was conducted on March 2019 by laying eight 50-meter transect lines at the depths of 6 meters (crest) and 12 meters (slope). Photo-quadrat method was used in obtaining still benthic images for every 1-m across eight 50-meter transect lines. A total of 400 still images were acquired and analyzed using Coral Point Count with Excel Extension (CPCe). The sedimentation rate was also determined by deploying sediment collectors. Results showed that Carbin Reef is characterized by 26.09% live coral cover and 43.25% abiotic structure such as rocks, sand, and coral rubbles. Fifty-five (55) coral species belonging to thirty-three (33) genera were identified, dominated by Porites, Fungia, and Goniastrea. Throughout the area, Porites lobata was the most dominant coral species. The overall hard coral cover seemed to have decreased since 2014. Further analysis showed the prevalence of bleached corals and diseases such as white syndrome, and white band disease. Similarly, two signs of compromised health including sediment damage and competition overgrowth were also present. The sedimentation rate per day was below the maximum tolerable levels by most corals during dry season. Overall, this study presents the first extensive study of coral diversity in Carbin Reef–characterized by a moderately diverse area and considered as a moderately stressed habitat.

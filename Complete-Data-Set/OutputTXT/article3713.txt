Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Deficit Irrigation on Yield and Quality of Second Crop Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)
Özet: This study was carried out in Bursa, Turkey which has a sub-humid climate, in order to examine the water-yield relationships and responses of yield and quality components under deficit irrigation of second crop sesame plant (Sesamum indicum L.) irrigated with drip irrigation method. Experimental treatments were application of 100% (S1), 75% (S2), 50% (S3), 25% (S4) and 0% (S5) of soil water depleted at effective rooting depth at 7-day intervals. The experiment was applied in 3 replicates according to the completely randomized blocks experimental design. According to the study results, the total amounts of irrigation water applied were between 127.0-354.7 mm. Crop evapotranspiration values varied between 246.0-449.5 mm. Seed yield, oil content and protein content were obtained as between 76.3-189.2 kg da-1, 56.3-62.6% and 18.6-20.4%, respectively. In the study, the seasonal yield response factor (ky) was determined as 1.28. Water use efficiency (WUE) of the sesame plant was found between 0.31-0.43 kg m-3. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) varied between 0.50-0.57 kg m-3. As a result, irrigation treatment S1 can be suggested as an irrigation schedule in order to reach the highest seed yield (189.2 kg da-1) in the second crop sesame plant. When water resources are limited, taking into account the WUE and IWUE values, the S2 treatment (25% water deficit) can be preferred as an irrigation program in terms of water saving.

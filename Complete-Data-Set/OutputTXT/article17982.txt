Makale Başlığı: The Effect On The Physical Properties Of The Fabric In Differences Composition And Construction At Sustainable Fabric Design
Özet: The management of textile wastes, which has an important share in rapidly growing environmental problems, is increasing its importance day by day. In accordance with this, companies are working on re-evaluation of waste before disposal, sustainable fabric design and production. The increasing awareness of sustainability among consumers on a global scale is also effective in the orientation of companies to these studies. In this study, the effects of the use of recycled yarn in woven fabric composition and the changes in this amount (ratio) on the physical properties of the fabric were investigated. Also; In the production of fabric with recycled yarns, the effects of the use of different weaves on the physical properties of the fabric is another subject investigated in the study. As a result of the studies, it was concluded that in the production of sustainable fabrics along with recycled yarns, the knitting types to be selected at the design stage, the fabric structures and yarn compositions to be created accordingly are effective in improving the recyclable fabric properties, and if these choices are made correctly, the physical properties of the fabrics can be optimized.

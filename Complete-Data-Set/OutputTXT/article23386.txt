Makale Başlığı: Comparison of some microbiological properties of traditional kefir and commercial kefir
Özet: In recent years, due to the increase in the number of conscious consumers, the interest in kefir, which is a probiotic fermented milk drink with an immune-boosting effect, has increased. Kefir production from kefir grains with the traditional method is not possible on a commercial scale. For this reason, starter cultures are used in the production of commercial kefir. In this study, some microbiological properties of commercially produced fruit, plain and lactose-free kefir samples sold in Kırşehir and kefir produced from traditional kefir grains were compared. Microbiological (total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeast-mold, coliform, E. coli) and chemical analyzes (pH) of kefir samples were performed. It has been determined that bacterial counts in all kefir varieties examined are in accordance with the Turkish Food Codex Communique on Fermented Milk Products. Compared to commercially produced kefir, the number of live bacteria per milliliter of kefir produced by the traditional method was found to be higher. Although the results obtained show that the consumption of kefir produced by the traditional method may be more beneficial, generalization should not be made due to the small number of samples. In the next study, it is thought that a more comprehensive study will be carried out by increasing the number of samples.

Makale Başlığı: A Mythıcal Analysıs Of The Poem Kara Toprak By Âşık Veysel
Özet: Myths, which are known as the first sample/prototype, constitute the origin of cultures. This symbolic construct that aims to explain multiple phenomena by harboring them is intertwined with cultures and reflects the way of understanding the universe held by the nation to which it belongs in ancient ages. This multilayer construct, which attempts to attribute meaning to everything by integration with the effort of the primitive man to understand the universe and is perceived as the truth, has developed in parallel with the human feeling of curiosity. The person, who wants to internalize and get integrated with the universe based on this feeling of curiosity and the desire of the ancient man to know, believes that all creation around him has a soul. Myths, which are discussed not only verbally but also functionally with their process of explaining events and attributing meaning to events in the context of getting to their core, are encountered in folkloric products in the form of symbols and shapes. Accordingly, in the poem “Kara Toprak [Black Earth/Soil] by Âşık Veysel, who is one of the unforgettable masters of the âşıklık [bardship] poetry tradition, the soil is not only seen as the essence but also endowed with a functional identity. This study aims to provide a mythical point of view for the poem Kara Toprak by Âşık Veysel.

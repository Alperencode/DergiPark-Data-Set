Makale Başlığı: IRAQI POET SA'DI YUSUF AND THE LASTING FOR THE LOST HOMELAND
Özet: Political and social developments after the Second World War triggered migration from underdeveloped countries to developed countries. This wave of migration caused by political, social and economic concerns has undoubtedly been reflected in literature in different ways. Due to political and social pressures and restrictions on freedom of thought and expression, well-known poets and writers from some Arab countries to Europe and the United States emigrated and continued their literary activities in these countries. One of them is Sa'dî Yûsuf, an Iraqi poet and writer who travelled from Baghdad to London at a young age and settled there and recently died abroad. In this study, we tried to examine the expatriate life of Sa'dî Yûsuf, one of the recent Arab poets, writers and intellectuals, with examples from his poems.

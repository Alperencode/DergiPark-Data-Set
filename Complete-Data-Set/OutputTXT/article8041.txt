Özet: Urban identity which differentiates one city from another and expresses the entire features and phenomenon enriching the city contains many variables. Archaeological structure of the city, cultural, natural, and social characteristics it bears are the primary ones of these variables. Cities take an active role in becoming important places in every aspect over time and with the changing city structures, and it is seen that the competition between the cities is on the rise. However, at this point, there are important issues regarding differentiation of urban identities. Globalization has complicated formation of unique identity of the cities which seem to be standardized and equipped with monotype buildings besides their benefits. Apart from their great scale effects, cities which have substantially affected individual lives in small-scale have been losing the claim of possessing different characteristics. As a consequence of disappearance of the individuals’ sense of belonging to the city they live in or not having this kind of sense from the beginning, it can be seen that alienation phenomenon appears in individual lives. In this study which emphasizes the necessity of focusing on effects of globalization on the city besides its effects on individual and social lives, the concept of urban identity is assessed from globalization perspective.

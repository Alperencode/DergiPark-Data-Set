Makale Başlığı: A Group of Gems with Isis-Tyche Depictions from Ankara
Özet: This  study  evaluates  13  intaglio  engraved  ring  stones  from  Ankara  through  their  iconographic  features.  These  artifacts  come  from  the  collections  of  the  Ankara  Museum of Anatolian Civilizations and the Erimtan Archaeology and Art Museum. The artifacts contain depictions of Isis and Isis-Tyche. Isis is known one of the chief goddesses in the ancient Egyptian belief system. When examining the iconography, more examples are encountered of the goddess depicted with her son Harpocrates and  her  husband  Osiris  However,  due  to  the  close  cultural  relations  that  were  established  over  time,  Isis  was  observed  to  have  been  combined  with  different  goddesses  from  the  Greek  and  Roman  worlds.  One  of  these  goddesses  is  Tyche,  the goddess of luck and fate. Isis and Tyche are depicted as integrated on the ring stones and amulets discussed here. In other words, the depictions are of Isis-Tyche. This study examines the ways in which the goddess Isis had developed an eclectic form  with  the  new  features  she  gained  from  the  pantheon  of  the  Greco-Roman  world and how she was depicted as being integrated with other goddesses. Ring stones  with  depiction  of  Isis-Tyche  were  used  as  personal  seals  in  the  Roman  Imperial Period, as well as being and were also believed to bring the wearer good health and protection from bad luck.

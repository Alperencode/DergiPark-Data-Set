Makale Başlığı: PREVALENCE OF PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE IN PATIENTS WITH AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS
Özet: Introduction and Aim: Premature ovarian failure is the loss of function of the ovaries under the age of forty that autoimmunity is a factor in some cases. Anti-Müllerian hormone is secreted by the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles. Ovarian reserve can be accurately assessed with AMH measurements. This study aimed to evaluate the ovarian reserve by Anti-Müllerian hormone level in women who were diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis.Methods: This is a retrospective study, covers the 10-year period between January 2011 and May 2021. Women under the age of 35 who were followed up and treated for autoimmune thyroiditis constitute the sample of the study. Participants' ovarian reserves were analyzed using age specific AMH levels. Thyroid hormone levels were measured in the radioimmunoassay laboratory in the health center where the study was conducted.  Results: Some participants did not have infertility (66.6%). 147 (38.7%) of the participants were euthyroid. 197 participants (51.8%) had a low ovarian reserve, 229 (60.3%) of the participants had high anti-TPO and 217 (57.2%) had high anti-TG levels. Participants with low ovarian reserve show a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of thyroid hormone analysis results (p<0.05).Conclusions: It was determined that the participants with hypothyroidism had a lower mean AMH and ovarian reserve compared to the other groups.

Makale Başlığı: Survival Time of Listeria monocytogenes During Maturation in Herbed Cheese
Özet: This research was carried out to determine the viability of L. monocytogenes during ripening in Herby cheeses produced experimentally from raw milk contaminated with different levels of L. monocytogenes strains identified from Herby cheese samples collected from the Van market. Two area and one reference L. monocytogenes strain, which were identified from the samples and verified in Real-time PCR, were added to the milk at the levels of 101, 103 and 105 cfu/ml. Herby cheeses produced by adding L. monocytogenes were matured in brine for 90 days and the survival times of L. monocytogenes and the microbiological and chemical changes in the cheese were investigated. L. monocytogenes numbers were different in experimental herby cheese groups and could not be isolated in some groups from the 50th day of ripening. In the analyzes after the 75th day of maturation, L. monocytogenes could not be detected in any group.

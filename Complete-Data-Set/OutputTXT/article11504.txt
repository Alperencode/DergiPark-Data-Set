Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF EXPERIENTIAL VALUES ON CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: BURDUR MAKU LAVANTA TEPESI HOTEL EXAMPLE
Özet: Nowadays, businesses need to create unique and remarkable experiences that can provide customers with products, services and activities in this intense competitive environment. Businesses need to manage the experiential value elements that determine perceptions in the evaluation of products, services or activities to this end. The aim of this study is to examine experiential value dimension’s effect on customer satisfaction. The customers accommodating in Burdur MAKU Lavanta Tepesi Hotel, which is the only five-star hotel serving in the province of Burdur, constituted the study sample. 156 customers were reached with the convenience sampling technique. During the data analysis process, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were performed on the data collected by the questionnaire technique. The main results obtained in the study concluded that hotel customers' experiential value perceptions have a significant effect on customer satisfaction and that when customers' experiential value perceptions increase, so do customer satisfaction levels. In line with this result, accommodation businesses are recommended to determine their marketing strategies by taking the experiential value and application sub-dimensions into account. In this way, accommodation businesses will be able to ensure that their customers are satisfied.

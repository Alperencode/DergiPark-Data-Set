Makale Başlığı: Problems and Suggestion in the Use of Constructed Wetland Treatment Systems for the Treatment of Domestic Wastewater
Özet: Sustainable wastewater management practise should be related to low capital cost and low energy consumption, and low mechanical technology requirements. For the treatment of domestic wastewater, it is of great importance to develop appropriate technologies that are simple, have no complex equipment, have economic value and can be used with outputs, and have low initial investment and operating costs. Therefore, wetlands can be technical alternatives to other treatment systems, especially for small communities, due to low costs, low maintenance and easy to operate. Constructed Wetland has been described as low water depth, vegetation and the use of soils, mimic those found in natural wetland ecosystems. Wastewater treatment take places in the system with various biological chemical and physical processes involving plants, sunlight water, microorganisms and soil. The existing constructed wetlands treatment systems in our country cannot be operated efficiently or are not in working condition due to various problems made during the projecting, construction and operation phases. As a general solution to the problems encountered in constructed wetlands treatment systems, a detailed and careful project design phase, a construction phase carried out in accordance with the project file, and the operation phase where the necessary analyzes, observations and improvements are carried out will prevent the emergence of many problems. This paper focuses on describing the constructed wetlands, advantage and disadvantages, design and operation problems and design approach for wastewaters.

Makale Başlığı: A Conceptual Overlook at the Safety Management System
Özet: The most important rule that does not change in the aviation industry, which naturally faces many dangers compared to other sectors, is safety. It is often not possible to compensate for the insecurity that causes devastating effects in terms of its consequences. This situation has made the concept of safety one of the most emphasized concepts throughout the history of aviation. The main purpose in aviation operations is to minimize the risks that cannot be eliminated but exist in every activity. Aviation enterprises, which continue their existence with this awareness, must integrate a common system developed to ensure safety. This system, which is called the “Safety Management System (SMS)”, should be carried out with an understanding that should be adopted by all personnel, not by a single person and unit. The importance of a sound safety management system depends on the recognition and application of all aspects of this system. In this context, the concept of safety in the study, followed by the approach of the safety management system, is discussed together with its historical processes. As a result of the literature review on the subject, the safety management system was conceptually examined, and suggestions were made that would be beneficial to both sector employees and researchers.

Makale Başlığı: Navroz K. DUBASH, India in a Warming World: Integrating Climate Change and Development
Özet: In India climate change claims lives, spreads diseases and destroys livelihoods due to the country’s geographical exposure and low preparedness. Extreme poverty and inequality further exacerbate these impacts. However, India is a country of 1.4 billion people, with a dependency on oil and gas imports for urgent developmental needs. It is a growing economy but its historical responsibility towards climate change is very low.1 These features make India an invigorating case for studying climate change. India in a Warming World: Integrating Climate Change and Development, edited by Navroz K. Dubash, is an excellent book covering various aspects of climate change in an Indian context. It is an engaging book providing a rich discussion about the multifaceted features of climate change. As an open access book from Oxford University Press and with a holistic approach incorporating science, politics, and the policy of climate change, it provides an accessible and valuable source for academics, policy-makers and students working on climate change.

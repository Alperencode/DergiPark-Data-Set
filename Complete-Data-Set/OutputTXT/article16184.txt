Makale Başlığı: The Connection of the Name Rāfiza with Shiite Thought and Imāmiyya
Özet: In this article, which investigates the connection of the name Rāfiza with Shiite thought and Imāmiyya, it is pointed out that the meanings of "rejection", "abandonment" and "separation" in the word rafz, from which the name in question is derived, are compatible with Shia and Imāmiyya. In this context, based on the narrations about the origin of the name Rāfiza given to them by their opponents, this name has two different meanings in general and specifically: it is an umbrella name used for Shia, which bases the imamate on tex and appointment after the Prophet, and in a special sense, it is emphasized that it is the nickname of Imāmiyya al-Isnāashariyya, who systematizes this thought as the belief of twelve imams and counts it as one of the foundations of religion and faith. In the narrations they quoted from their imams that this name was given to them by Allah, not by their opponents, their efforts to channel the negative meaning of the name Rāfiza into a positive direction as abandoning the evil and turning to the good are presented as proofs that they embraced this name by praising them.

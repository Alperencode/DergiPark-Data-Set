Özet: To perform basic functions correctly in health services, healthcare employees need to carry out effective knowledge-sharing activities. Therefore, knowledge management is as important as other assets and resources for the survival and success of the organization the aim of this study is to define the main reasons that lead to barriers to knowledge sharing for nursing and whether there is a relationship between knowledge management performance and knowledge sharing barriers. The descriptive and correlational study was conducted on 562 nurses who work in university hospital. The data were collected using descriptive information form, Information Management Process Performance Evaluation Scale, Knowledge-Sharing Barriers Scale. There was a positive, low power and statistically very significant correlation between the knowledge management process performance evaluation of nurses and knowledge-sharing barriers (r = .358; p˂.001). Additionally, the knowledge-sharing barriers were mainly correlated with the “information sharing” subdimension (r=.349; p˂.001), while the knowledge management process performance was mainly correlated with the technological barrier subdimension (r=.287; p˂.001). Based on the review, that knowledge-sharing barriers were knowledge management of nurses in healthcare organizations. It is evident that knowledge management and sharing are significant areas for future research in health services.

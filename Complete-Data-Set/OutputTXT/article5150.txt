Makale Başlığı: International Mechanisms in The Enforcement Of International Humanitarian Law
Özet: One of the biggest obstacles in ensuring international peace and security and protecting human rights is armed conflicts. The protection of persons who have never participated in or been out of conflict during armed conflict is regulated in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols to the Conventions of 1977, which constitute international humanitarian law. International mechanisms are envisaged in the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols for the better functioning of the system of protection introduced to secure the rights of the persons in question. In the contemporary world order, where the use of force is prohibited, both international and national armed conflicts continue to exist. The mechanisms that can be used and applied for the implementation of international humanitarian law during these conflicts should be better understood and these mechanisms should be made operational.

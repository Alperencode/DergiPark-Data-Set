Makale Başlığı: Ibn al-Qatta' as-Siqilli and His Work Titled al-Durra al-Khatîra on the 900th Anniversary of His Death
Özet: Ibnu'l-Qatta‘ al-Siqilli (d. 515/1121) is one of the leading historians and poets of his time as well as being a scholar of Arabic language and literature. He was born and raised in Sicily, which was the first piece of island land that the Muslims captured from the Byzantines. Since his father and grandfather were linguists and poets, he received a good education from a young age. He has written many works. These works are important in terms of showing his rich knowledge. Examining his work named al-Durra al-Khatîra, which is the subject of this article, will contribute in terms of reflecting the poetry accumulation of the period. Because Ibnu'l-Qatta‘ gives important information about the poets of the period and their understanding of poetry in his work. In particular, he introduces the poets who grew up in Sicily and their poems as a linguist and poet, and reflects them to the present day as a historian. Although it is stated in Mu'camu al-Udabâ that there are 20,000 couplets with the biographies of 170 Sicilian poets in this work, it has been determined that there are approximately 1791 couplets together with the biographies of 106 poets in al-Durra al-Khatîra, which has reached our time. This huge gap between them raises many questions. The effect of this work is clearly seen in later works such as Kharîdatu'l-Qasr. In this case, the reasons why the work could not reach us completely is another issue that this article discusses.

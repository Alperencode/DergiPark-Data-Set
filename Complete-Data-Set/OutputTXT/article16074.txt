Makale Başlığı: The effects of entomopathogenic fungi on plant growth and occurrence of disease on plants
Özet: Entomopathogenic fungi are used as biocontrol agents against plant pests. However, recent studies showed that they could also be effective in controlling plant pathogens, either directly or indirectly. Direct effects are related to three mechanisms of antagonism; I) parasitism, II) competition for energy sources around the host plant, and III) production of metabolites that suppress pathogen growth. In addition, they indirectly affect pathogens via their positive interactions with plants. Entomopathogenic fungi in endophytic relationships with plants may decrease the susceptibility of plants to pathogens by facilitating their growth and inducing their defense mechanisms. In this review, the direct and indirect effects of entomopathogenic fungi on plant growth and disease occurrence on plants are discussed. Increased knowledge on this subject can contribute to the use of biocontrol agents becoming more widespread, particularly entomopathogenic fungi, for the control of plant diseases. This review also discusses the subject in the context of current literature because it is important to draw attention to the use of biopesticides, not only against pests, but also against plant pathogens.

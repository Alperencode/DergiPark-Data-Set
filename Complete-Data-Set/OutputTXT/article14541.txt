Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Participatory Planning in Housing Design: The Example of Baku
Özet: Participatory planning is an approach to designing active, livable cities that make urban planning accessible, community-focused and enjoyable. It is based on the belief that blending local knowledge with specialist knowledge leads to powerful results. Therefore, this paper describes a conceptual participatory design framework for urban planning that integrates various forms of existing knowledge and provides enhanced support for stakeholder engagement in urban planning. This study offers ideas and suggestions for the implementation of similar workshops aimed at increasing the success of participatory planning processes. The research methodology is based on an integrated approach to the problem under consideration, which consists in systematizing the normative legal acts of cities adopted by local governments within the framework of current legislation, analyzing their impact on urban planning activities, investment climate and environment. One of the main research methods is the experimental design method. The study is based on practical design and rule-making studies carried out in Baku, Azerbaijan.

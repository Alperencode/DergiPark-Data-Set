Makale Başlığı: DEMOGRAPHY AND POPULATION POLICIES OF TURKEY FROM THE OTTOMAN STATE TO THE PRESENT: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Özet: Population, which is the basic element of social structure, naturally expresses the starting point of social sciences. The concept of wealth, which has different meanings in different periods of history, has now been measured through the concept of "human". Countries define their wealth with their qualified human resources. Today, it has become a necessity to deal with the changing physical and social structure of the population, namely demography, for production, growth and development. Demography is a resource that should be considered for all future visions that countries will set. The importance of population perspectives is undeniable when setting future goals. Population is directly related to areas with socio-economic characteristics, especially in areas such as education, health, social security. The rapidly increasing human population makes the primary task of "allocating scarce resources to people with unlimited needs", which is the dead end of the economic institution, increasingly difficult. In the face of the increasing population, especially the income distribution debates, the demand for fair administration and access has pushed the states to develop new strategies and policies. Population policies have brought along new theoretical debates and led to the emergence of a number of alternative theories. In this study, population movements from the Ottoman Empire to the present day, Turkey's demographic history and population policies are examined.

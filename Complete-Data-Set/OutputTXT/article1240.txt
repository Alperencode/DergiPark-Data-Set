Makale Başlığı: Determination of the activities of some wildlife (Classis: Mammalia) in different forest stands on Ilgaz Mountain
Özet: Ilgaz Mountain is the ecotone region from Central Anatolia steppe to Black Sea forests. These areas contain both various vegetations and forest stands and fauna together with the effect of topography and climate. It is very important to reveal the wildlife changes depending on the changes in the existing forests structure. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship of different stand structures on wildlife. For this purpose, monitoring was carried out by camera traps for 210 days in 9 different sample areas. As a result of the study, 12 different species of mammals were identified. The most recorded species in the area were wild boar and hare. The least recorded species are jackal, fox, hedgehog and beech marten. Hares, bears and wolves were seen in the stand closest to the settlement and where the highest agricultural areas are located. On the other hand, deer and roe deer preferred the Scots pine and Fir stands, which are the farthest from the settlement and with high closure. The results of the study showed that Ilgaz forests have a healthy forest structure, considering the species diversity and population densities.

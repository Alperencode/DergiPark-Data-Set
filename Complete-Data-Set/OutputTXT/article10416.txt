Makale Başlığı: Reflections on the Benefits of a Regional Development-Oriented University in Maritime: The Case of Tuzla Region
Özet: As universities gain new roles and expectations from them increase, they are transforming to meet them. One of the expectations that has emerged in recent years is that universities should contribute to regional and global development. In order to respond to this expectation, universities have started to engage in various activities, thus helping to revitalize economic, social, and cultural life in their regions. In parallel, some universities in Turkey have been identified as regional development-oriented universities. In this study, the contributions of regional development-oriented universities to their regions are examined in the maritime context and the contributions that a maritime-oriented university with a similar mission can make to the region are discussed. Then, all findings are analyzed under the assumption that a university located in the Tuzla district is designated as a regional development-oriented university in the maritime field. It is concluded that such a university can contribute in many areas from the dissemination of maritime culture to the training of new stakeholders for the increasingly important maritime trade, from pollution prevention to the development of maritime technologies.

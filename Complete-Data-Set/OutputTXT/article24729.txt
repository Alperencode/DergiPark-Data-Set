Makale Başlığı: Cervical Dystonia Associated with Sertraline in an Adolescent A Case
Özet: In recent years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are widely prescribed in child and adolescent psychiatry practice because they are regarded as having less severe side-effects. Despite reliabilities, acathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor and tardive dyskinesia have been reported as the extrapyramidal system findings associated with use of SSRIs. In this report, we discuss a clinical case of cervical dystonia secondary to sertraline use in an adolescent patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of dystonia associated with sertraline use in an adolescent patient.

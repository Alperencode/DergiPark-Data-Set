Makale Başlığı: Inegol Inscriptions
Özet: The Inegol region, where was an important settlement area during the Roman and Byzantine Empires, also hosted the establishment of the Ottoman Principality. After the Inegol area was conquered by the Turks, new ones were added to the existing buildings, and zoning and construction activities have been accelerated and given priority. However, various reasons such as region is in the earthquake-prone area, the First World War, and the Greek Occupation that followed caused the destruction of many buildings or their complete disappearance. In addition, many buildings, the first construction of which dates back to the foundation years of the Devlet-i Aliyye, have survived hitherto with various repairs and entirely restored.The current study is aimed to identify and introduce the inscriptions on the structure built in the Turkish period in Inegol. An evaluation to be made on the inscriptions, which are the identity documents of the buildings, will serve different purposes such as accurately dating the buildings, determining their functions, and the names of the patronage and master builders. In the study, 15 inscriptions found in the region will be evaluated. When the aforementioned inscriptions are evaluated holistically, it is possible to reach epigraphic information that will contribute to the understanding of the architectural, historical, and artistic features of Inegol.In this publication, the building inscriptions found in the Inegol region will be evaluated from different aspects such as material-technique, font and language, content and ornamental features.

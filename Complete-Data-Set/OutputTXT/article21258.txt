Makale Başlığı: Cystic fibrosis case diagnosed in adulthood with recurrent pancreatitis
Özet: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessively inherited hereditary disease seen in the Caucasian race. As a result of different mutations in the gene "cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulating protein", it can cause various clinical pictures from mild to severe. Nineteen-year-old male patient was admitted to our outpatient clinic with complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and inability to gain weight. The patient's malnutrition, admission to diarrhea, and recurrent pancreatitis attacks made us suspect that he could have cystic fibrosis. In our case, the sweat test was found to be at a high level. Cystic fibrosis gene analysis was found to be positive. The case is presented in order to keep cystic fibrosis in mind in patients with recurrent pancreatitis, to emphasize that the symptoms can start at a later age and that the diagnosis is easy.

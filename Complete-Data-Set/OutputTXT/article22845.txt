Makale Başlığı: The Mediating Role of Perceived Social Capital on the Relations of Perceived Organizational Virtuousness and Socially Responsible Leadership with Employee Well-Being
Özet: Nowadays, employees’ well-being has become an important subject of research since the concept of employee well-being is essential in terms of economic, social, and psychological factors for an organization and/or individuals. The aim of the study is to examine the relationship of employee well-being with perceived organizational virtuousness and socially responsible leadership and to test the mediating role of perceived social capital in these relationships. To rationalize the proposed model, online survey was used to collect the data and 311 employees from various sectors in Istanbul/Turkey were reached. First, descriptive statistics and factor and reliability analyzes were performed, and then correlation and regression analyses were run to test the model. According to the results, perceived organizational virtuousness and socially responsible leadership were positively associated with employee well-being. In addition, it has been revealed that social capital has a mediating role in both relations. The recommendations for leaders and researchers are to give more importance to the concepts at the level of organization and leader to increase employees’ well-being and to carry out practices for creating social capital in organizations.

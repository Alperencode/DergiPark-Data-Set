Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Military Expenditures and Economic Growth: Testing the Validity of The Benoit  Hypothesis
Özet: If defense expenditures are made for domestically produced products, it will have positive effects on economic growth. Similarly, the positive and long-term realization of economic growth will also have a positive effect on defense expenditures. There are many academic studies on this subject. The most important among these is the work carried out by Benoit in 1978. This study, which is included in the literature as the Benoit hypothesis, focuses on the connection between defense expenditures and economic growth. The aim of this study is to test the Benoit hypothesis, which focuses on the relationship between defense expenditures and economic growth, for the Turkish economy. In the study, the relations between defense expenditures and GDP in the period of 1990-2019 were examined, stability tests were conducted and the existence of causality relations between the indicators was tested. As a result of the analysis, the existence of a bilateral interaction between defense expenditures and economic growth has been obtained. It has been concluded that the Benoit Hypothesis is valid in the Turkish economy. In addition, it has been found that there is a mutual causality relationship between defense expenditures and economic growth, which expresses economic performance for Turkey.

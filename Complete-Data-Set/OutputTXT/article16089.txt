Makale Başlığı: Generation of Flood Hazard Maps (Samsun, Mert River)
Özet: Flood is a natural disaster in which the water in the riverbed cannot fit into its bed for various reasons and damages the surrounding settlements, lands, and infrastructure facilities. In the world and in our country, floods are second among all disasters in terms of loss of life and property, and first among meteorological disasters. To reduce the damages of floods that cause loss of life and property, it is necessary to investigate the mechanism that turns the flood into a disaster and to take measures before the flood occurs. The aim of this study is to produce flood hazard maps with two-dimensional hydraulic models in Samsun Mert Basin. Hazard maps were obtained by using the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) method and arranging in ArcGIS, the model results obtained by using the programs in HEC-RAS and FLO-2D for the 50, 100, 500 and 1000-year recurrent flow rates (Q50, Q100, Q500 and Q1000) calculated in the downstream region where the Mert River Basin intersects with the city limits. When the results were examined, it was determined that the region was affected by recurrent floods according to both models. 42%-70% of the flood areas were at a very high danger level and various suggestions were made.

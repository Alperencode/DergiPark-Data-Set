Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Defense Expenditures and Economic Growth: An Analysis on the Countries That Make the Most Defense Expenditures
Özet: The relationship between defense expenditures and economic growth variables has been the subject of many studies. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of defense expenditures on economic growth with military expenditures and economic growth data for the period of 2000-2020 in selected countries (USA, China, India, Russia and the United Kingdom) with the highest defense expenditures. In the study in which the empirical analysis was made, first of all, the unit root states were tested with the LLC and IPS tests, which are the first generation unit root testers. The cointegration relationship between the variables was examined with the Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests and the coefficient estimation was made with FMOLS and DOLS methods, which are long-term coefficient estimators. It was found that there is a cointegration relationship between the variables. According to the FMOLS method result; a 1% increase in defense expenditures increases economic growth by approximately 1.02%. According to the DOLS result; a 1% increase in defense expenditures increases economic growth by approximately 1.08%. It is seen that increases in defense expenditures increase economic growth throughout the panel in which these countries are discussed.

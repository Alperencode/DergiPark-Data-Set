Makale Başlığı: TACROLIMUS ASSOCIATED HEMORRHAGIC POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME: A RARE CASE IN THE LATE PERIOD AFTER RENAL TRANSPLANTATION
Özet: Immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors, which are commonly used in transplant patients may play a role in the development of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), one of the rare neurological complications after organ and tissue transplantation. This complication, which is often seen in the early period after transplantation, occurs in the late period in a small number of cases. In this case report, to draw attention to this dramatic side effect of calcineurin inhibitors, we present a case of hemorrhagic PRES, which developed in the late period after kidney transplantation most likely associated with tacrolimus treatment.

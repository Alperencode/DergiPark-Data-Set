Makale Başlığı: The Political Dimension of Gender Budgeting
Özet: Considering the perception of gender as a socio-economic and political economy discussion area is important in terms of evaluating the different application forms of gender-based budgeting. As a matter of fact, the policy tool that makes gender roles visible in the political decision-making process is the gender-based budgeting approach. The main point to be taken into account in gender-based budget approaches is whether budget policies help to resolve structural problems shaped by gender roles, such as women being confined in the private sphere and  making it invisible women's labor invisible. In this framework, the main purpose is to create budget systems that aim to transform gender roles. From this point of view, in the study, social services -oriented budget policies that legitimize gender roles are evaluated as "sensitive" approaches to gender, while approaches that involve the transformation of gender roles are conceptualized as a gender "based" budget policy approach. Such a conceptualization is discussed within the framework of the relationship between democracy models and gender budgeting practices. From this point of view, the effects of gender-based budget policies on women's social position are evaluated and questioned in each model of democracy.

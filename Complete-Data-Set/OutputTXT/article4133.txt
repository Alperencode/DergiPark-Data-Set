Makale Başlığı: A Critical Approach to the Formation of the Alternative Musical Field in the Context of the Islamic Movement
Özet: In Turkey, besides many artistic activities such as poetry, novels, and cinema, music was one of the critical areas that the Islamic movement's publicity aimed to create in the 1980s. The retreat of religion in many political, social and cultural areas in Turkey's modernization process has revealed a new musical practice and thought built around Islamic discourse and concepts. Music activities in Islamic habitus also reflect a dual structure within a structure that continues the dual narratives of modernization. Understanding and experiencing music brings up the problem of the existence of two opposite fields, which we can call religious and demonic, and music is always seen as a representation of a demonic area on its own. This approach limits the possibilities of interaction between music and religious discourse and prevents the music from producing multiple meanings, causing it to gain a one-dimensional structure. Thus, religious discourse reflects the authority of religious space to the forms of structure and agency at every stage in which music is produced. One of the essential consequences of this situation is the inability of the alternative musical field to reproduce itself in the publicity of the Islamic movement. Another is that the movement loses its dynamic structure, becomes identified with the meaning produced in a certain period of history, and hence loses its power to influence society.

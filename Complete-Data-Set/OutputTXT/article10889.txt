Özet: In general, hair, especially long hair, has been identified with women and seen as an ornamental element in the world. In the old Turkish societies, it is understood from historical sources that women and men had long hair, and it is understood that hair length was seen as equivalent to strength, and hair was given importance in social life in ancient times. It is possible to look for the traces of the expression of hair in ancient Turkish societies in the belief system of Turkish societies. According to Shamanism, one of the oldest Turkish beliefs, hair is alive and carries a spirit. In addition, shamans, who are practitioners of shamanism, also have long hair, and it is believed that long hair gives them strength. In addition to shamanism, the hair depictions of evil spirits are particularly striking in the belief of “iye,” which is based on the belief that there is a spirit in everything, which is one of the oldest Turkish beliefs. Evil spirits that bring trouble and disaster to people are generally depicted as long-haired, and it is believed that they bring trouble and evil to people through people's hair. This study has followed the traces of the beliefs that have developed about hair as a result of various beliefs in Turkish societies within the Kyrgyz folk culture. First of all, the meanings of hair in Kyrgyz folk culture are emphasized and the importance of girls in their life periods is given in terms of shape. Then, the elements related to hair in the Kyrgyz folk culture were examined as material and intangible folk culture elements.

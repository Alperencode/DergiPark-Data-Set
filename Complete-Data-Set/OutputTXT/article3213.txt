Makale Başlığı: Global Water Stress and Measurement Methods
Özet: Consisting of approximately 332.5 million cubic miles of water in the world, 96% of the water resources are salt water resources including the oceans and seas. Of the remaining 4%, 68% of the freshwater resources are trapped in glaciers, while 30% is underground water. In addition to the fact that usable water resources are so few due to natural reasons; Environmental pollution caused by industrialization and urbanization, drought caused by global warming as a result of continuous and significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and human factors such as changes in precipitation regimes and geometrically increasing population lead to a further decrease in the amount of clean water per capita. While water is a natural resource that is increasingly scarce, the poverty experienced especially in underdeveloped countries makes it more difficult for people living in these countries to access water. The data discussed in this study show that the world will face a much more serious water problem, especially in 2030 and beyond. The primary aim of the study is to contribute to the elimination of the lack of literature in our country regarding the 'water poverty index' (WPI), which is one of the important indices measuring water stress in the world. This is very important in terms of raising awareness of the issue in the eyes of policy makers and the society, especially in countries like ours, which are experiencing water stress by conducting the necessary scientific studies. In addition, the aim of this study is to review once again what we can do for the future of water so that the water rationing application, which seems likely to be discussed in the future, is not needed.

Makale Başlığı: The Use of Ketamine in Trauma Patients
Özet: Trauma is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Stress response secondary to injury occurs at these patients. Because of pain respiratory rate can increase at them. In this regards airway management and hemodynamic stability are important parameters in trauma patients. Ketamine has noncompetitive antagonistic properties on the receptor of N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) and it can stimulate brainstem by noradrenalin reuptake inhibition. For that it can be used on monitorization of hemodynamic unstable trauma patients which monitorization is not suitable. We aimed to investigate the frequency of ketamine use in clinical practice in trauma patients and whether it is the preferred agent in traumatic brain injuries and injuries with increased intraocular pressure (IOB) by reviewing the literature.

Makale Başlığı: The Place of Holistic Human Understanding in Renê Guênon's Traditionalist Thought in the Modern World
Özet: Since history, the issues about where people come from and where they are heading have always been a matter of curiosity. At this point, various ideas have been put forward about the nature of human being. In Antiquity, this situation manifested itself as an arche problem. The ultimate goal of man, who tries to find the first cause of existence, is to learn where his own existence comes from. Even in this period, people questioned the reason for their existence and where they came from. Discoveries and inventions, including the era in which humanity has come today, are perhaps the result of this curiosity. Man also wonders where his existence is heading. At this point, various human understandings emerge. In this study, we will try to reveal the place of Renê Guênon's holistic human understanding in the modern world. We will explain Guénon's critique of the modern world through modern human typology.

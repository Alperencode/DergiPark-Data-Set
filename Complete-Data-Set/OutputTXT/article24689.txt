Makale Başlığı: Influence of Different Si Levels on Mechanical Properties of Aluminium Casting Alloys
Özet: AlSi7and AlSi11 are the most commonly used materials in aluminum alloy wheelproduction. The main difference is the heat treatment application; for wheelproduction AlSi7 is usually used in heat treated form while AlSi11 is not. Heattreatment processes play a vital role on production costs. More than fiftypercent of aluminum wheels are heat treated however the exact value variesbetween different manufacturers. Additional heat treatment costs directlyaffect the competitiveness of the manufacturer. In this study the materialproperties of an alternative Si level between AlSi7 and AlSi11 are examined andthe effects of these intermediate Si levels on mechanical properties arecompared with that of AlSi7 and AlSi11. The aim of this study to examine thepossibility of obtaining mechanical properties of heat treated AlSi7 with anon-heat-treated material differing only in Si content. In this experiment allprocesses and casting parameters for different material types are the sameexcept for the Si content. In addition to an experimental study, the mechanicalproperties of the alternative material are simulated by utilizing a materialanalysis software and these properties are compared with experimental results.Thus, correlation between simulation and experimental study results can also beexamined. As a conclusion, the alternative non-heat-treated material ispresented to manufacturers. These results may be used to bypass the heattreatment process and to decrease the cost of final product.

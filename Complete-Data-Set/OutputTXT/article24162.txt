Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATION AND EXAMPLE OF FETH-I BELGRADE MAQAM IN TURKISH MUSIC
Özet: From the past to the 21st century, Turkish music has been enriched by theorists and performers with improvements and developments in the field of maqam, composition, instrumental and spoken words, and transferred from generation to generation through written sources. It is known from the written sources that the composers of the period invented new maqams, composed works in these maqams, and some of these works reached the 21st century, both on the victories of the sultans of the period and on the joy of the people for the conquered lands. It is a well-known fact that the number of works is high in the maqams that are widely used in Turkish music and the number of works is low in the maqams that are less used. It can be said that if the less used maqams are not brought to light, it will be inevitable to forget the theoretical and practical aspects. For this reason, in this study, the analysis of the works in the Feth-i Belgrad maqam, which is one of the less used maqams, and the theoretical structure of the maqam are discussed. Two works in the maqam of Feth-i Belgrad mentioned in the Turkish Art Music Repertoire of the TRT Music Department were examined and the analysis of the maqam direction according to the Arel Theory was carried out. As a result of the analysis, the characteristic elements and features of the maqam were determined and an instrumental artifact was composed in order to exemplify the Feth-i Belgrad maqam.

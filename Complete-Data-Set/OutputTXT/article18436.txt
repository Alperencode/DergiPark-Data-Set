Makale Başlığı: Antibiotic Resistance Patterns in Pediatric Urinary Tract Infections: A Comparison Between 2013-2015 and 2019-2021
Özet: Objective: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections in children. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the etiology and antibiotic susceptibility results of urine cultures obtained between 2013-2015 and 2019-2021 and evaluate local epidemiologic differences over years.Materials and Methods: A total of 1,000 samples with positive urine cultures (500 cultures each for the 2013-2015 and 2019-2021 periods) and antibiogram results were included in this study.Results: The most grown uropathogens were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. in both two periods. E. coli and Klebsiella spp. showed high resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone. The resistance rates of E. coli to ampicillin, amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were reported as 65%, 46%, and 45%, respectively and significantly increased in 2019-2021 compared to 2013-2015 (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.003, respectively). There was no significant difference in the resistance rates of Klebsiella, Proteus and Enterococcus spp. to antibiotics during the two-study period.Conclusion: It was observed that the most commonly used antibiotics, ampicillin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, against E. coli had the highest resistance rates. It is important to confirm the local susceptibility patterns of antibiotics to revise local guidelines in terms of empirical antibiotic recommendations in UTIs.

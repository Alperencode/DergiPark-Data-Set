Makale Başlığı: The Process Leading to the Khojaly Massacre and its Reflections in the Turkish and Foreign Press
Özet: Khojaly, located in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, was attacked by the Armenian armed forces on the night of February 25, 1992, as a result of the Yerevan administration's desire to dominate Nagorno-Karabakh and subsequently implement an imperialist policy such as the establishment of "Great Armenia". During this attack, which was supported by the 366th Motorized Regiment of the former Soviet Army in Khankendi, according to official figures, a total of 613 people were killed, including 106 women, 63 children, and 70 elderly people; 487 people, 76 of them children, were seriously injured and 1,275 people were taken prisoner. 150 people have not been heard from again. According to unofficial figures, the number of massacres is 1,300 and the number of casualties is over 1,000. While Armenia's massacre in Khojaly has taken its place in history as a murder committed against humanity, this atrocity has had repercussions in the national and foreign press.The study aims to contribute to the literature by presenting the reason for the Armenians' attack on Khojaly, the massacre they committed during the attack, and the tragic events that the people of Khojaly went through due to this massacre, and to reveal the reflections of the Khojaly Massacre on the Turkish and Western press. In this study, the mentioned process has been examined in the light of relevant studies, and domestic and foreign periodicals.

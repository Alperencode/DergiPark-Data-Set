Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMERS' POULTRY MEAT CONSUMPTION HABITS AND PERCEPTIONS AND POULTRY BREEDING PROCESSES
Özet: In this study, the evaluation of the factors affecting the consumers’ perception and habits for poultry meat consumption; and the factors affecting the poultry breeding processes were investigated. For these purposes, consumer and breeder surveys were conducted with the attendance of 655 consumers and 323 producers from Turkey. Consumer survey focuses on purchasing habits, consumption preferences, the effects of the news on purchasing habits, and the false-facts about the poultry's washing, thawing, feeding, healing, and growing practices. In the breeder survey, breeders’ opinion on feeding, healing, and growing in production processes, “Salmonella Control Program” and misleading news were analyzed. Findings showed that the frequency of poultry meat consumption varied significantly according to the demographic features. The expiration date was the most important factor that consumers paid attention to when purchasing poultry meat. Both the poultry sector and consumer preferences were affected by the misleading news published in the media. Packaging also played a significant role in purchasing habits.

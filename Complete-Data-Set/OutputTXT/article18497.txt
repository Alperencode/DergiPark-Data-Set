Makale Başlığı: Armenians in Turkish Foreign Policy In The Context of Their Effects On Foreign Policy Decision-Making Process
Özet: Many factors affecting the national foreign policy decision-making process of states. One of these factors is internal socio-political system, too. There exists a multi-ethnic structure in this socio-political order and the impact of the minority ethnic groups on this order are extensive. In particular, the proportion of ethnic groups in total population, whether or not they demand independence, whether they are under the rule of democratic or anti-democratic government and the tools used by these ethnic minority groups are of paramount importance in foreign policy decision-making process of multi-ethnic states. The means used by the ethnic minority groups to affect the decision-making process may also cover non-democratic methods including the activities of ethnic-based terrorist organizations. These organizations are an important factor in observing the impact of the internal socio-political structure on the foreign policy decision-making process. In order to attract the attention of the international system these terrorist organizations are considered quite instrumental. The involvement of international actors significanly influences internal-foreign policy decision making processes. Therefore the existence of ethnic minorities and ethnic-based terrorist organizations can be an effective tool for directing internal and external political orientations. In this context the Armenian issue and ASALA has been one of the actors and factors that have had a significant influence on the history of the decision-making process in the Turkish foreign policy.

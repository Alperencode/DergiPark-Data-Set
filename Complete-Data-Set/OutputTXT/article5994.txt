Makale Başlığı: Design and Analysis of Hydrogen Production Combined System from Hydrogen Sulfide with Renewable Energy Source
Özet: The importance of clean energy resources has increased with the gradually decrease of energy resources and increasing environmental conscious. Hydrogen energy, comes at the forefront of environmentally friendly energy sources, can also be produced from hydrogen sulfide which is abundant in the bottoms of the Black Sea. The Black Sea has a great energy potential with a hydrogen capacity of 270 million tons. In this research, a study has been carried out that the energy required for the production of hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide at the bottom of the Black Sea by direct electrolysis method can be obtained from renewable energy sources on the Black Sea coast. A plant design which can produce 50 tons of hydrogen per year with approximately 640 MWh obtained from solar and wind energy on the Black Sea coasts has been considered. It was concluded that a hybrid system that can benefit from both solar and wind energy could be established in Istanbul and Zonguldak Filyos as a result of the solar and wind energy potential analyzes and economic analyzes were carried out in order to investment evaluation in these locations. Net present value method and internal rate of return method have been preferred and two different scenarios where the investment is realized by receiving 100% loan or by receiving 25% equity capital and 75% loan are discussed. Investment feasibility assessment and profitability ratios for both Istanbul and Filyos seem to be quite good, and it has been observed that the payback period of solar power plants is shorter compared to wind power plants.

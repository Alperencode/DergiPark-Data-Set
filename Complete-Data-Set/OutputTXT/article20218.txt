Makale Başlığı: Relationships of School Principals’ Ethical Leadership and Teachers’ Job Satisfaction on Teachers’ Organizational Commitment
Özet: The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of school principals' ethical leadership behaviors and teachers' job satisfaction over the predictability level of teachers' organizational commitment. The current research is a descriptive study based on the relational model. The research population consists of 1220 teachers working at secondary public schools (Anatolin high school, science high school, vocational high school) located in Eskişehir downtown (Odunpazarı and Tepebasi districts).  	  	Seeing that the research population was accessible, no spesific sample method was used for data selection. After removing out the missing questionnaires, 940 teachers were included in this study. The research concluded that ethical leadership and teachers' job satisfaction are predictor variables which have the biggest effect on teachers' organizational commitment. Additionally, it was found that gender and school type variables predict teachers' organizational commitment to a small extent.  	  	That is, when job satisfaction perception of male teachers working at Anatolian high school and ethical leadership increase, their organizational commitment perception is predictable associated with the increase concerned. Besides, the results evidenced that ethical leadership behaviors of school administrators is the main predictor to explain teachers' job satisfaction while job satisfaction functions as a mediating variable of the relationship between ethical leadership and organizational commitment variables.

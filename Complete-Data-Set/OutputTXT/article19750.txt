Makale Başlığı: Cities of the Plain: The End of the All-American Cowboys
Özet: This article analyzes Cormac McCarthy’s Cities of the Plain(1998), the last installment of The Border Trilogy, and scrutinizes hisportraits of cowboy masculinity. Not only does the article considerthe way McCarthy deals with wounded masculinity and the adultWestern genre in the novel, but it also discusses how the protagonists,John Grady and Billy, end their illusions concerning their cowboymasculinity, as each comes to terms with the fact that the cowboylifestyle is based on a myth, and that there are no more frontiers in theworld for would-be cowboys to ride. McCarthy’s cowboy protagonistsmust negotiate a West that is no longer the province of the cowboyin the millennium, but rather the site of twentieth-century militaryinstallations, large corporate ranches, and frightening modern-daybureaucracies. The key to survival in this vexed post-West world turnsout to be not adherence to the old regional myths and conventions—no matter how attractive that might seem—but instead, a turn towardshealthier masculinities. While the cowboys’ epic journeys may evokea noble and masculine western tradition, as McCarthy illustrates, theyare doomed to fail because of the upheaval and displacement of thecommunity and culture in which such masculinities thrived.

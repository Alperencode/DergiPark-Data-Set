Makale Başlığı: Differences between provenances in terms of some morphological characteristics in the scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) provenance trial of the Lakes region
Özet: This study was carried out to evaluate some morphological features of a Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) provenance trial, which was established twenty years ago with thirty provenances in Isparta-Aydoğmuş and Burdur-Kemer, located in the Mediterranean climate zone. Within the scope of the research, measurements and observations were made on some morphological characteristics (tree diameter, branch thickness, number of branches, branch angle) in the most successful ten provenances, according to the results of scientific studies carried out from the day the experiment was established until today. When a common evaluation is made in terms of all studied characters, Çatacık, Mesudiye, Şenkaya, Sarıkamış, and Gölköy provenances can be recommended as an alternative seed source for the trial areas and their surroundings.

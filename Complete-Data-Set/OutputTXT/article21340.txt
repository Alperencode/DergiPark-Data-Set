Makale Başlığı: Identification of serum predictors of n-acetyl-l-cysteine and isoproterenol induced remodelling in cardiac hypertrophy
Özet: Cardiac hypertrophy (CH), leading to cardiac failure is due to chronic metabolic alterations occurring during cellular stress. Besides  the  already  known  relationship  between  oxidative  stress  and  CH,  there  are  implications  of  reductive  stress  leading  to  CH.  This study attempted to develop reductive stress-based CH rat model using n-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione agonist that was compared  with  typical  isoproterenol  (ISO)  induced  CH  model.  The  main  objective  was  to  identify  serum  metabolites  that  can  serve  as potent predictors for seven routine clinical and diagnostic parameters in CH: 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), lactic acid (LA), urea, and ECG-CH parameters (QRS complex, R-amplitude, R-R interval, heart rate) that were hypothesized to underlie metabolic remodelling in this study. CH was assessed using electrocardiography, hypertrophic index and histopathological analysis (H&E stain) in both ventricles after  2  weeks.  Gas  chromatography  mass  spectroscopy  analysis  (GC-MS)  identified  unique  metabolite  finger-prints.  Correlation  and  pattern analysis revealed strong relationships between specific metabolites and parameters (Pearson’s score > 0.7) of this study. Multiple regression analysis (MRA) for the strongly related metabolites (independent variables) with each of the seven parameters (dependent variables)  identified  significant  predictors  for  the  latter  namely  fructose,  valine,  butanoic  acid  in  NAC  and  cholesterol,  erythrose,  isoleucine  in  ISO  models,  with  proline  and  succinic  acid  as  common  for  both  models.  Metabolite  set  enrichment  analysis  (MSEA)  of  those  significant  predictors  (p  <  0.05)  mapped  butyrate  metabolism  as  highly  influential  pathway  in  NAC,  with  arginine-proline  metabolism and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation as common pathways in both models, thus providing new insights towards initial metabolic remodeling in the pathogenesis of CH.

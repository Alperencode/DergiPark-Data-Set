Makale Başlığı: Eski Uygurca Sosyo-Ekonomik Belgeler Hakkındaki Çalışmaların Kaynakçası
Özet: Many research has been published on the documents called Old Uyghur Civil Documents. Wilhelm Radloff was the first scholar to edit these documents and it has been 125 years since his first book called Uigurische Sprachdenkmäler: Materialen. Therefore it has been necessary to prepare the bibliography of these studies. This bibliography is chronological and includes books, journal articles, conference presentations, chapters in edited volumes, etc. The bibliography also focuses on the naming and classification of Old Uyghur Socio-Economic Documents.

Makale Başlığı: Physico-Chemical Characterization of Local Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) Cultivars Grown in Dicle District of Diyarbakır Province
Özet: In this study, physico-chemical properties of fruits belonging to standard pomegranate cultivars (Hicaznar) and local pomegranate cultivars (Ağa narı, Mayhoş, Tatlı nar, Hınara tırş, Miğoş, Hınara şirin, K. Mayhoş, Bori and Şekerek) were determined. In the research, fruit weight of the evaluated varieties is 104.11-501.67 g, fruit length is 53.24-88.98 mm, fruit diameter is 59.36-101.49 mm, shape index is 0.86-0.97, fruit volume is 93.33-485.00 cm3, fruit juice amount is 34.90-90.90 ml, fruit density. 0.88-1.12 g/cm3, seed weight 70.09-336.17 g and 100 seed weight changed between 19.77-35.07 g. The total amount of soluble dry matter (SSCM) varied between 13.73-15.93%, pH 3.23-4.68 and total acidity between 0.21-1.20%. In addition, the color of the skin of the bottom of the skin, the color of the top of the skin, the thickness of the skin, the hardness of the fruit, the number of upper and lower chambers and cracking conditions in the shell were determined.

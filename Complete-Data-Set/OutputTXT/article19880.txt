Makale Başlığı: The effect of composite placement technique on the internal adaptation, gap formation and microshear bond strength
Özet: Purpose: This study aimed to compare the efficiency of placement technique on internal adaptation, gap formation and microshear bond strength (µSBS) of bulk-fill composite resin materials. Materials and methods: Standardized class V cavities were prepared for microcomputed tomography (mCT) test and divided into four groups (n=12) as follows: Group SDR: Smart Dentin Replacement system/bulk fill; Group SF2: Sonic-Fill system/bulk fill sonic-activated composite placement system; Group CHU: Herculite-XRV-Ultra composite resin inserted with Compothixo/sonic-vibrated composite resin placement system; Group HIT: Herculite-XRVUltra composite resin applied with incremental technique. Self-etch adhesive (Optibond-XTR) was used for bonding in all groups. After 10000 thermocycling, mCT scans were taken to reveal gap formation at the tooth-restoration interface and universal testing machine was used to test microshear bond strength (µSBS) values (n=10). ANOVA, post-hoc Bonferroni and Tukey HSD tests were used for evaluating the gap formation and µSBS values (p=0.05). Results: SF2 and CHU showed the best adaptability compared with both SDR and HIT. The difference between groups SDR and HIT was statistically significant (p<0.05). µSBS values were found to be the highest for SF2, and the lowest for HIT groups (p>0.05). Conclusions: Bulk-fill composite resins placed either with sonic-activated or sonic-vibrated instrument demonstrated better adaptability, less gap formation and higher bond strength than both the bulk-fill flowable composite and conventional incremental techniques.

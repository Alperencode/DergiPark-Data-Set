Makale Başlığı: BATI BALKANLAR'DA SOSYAL İKLIM (2018-2021)
Özet: This work analyzes the results of the World Social Capital Monitor, which is a worldwide open access Social Capital Survey for citizens to better understand the social climate in their countries, for the Western Balkans; namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia between 2018 and 2021. The World Social Capital Monitor was developed by the Basel Institute of Commons and Economics (http://commons.ch/) for the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development partnership. Within the UN framework, it is being used for promoting Sustainable Development Goals. It has been selected for the SDGs: 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions). While all 17 SDGs depend on social goods, assessing and enhancing social goods is one of the few approaches to addressing all the 17 SDGs in one. The World Social Capital Monitor consists of open access online survey (http://commons.ch/assessing-social-capital/) assessing the social capital of countries around the globe (currently conducted in 50 languages in 300 cities by 2021). Timelines and comments, for eight social goods (climate, trust, measures, taxes, local investment, helpfulness, friendliness, hospitality) provided by the survey, have been published annually since 2017 for each country affiliated with the World Social Capital Monitor. This work, comparing and contrasting the results of the survey among the Western Balkan Countries between 2018 and 2021, will provide a better understanding of the social climate in the region, involving the impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which is considered the greatest health crisis in the past one hundred years.

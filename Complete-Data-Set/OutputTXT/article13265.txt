Makale Başlığı: Zamakhshari's Approach to Verses Related to the Unseen (In the Context of al-Kashshâf)
Özet: In this study, Zamakhshari’s approach to the verses about the unseen (ghayb) will be discussed and examined. The unseen is a field of knowledge that cannot be grasped by the senses and the mind. However, the unknowns about the unseen are for man, not for Allah. Because Allah has encompassed everything, secret and open, with His knowledge. Zamakhshari interprets the verses about the unseen in his own way and emphasizes that the unseen can only be known by Allah. He states that if angels or prophets are to be given information about the unseen, it will only be through revelation. He states that the unseen can be interpreted or reported on by some people without the knowledge of revelation, but this will not go beyond conjecture and guesswork. Again, he is of the opinion that mugayyebât-ı hamse should be considered within the scope of the absolute unseen. In our study, after mentioning the definition of the unseen in the context of Zamakhshari’s commentary, it will be discussed whether the unseen can be known or not, and then the subject of mugayyebat-ı hamsa will be examined.

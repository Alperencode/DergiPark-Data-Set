Makale Başlığı: Determination of Quality Parameters and Sensory Attributes of ‘Jaffa’ Oranges Irradiated as Postharvest Quarantine Treatment Throughout Long-Term Cold Storage
Özet: The Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) is one of the major problems in the citrus producing and trading countries including Turkey. Commercial application of radiation processing can be the alternative and effective solution to overcome this problem. The objective of the present study was the determination the sensory attributes, quality parameters and also cold storage shelf-life of ‘Jaffa’ oranges (Citrus sinensis (L) Osbeck) irradiated (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 kGy) as considering postharvest quarantine treatment for the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata). The quality parameters of the control and irradiated oranges were determined in terms of weight loss, pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, reducing sugars, vitamin C content, total carotenoids, pectin, color of fruit during cold storage at 4 ± 0.1 oC and 85 - 90 % relative humidity (RH) on the 0, 15, 30 and 45 d of storage. Obtained results showed that, low dose irradiation is applicable regarding as other significant quality parameters of ‘Jaffa’ oranges such as vitamin C, total carotenoids, invert sugars, pectin, weight loss, pH, acidity and total soluble solids did not affect consumption and commercial value of ‘Jaffa’ sweet oranges up to 45 d of storage at 4 oC. According to overall sensory attributes, irradiated fruit were still acceptable as judged by panelists and ≤1.0 kGy irradiation dose more suitable for keeping important attributes of processed ‘Jaffa’ orange fruit.

Makale Başlığı: News Media Literacy Scale: Validity and Reliability
Özet: The concept of news media literacy is aimed at understanding how and why  individuals  interact  with  the  news  media,  how  individuals  make  sense  of  what  they  consume,  and  how  individuals  are  affected  by  their news consumption. News media literacy represents a skeptical tendency, promoting a critical attitude toward the production and distribution of news content. The study group of the research comprised 499 participants. Exploratory  factor  analysis  indicated  that  the  factor  loads  of  items  in  the  scale  vary  between  0.54  and  0.82,  the scale consists of two sub-dimensions, 9 items in total—the total variance explained by the dimensions is 40%. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the fit indices (Chi-square/df: 4.70; RMSEA: 0.084; SRMR: 0.064; TLI: 0.87; CFI: 0.91; GFI: 0.95; AGFI: 0.91) were found within acceptable limits. The Cronbach’s Alpha and McDonald’s Omega values for the sub-dimensions and the whole of the scale vary between 0.83 and 0.86. Simultaneously, it was concluded that content validity and convergence validity were provided within the scope of the research. As a result, the analyses conducted within the scope of the research show that the News Media Literacy Scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool.

Özet: Television is an important communication tool for advertising to reach the masses. In parallel with technological developments, a variety of methods and techniques have been used in television advertising. One of these methods is the artificial intelligence-based "Deepfake" application, which emerged in 2017. Deepfake is based on matching the face of a real person with that of another person. Although this method was initially used to spread fake videos of celebrities, it was later used for entertainment purposes on social media. This previously uncommon application is now used in various fields, from smartphones to various television shows. One of these areas is advertising. This study aims to show the effect of deepfake application on visual narrative in television advertisements. In this regard, Ziraat Bank's advertisement titled #senhepgülümse, played by Kemal Sunal, was analyzed semiotically. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed in the example of the selected commercial that the use of artificial intelligence in the advertisement contributed positively to the visual narrative.

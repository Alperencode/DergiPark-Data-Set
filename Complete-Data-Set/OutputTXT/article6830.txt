Makale Başlığı: The First “Babi Bunty” Riot in South Caucasia
Özet: In the early 20th century Russian Empire a number women-led riots called “Babi Bunty” manifested. The underlying reason of such actions was actually the economic outcome of the WWI. Famine and scarcity at the end of the war led women whose spouses were fighting to a number of spontaneous protests. The protests that in a short time reached even  the furthest margins of the Empire, demonstrated their impact over South Caucasia, a significant part of the Empire. Baku, a substantial industrial city of the Empire became the epicenter of protests by February 1914. This study discusses the short history of these women-led riots and then it comprehensively analyzes the February protests in Baku by referring to contemporary memorandums and media coverage. The paper focuses on the aims of the rioting women and the reaction of local administrators to the protests. Moreover, such actions in the Russian Empire could be evaluated as a logical continuation of women’s movements manifesting in the modern world.Keywords: Woman, press, Baku, Russian Empire, riot, Babi Bunty.

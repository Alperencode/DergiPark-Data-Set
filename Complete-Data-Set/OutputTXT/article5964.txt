Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Body Fat Percentage with Vertical Jump and Sprint Performances of Football Players
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between body fat percentage with vertical jump and sprint performances of football players. A total of 22 football players (age: 25.45±4.25 years, height: 176.45±6.03 cm, weight: 74.62±6.05 kg) were participated in the study voluntarily. Participants of the study was sampled through simple random sampling method. Anthropometric (height, body weight, body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage) and performance (10-30 meters sprint and vertical jump) parameters were measured from the football players. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was calculated to determine the relationships between the variables. There was a weak positive correlation between 10 meters sprint and body fat percentage (r=0.474, p<0.05); Moderate positive correlation between 30 meters sprint and body fat percentage (r=0.587, p<0.01). Additionally, a weak negative correlation was found between jumping performance and body fat percentage (r=-0.458, p<0.05). İn conclusion, having a high percentage of body fat negatively affects the sprinting abilities of football players. It was observed that the jump performance of the athletes decreased with the increase in body fat percentage, or the jump performance of the athletes increased with the decrease in the fat percentage.

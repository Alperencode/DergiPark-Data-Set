Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF PARENTING STRESS ON THE LIFE OF CHILDREN AGED 2-4 DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Özet: Introduction:This study aims to determine the relationship between the perceived stress levels of parents having children aged 2-4 years with the quality of life of their children, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological behaviors observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method:In the cross-sectional study, 458 parents were enrolled using nonprobability sampling. As data collection tools; descriptive data recording form, perceived stress scale (PSS), and the Quality of Life Scale for Children (QoL-C) were used. QoL-C consists of subdimensions, physical health total score (PHTS), psychosocial health total score (PsychoTS) and the Quality of Life Scale for Children total score (QoL-CTS). Data were collected by online survey via Google Form. Results: The mean age of the parents was 31.73±5.15 years, 86.5% of the parents participating in the study were mothers, a total of 64.2% had higher education. 37.6% of the children were 4 years old and 53.9% were girls. PsychoTS and QoL-CTS were found to be significantly higher in children whose fathers had a high school education or less. In addition, the mean PHTS in children of working parents was significantly higher(p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, variables that were significant in predicting the perceived stress score were having anxiety about contagion to the family(β: -0,258, p<0,001), irritability(β: 0,124, p<0,01), parent being a mother(β: -0,094, p=0,032), and controlling their reaction to the news on social media or TV when their children were with them (β: -0,100, p=0,021). In addition, significant variables in predicting PHTS were having anxiety dream/nightmare (β: -0,099, p=0,037), and controlling their reaction to the news on social media or TV when their children were around (β: 0,121, p=0,009). Variables that were significant in predicting PsychoTS were father's education (β: -0,142, p=0,001), irritability(β: -0,093, p=0,046), sleep disorder (β: -0,119, p=0,01), anxiety dream/nightmare (β: -0,131, p=0,003), jealousy (β: -0, 110, p=0,026), anti social behavior (β: -0,162, p<0,001), and frequent hand washing (β: -0, 146, p=0,001). Variables that were significant in predicting the QoL-CTS score were father's education (β: -0,133, p=0,002), change in eating habits (β: -0,104, p=0,030), dream/nightmare(β: -0,121, p=0,007), jealousy (β: -0, 117, p=0,019), anti social behavior (β: -0,122, p=0,008), frequent hand washing (β: -0, 139, p=0,002), and controlling their reaction to the news on social media or TV when their children were around(β: 2,116, p=0,035). Conclusions: The stress experienced by parents during the pandemic affects the quality of life of children.

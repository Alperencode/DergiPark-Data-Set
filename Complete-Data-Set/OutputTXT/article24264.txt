Makale Başlığı: A Rare Postoperative Total Knee Arthroplasty Complication: type l complex regional pain syndrome of the foot and ankle
Özet: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling disorder that usually affects the extremities. The disease has two forms; symptoms occur without previous peripheral nerve injury in type 1 and with previous injury to specific nerve in type 2. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a treatment choice in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis. TKA surgery has many complications in the postoperative short and long term. Although surgeons are familiar with and can overcome these complications, rare conditions exist that are related to surgery in postoperative period. It's possible to observe TKA-related CRPS type 1 in the knee. Also, CRPS type 1 of foot after successful total hip arthroplasty previously reported. We report a unique case of CRPS type 1 of the left foot and ankle following successful left TKA. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0200This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

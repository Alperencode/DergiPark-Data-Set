Makale Başlığı: Reading Kinetic Architecture Applications on Housing Spaces
Özet: In this study, houses, where kinetic architecture is applied, were investigated to evaluate energy production and environmental factors. As a result of the researches, it is thought that the use of kinetic architecture in residences will increase with the increase in technological developments, environmental factors will be used effectively in architecture and customizable spaces will be a design approach that will attract the attention of users and architects. How kinetic architecture is applied in houses designed for the evaluation of environmental factors and energy production has been researched through architectural projects. Movement purposes, movement principles, movement directions, and the effects of movement in spaces were examined. With the data obtained, how kinetic architecture is reflected in the spaces in the houses has been analyzed. Within the scope of the study, Domespace, Heliotrope, Dragspelhuset, Sharifi-Ha, and Girasole Houses were examined. DomeSpace, Heliotrope, Girasole House are structures that maseffesively rotate relative to the sun and generate energy. It has been determined that kinetic applications cause disruptions in these structures, indoor use, and continuity. In the applications in Dragspelhuset and Sharifi-Ha, it has been seen that the spaces in the buildings move separately from the whole of the building, this movement adapts to the environmental conditions and the spaces can be personalized.

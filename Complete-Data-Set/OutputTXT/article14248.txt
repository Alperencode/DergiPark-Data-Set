Makale Başlığı: ALPARSLAN TÜRKEŞ: "PORTRAIT OF A LEADER AND DEMOCRATIC NATIONALISM AS A THEORY"
Özet: Alparslan Türkeş is one of the most difficult leaders in Turkish political and social life to tell. This stems from Türkeş's versatility and originality. Türkeş has packed many sociological events into his life adventure that started in Nicosia in 1917. He was a soldier in the 1930s; He is a prisoner tried for Turkism in 1944, a member of the National Unity Committee (MBK) of 1960, Counsellor to the Prime Minister and party leader of 1965, a social movement leader and minister of the 1970s, a leader on death row in the 1980s, a top mind and democrat of the 1990s. For this reason, it is possible to imagine Türkeş as one of the important figures who served as a key figure in Turkish political life. Türkeş has built a development model suitable for the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people with various titles as a leader and theoretician.

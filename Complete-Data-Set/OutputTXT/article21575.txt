Özet: This study has been conducted to determine some biological parameters of the Phenacoccus madeirensis Green (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) on four vegetable plants (7 different varieties); tomato (Hazera and Torry) (Solanum lycopersicum L.), eggplant (Adana Topağı  and  Anamur)  (Solanum  melongena  L.),  pepper  (Safran  and  Zafer)  (Capsicum  annuum  L.),  and  Pepino  (Minski)  (Solanum muricatum  L.).  Experiments  were  carried  out  in  climate  cabinets  at  25  ±  2  °C,  60  ±  10%  R.H.,  and  16L:  8D)  in  Plant  Protection  Department Nedim UYGUN Biological Control Laboratory of Agriculture Faculty, Çukurova University between 2017 and 2018. Life table data were analyzed by using an age-stage two-sex life table computer program. According to results of this study, P. madeirensiscompleted its life cycle on eggplant, tomato, pepper and pepino. However, eggplant has been determined as the most suitable host plant for P. madeirensis during this study and the highest values of life table parameters were obtained from eggplant (R0 = 99.14 nymphs/female,  r  =  0.147  d  –  1  ,  λ  =  1.159  d  –  1,  GRR  =  289.49  nymphs/female).  Consequently,  this  invasive  pest  could  potentially  cause  economic losses in vegetable crops

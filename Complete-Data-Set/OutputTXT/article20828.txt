Makale Başlığı: Private Public Partnership Practices in the Health System of European Union Countries
Özet: The changes in the political and economic policies implemented by the states have differentiated the business models of the states. In this context, one of the models discussed today is the public private partnership. The public-private partnership model emphasizes long-term contracts based on the transfer of specific project risks to the private partner regarding the design, construction, operation and financing of primarily service-focused projects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the sectoral distribution of the public private partnership practices of the European Union countries and the practices in the health systems and to discuss the importance of the role of this model in the health sector. The method of the study is systematic analysis. In this direction, the data of the projects financed by the European Public-Private Partnership Expertise Center (European PPP Expertise Center - EPEC) of the European Investment Bank between 1959 and 2020 of the main European Union countries were examined. As a result of the study, it has been seen that public-private partnership practices in health services are gaining more and more importance with the influence of factors such as the political structure of these countries, adaptation to the era, economic reasons, globalization.

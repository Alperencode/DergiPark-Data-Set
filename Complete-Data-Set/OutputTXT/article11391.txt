Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Sense of Honor and Tendency to Violence in Premarital Couples: A Comparative Study in Terms of Gender
Özet: Aim: This research was conducted to compare the relationship between the sense of honor towards women and the tendency to violence in premarital couples in terms of genders. Material and Method: The sample of this cross-sectional and comparative study consisted of 215 (Female=119, Male=96) people who applied to a public health center in eastern Turkey for their wedding ceremony. Data; The Personal Information Form was collected with the “Honor Concept Perception Toward Women Scale” (KINATO) and the “The Violence Tendency Scale” (VTS). In statistical evaluation; mean, standard deviation, percentile distribution, Cronbach’s alpha and pearson correlation analysis were used.Results: It was determined that the total mean score of KINATO was 54.15±15.89 in premarital women and 62.31±13.85 in men, and both genders had an undecided and traditional attitude in terms of honor. It was determined that the total point average and all sub-dimensions of KINATO and the VTS of the men in the premarital period were significantly higher than those of the women (p<0.05). In addition, it was determined that there was a negative and weakly significant relationship between the total point average of the KINATO and VTS of women and men in the premarital period, and the level of violence tendency decreased as the level of having an egalitarian attitude towards women in terms of sense of honor increased.Conclusion: It has been determined that there is a higher tendency to violence in men in the premarital period and that the tendency to violence decreases as the level of egalitarian attitude towards women increases in both genders.

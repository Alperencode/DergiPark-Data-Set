Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Relationship Between Bitcoin Electricity Consumption and the Global Economic and Political Uncertainty Index (GEPU)
Özet: It is possible to define uncertainty as the variability of conditions, the ambiguity and obscurity of statements and events. Uncertainty, for whatever reason, affects the economy in different ways. Uncertainty causes people to be more concerned about their future income. Various estimation and methods have been developed in recent years to calculate the uncertainty, which is equivalent to the concept of uncertainty. These indices, in which economic and political uncertainties are calculated, appear as a form of calculation that also includes political discourses along with financial risk. The aim of this study is to examine the causality relationship between the Global economic political uncertainty index and Bitcoin electricity consumption. For this purpose, the Toda-Yamamoto causality test was applied using data from the period 2011:M7-2022:M1. According to the obtained Toda-Yamamoto causality test findings, Granger causality relationship has been determined both from the global economic-political uncertainty index to Bitcoin electricity consumption and from Bitcoin electricity consumption to the global economic-political uncertainty index.

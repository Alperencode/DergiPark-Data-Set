Makale Başlığı: The Influence of Socio-Cultural Change on the Religion Interpretation: An Evalution within the Context of Grave Visiting
Özet: Religion is an important phenomenon that directs human life and adds meaning to it. From this point of view, religion, as a sociological phenomenon, shapes the social structure and provides institutionalization. When it comes to religion, its effect on the individual and society is emphasized, but the effect of society on religion is mostly ignored. Individuals and societies, which are the primary addressees of religion, have their own characteristics and ways of understanding, and these characteristics can change and transform in the historical process. At this point, it is an important question whether the structural characteristics of societies and the law of change affect the interpretation of religion. Does the phenomenon we call the understanding of religion consist of the religious texts themselves? Is it possible for religions to remain as they emerged forever? Can religious interpretations also change depending on the changing conditions in the historical process? Are there historical dimensions of fiqh or theological provisions? In this study, the effect of social change on religious interpretation is tried to be discussed in the context of grave visits. The historical and sociological background of the visits to the graves, which have become an important topic of discussion, especially in Hanbali-Salafi circles, and the provisions regarding the actions taken during this period are examined. In this context, the effect of social structure on religion or religious interpretation is tried to be examined rather than the effect of religion on society.

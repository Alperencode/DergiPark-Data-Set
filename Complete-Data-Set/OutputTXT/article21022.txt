Makale Başlığı: An Analysis Of  Consumer Motivations For Electronic Word-Of-Mouth (eWOM) On Social Networks
Özet: Since the beginning of the 2000s, parallel to the development of internet technologies, traditional media monologues have turned into mutual dialogues, that is, eWOM on social media platforms and is among the most well-known and common consumer dialogues today. The rate of reading online consumer reviews before making a purchase decision is increasing day by day, whether it is about to decide what to watch on Netflix, which psychologist to go or where to go for vacation; referring to the comments, suggestions and complaints of other consumers is one of the most important stages of consumer decision process today.Twitter, the leading microblogging platform where eWOM spreads most, corresponds to the linguistic marketplace phenomenon defined by Pierre Bourdieu (Bourdieu, 1977) in terms of power relations between message receivers and transmitters, and its unique content production and legitimation mechanisms. A marketplace where both individuals and brands are in a constant struggle for visibility. Apart from the goal of visibility, there are also different rational and emotional motivations defined in the literature on the basis of sharing eWOM content. Within the scope of this research, based on these motivations, the consumer tweets on 2-3-4 February 2021, using the Trendyol Hashtag were analyzed with content analysis method. In line with our analysis, it is concluded that there are eWOM motivations that can be described as common in consumer tweets, and that these motivations can be defined based on common expressions and keywords.

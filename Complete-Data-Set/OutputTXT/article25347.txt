Makale Başlığı: PROSPECTIVE MATHEMATICS TEACHERS’ MOST USED LEARNING STRATEGY: PEER COLLABORATION
Özet: The aim of the research is to determine the level of awareness of prospective mathematics teachers’ perceptions levels of learning strategies. It is important that the learning strategies, which have an important role in accomplishing the specified instructional tasks and performing effective learning, should be used effectively by the prospective teachers. The survey model was used to determine the current learning strategies of the prospective teachers. The study group is composed of 60 prospective teachers who are studying in the final year of elementary school mathematics teacher education. The Learning Strategies Scale was used as a data collection tool. The scale consists of four sub-scale (1) Cognitive (repetition and organizing) and Meta-cognitive Strategies, (2) Attribution and Critical Thinking Strategies, (3) Environment and Labor Management Strategies and (4) Help and Peer Collaboration Strategies. When the data on the learning strategies used by the prospective mathematics teachers are examined, it is seen that the general average of the strategies is very high and they use the learning strategies effectively. While the subscale with the highest average has been Taking Hepl and Peer Collaboration Strategies, the lowest average was belong to Environment and Labor Management Strategies. As a result, it has been revealed that prospective mathematics teachers can discuss each other with their classmates to understand the learning content and ask for help from each other at the points they cannot understand.

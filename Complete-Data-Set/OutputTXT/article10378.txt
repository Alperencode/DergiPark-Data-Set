Özet: Every memory is like a building block used in the construction of the magnificent building called history. Taken on their own, they may not mean anything. However, when the whole building is considered, everyone agrees on how important these building blocks are. Because history is made of them. Omer Ozcan published the memories of Bediuzzaman Said Nursi's students about their masters, as an eight-volume book series under the title “Ağabeyler Anlatıyor”. These memories are an important source not only for Bediuzzaman's life, but also for recent history. It is a work that reveals the clues of many truths in terms of religion-politics relations, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, when the state's intervention in religion and religious institutions was very intense. These memories also reveal the context of Risale-i Nur. It is known that the context of a work is as important as its words in understanding a work.

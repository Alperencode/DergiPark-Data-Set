Makale Başlığı: Using Virtual Reality in Primary Education: A Systematic Review
Özet: The concept of virtual reality is defined as a set of technologies that support the creation of highly interactive three-dimensional spatial environments that represent real or unreal situations. Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have become a powerful and promising tool in education due to their unique technological features that make them different from other Information Communication Technologies (ICT) applications. For this reason, it is important to use VR in educational institutions and to investigate its effect on learning. In this direction, the aim of the research is to make a systematic compilation of research on virtual reality applications in education. 38 articles selected according to certain criteria were included. Content analysis was used in the research. According to the research findings, it was determined that quantitative methods were mostly used in the articles, most research was conducted at the 5th and 6th-grade levels, and virtual reality was mostly used in science teaching. In addition, the results showed that learning environments that include virtual and augmented reality elements can improve learners' spatial thinking and problem-solving skills. At the end of the research, it was suggested that mixed methods should be preferred, and different databases should be used for future studies on virtual reality.

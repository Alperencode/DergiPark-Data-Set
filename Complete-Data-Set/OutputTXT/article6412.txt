Makale Başlığı: KOSOVO-EU RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP PROCESS
Özet: The Republic of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, while it was an autonomous region affiliated to Serbia during the Socialist Federal Yugoslavia period, aims to become a member of the European Union, like other Western Balkan countries. In the post-Cold War period, the EU, which included the former Eastern Bloc countries as members, then turned to the Western Balkans and made partnership agreements with the countries of the region, which envisaged future membership. The EU, which put into effect the Copenhagen criteria during the membership process of the Eastern Bloc countries, has put into effect the Stabilization and Association Process for the Western Balkan countries in addition to the Copenhagen criteria. Although the EU has signed Stabilization and Association agreements with Kosovo, as with all Balkan countries, Kosovo's membership process proceeds differently from other Western Balkan countries for many reasons. In this context, the aim of the study is to examine the Kosovo-European Union (EU) relations in the context of the Republic of Kosovo's membership to the European Union (EU). This article examines Kosovo-EU relations as well as examining the EU's policy towards the Western Balkans. In addition to the evaluation and examination of all relevant policies and mechanisms designed to promote EU enlargement, a description of the key moments of this process will be given. The article will also evaluate the challenges in Kosovo's EU accession process.

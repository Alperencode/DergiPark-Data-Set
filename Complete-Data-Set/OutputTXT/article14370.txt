Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Some Leaf Traits in Laurocerasus officinalis M. Roem Taxa Along Elevation and Precipitation Gradient
Özet: In this study, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass area (LMA) values of the leaf samples of Laurocerasus officinalis M. Roem taxon collected in the young, mature and senescence period in a two-year period from the sample plots determined depending on the altitude (0 m, 450 m, 750 m) and precipitation gradient (Ordu, Trabzon, Rize) in the province and east of Ordu were examined. As a result of the three-way analysis of variance for SLA and LMA, depending on the altitude gradient, the year-season bilateral interaction and region factor were found to be statistically significant. According to the Tukey test for SLA, the difference between 0 m and 750 m localities was found to be statistically significant. Statistically significant differences were found between young and mature periods in 2019, and among all three seasons in 2020. According to the Tukey test of the LMA, the 0 locality was determined to be statistically significant. It has been found that the statistically significant difference between the young season in 2019 and among all three seasons in 2020. According to the results of three-way analysis of variance for SLA and LMA, depending on the precipitation gradient, year-season bilateral interaction was found to be statistically significant. However, according to the Tukey test results of SLA and LMA, the young season in 2019, all seasons in 2020 was determined to be statistically significant.

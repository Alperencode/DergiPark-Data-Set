Makale Başlığı: Determination of the Physicochemical Properties and Fatty Acid Composition of Some Cheese Types with Geographical Indication in Thrace Region
Özet: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the differences in the quality characteristics of the famous cheese types produced in Thrace region and labeled with a geographical indication or not. The different physicochemical properties, mineral content, and fatty acid composition of Ezine Cheese and Edirne Feta Cheese, and Malkara Aged Kaşar Cheese with geographical indication were determined. The obtained data were compared with some of the physicochemical specifications stated in the geographical indication registration documents and also with the cheese types of the same category but without the geographical indication. For this purpose, 90 cheese samples from 23 different local producers in Edirne, Tekirdağ, Çanakkale, and Kırklareli were supplied in sealed packages. Dry matter (%), ash (%), salt (%), protein (%), titratable acidity (% lactic acid), acid count (mg KOH/g fat), color (L, a, b) values were determined. Additionally, fatty acid compositions and some mineral contents of the cheese were analyzed by using gas-chromatography and inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). This study aims to contribute to registration documents of geographical indication, which cover the characteristic specifications, including fatty acid composition, protein amount, acid count (free fat acidity), and color (L*, a*, b*) values. It is advised to revise the registration documents of the mentioned cheese types by including aroma-active components to the aroma characterization and texture specifications to the characteristic features through a broader study.

Makale Başlığı: The Environmental Quality-Economic Complexity Relationship:  A Fourier Cointegration Analysis of the Turkish Economy
Özet: his  study  investigates  the  relationship  between  environmental  quality  and  economic  complexity  using  the  variables  of  annual  economic   growth,   economic   complexity   index,   energy   consumption,  and  ecological  footprint  of  the  Turkish  economy  for  the  1964-2018  period.  This  study  has  preferred  the  Fourier  autoregressive  distributed  lag  (ADL)  method,  which  Banerjee  et  al. (2017) introduced to the literature. The unit root processes of the  variables  added  to  the  model  were  investigated  using  both  conventional and Fourier unit root tests. As a result of the Fourier ADL  cointegration  test,  a  long-term  relationship  was  found  to  exist among the variables. The fully modified ordinary least square FMOLS) test was used to estimate the short- and long-term  coefficients.  Empirical  findings  have  revealed  energy  consumption  in  Turkiye  during  this  sample  period  to  have  increased  the  ecological  footprint  both  in  the  short  and  long  terms.  The  result  was  obtained  that  economic  complexity  increased  the  ecological footprint in the short run while decreasing in  the  long  run.  Meanwhile,  short-term  elasticity  of economic growth (0.90%) was concluded to be greater compared to long-term elasticity (0.24%), and validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis was obtained for Turkiye.

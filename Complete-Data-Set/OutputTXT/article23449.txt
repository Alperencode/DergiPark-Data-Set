Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Mobile Technology in Academic Libraries in Terms of Library Services
Özet: In parallel with the increasing use of mobile technologies, it is seen that academic libraries in developing countries have made their services compatible with mobile devices and have begun to benefit from the advantages brought by mobile technologies. From the perspective of Turkey, it is seen that the studies on this subject have not reached the desired level yet and have not sufficiently benefited from this opportunity. This research aims to reveal the use of mobile technologies by academic libraries in Turkey while providing library services. Within the scope of the research, data were collected from 258 participants through a questionnaire. The research reveals that the participants understand the importance of mobile devices in terms of librarianship services, and they need training in order to improve their skills on the subject.

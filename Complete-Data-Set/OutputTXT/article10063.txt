Makale Başlığı: Chronic Subdural Hygroma Infected with Citrobacter Youngae
Özet: AbstractIntracranial infections in the pediatric group are still important causes of morbidity in developing countries. An 11-year-old female patient with a previously impanted subduroperitoneal shunt for chronic subdural hygroma presented to our outpatient clinic with headache. Computerized tomography of the brain revealed a slight increase in the previous subdural hygroma in the right frontoparietal region. In the laboratory examination, severe C-Reactive Protein (CRP) elevation and leukocytosis were determined. The patient was operated with the prediagnosis of subdural empyema. The obtained culture results were reported as Citrobacter youngae. This is the first case of intracranial infection identified as due to Citrobacter youngae.

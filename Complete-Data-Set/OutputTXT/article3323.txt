Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of The Local Tramway Travel Within İstanbul Neighborhoods (1920-1930)
Özet: The introducion of the tram into the lives of the people of İstanbul as a modern form of transportation has generated a change in some behavioral patterns. The use of local trams have caused the people living together in the same neighborhoods, rich and poor, side by side in the Ottoman Capital to be faced with a new consumption behavior in which they were classified according to their economic status. The privilege of traveling in first class by paying more has played an important role in the economic based separation of parts of society. The analysis of the distribution of tram travels according to the passengers classes and the comparison of the differences between the districts provided substantial data about the social structure and economic conditions of the period. Between the years of 1920-1930, when first and second class trams were formed the backbone of public transportation in İstanbul, the performance of the Tram Company was determined by the comfort standards of passengers which were differed according to their classes. The trams which constituted the main routes of İstanbul throughout their working period, were evaluated separately and were analyzed comperatively. The issues such as the tram lines that were repeatedly opened and closed, the routes where the first class vehicles were insistently removed and the question of whether the use of first class vehicles were used by preference or by necessity have been examined in the light of documents and data.

Makale Başlığı: Length-Weight Relationship and Condition of Redcoat Sargocentron rubrum (Forsskål, 1775) in Iskenderun Bay (Southeastern Mediterranean, Turkey)
Özet: In this study a total of 165 (10.0-21.0 cm TL, 17.40-180.10 g TW) Redcoat, Sargocentron rubrum (Forsskål, 1775) were caught in Iskenderun Bay between September 2017 and April 2018 using a longline As a result, length-weight relationships (LWRs), sex ratio and condition the estimates for b parameter of the LWR ranged between and 3.098 3.096 and 3.100 for males, females and both sexes, respectively. Positive allometric growth were observed for male, female and both sexes. Fulton’s condition (KF) factor values also revealed not significant variations (P>0.001) for females (1.904) and males (1.926) specimens of S. rubrum. No information currently exists on the length-weight relationship and condition of S. rubrum in the southeastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. This paper is an important contribution to the science and fisheries management applications for this species.

Makale Başlığı: Geographical impact on essential oil composition of endemic Salvia absconditiflora collected from different parts of Turkey
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the content of the essential oils of Salvia absconditiflora Greuter & Burdet populations which are naturally found in Mediterranean, Iran-Turan and Euro-Sibirya phytogeographical regions. S. absconditiflora plant samples were collected from eight different provinces (Aksaray, Kahramanmaraş, Karaman, Kayseri, Konya, Niğde, Nevşehir and Yozgat) of Turkey. Essential oils of plant samples were isolated by the hydro-distillation method using a Clevenger- type apparatus and the components were determined by GC-FID and GC- MS analysis. Although the major components of S. absconditiflora were found as α-pinene, camphene, 1,8-cineole, camphor, and borneol in almost all samples β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, bornyl acetate, caryophyllene oxide, β-eudesmol and valeranone were recorded as the other important components in some samples.

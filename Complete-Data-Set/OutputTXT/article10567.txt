Makale Başlığı: Quotation and inclusion in the poetry of Shihab al-Din Ahmad al-Fayumi
Özet: This research about the quotation and inclusion of the Egyptian poet Shehab Al-Din Ahmed Al-Fayoumi, one of the scholars of the eleventh century AH, in his DIWAN of more than eighty pages, and it is still an unpublished manuscript and has not been studied and taken care of. The poet included in his DIWAN many Quranic verses; And some of them he quoted liter-ally, and some of them were partial due to the appropriateness of meaning and rhyme; This made his poetry more eloquent and gained strength and power in influencing the hearts of lis-teners in a wonderful artistic form. It also included a good number of Prophet Mohammad speech because of their eloquence and brevity, and also included many of the poetry of the famous poets in all literary eras. This is in order to benefit from their strong expressions, as he included in many Arabic proverbs because of their shortness and brevity and the beauty of analogy, representation and accuracy of meaning.The researcher has followed the descriptive analytical method in tracking the places in which the quotation was mentioned in Al-Fayoumi's Diwan and identifying its poetic purposes.

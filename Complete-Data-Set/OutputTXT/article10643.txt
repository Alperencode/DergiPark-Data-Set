Makale Başlığı: ANESTHETIC APPROACH IN CHILDHOOD FOREIGN BODY ASPIRATIONS IN OUR HOSPITAL
Özet: OBJECTIVE: Although foreign body aspirations can be seen at any age, they are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients. Anesthesia preference can range from mild sedation to general anesthesia. In this study, pediatric cases that we underwent anesthesia for foreign body aspiration were examined, and differences in terms of age, gender, hospitalization of aspirated objects and mortality were analyzed.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pediatric cases who underwent foreign body aspiration operation by the Pediatric Surgery Clinic over a 3-year period between January 2018 and December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 46 patients were included in the study. Age, gender, hospital admission complaints, duration of preoperative, quality and location of the aspirated objects, treatment methods, anesthesia duration, perioperative complications, length of stay, and mortality parameters were analyzed.RESULTS: 39.1 % of the patients were girls, and 60.9 % were boys. Their mean age was 33.47 ± 39.72 months. Although the materials aspirated varied, the most aspirated material was dried nuts at a rate of 43.5%. Intravenous anesthetics and controlled ventilation were used in all patients. While 76.1% of the patients had no complications, 10.9% had bronchospasm and 13% had a late awakening. While 89.1% of the patients went to the service after surgery, 10.9 % of the patients who developed bronchospasm were followed up in the intensive care unit.CONCLUSIONS: Complications and length of stay in the hospital do not change in cases of aspiration below and above the age of one. Anesthesia preference in patients should be considered on a patient basis. According to the results of our study, intravenous-inhalation anesthesia and controlled ventilation are also an option that should be taken into consideration.

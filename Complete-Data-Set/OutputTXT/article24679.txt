Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of Intelligent and Conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques for Uniform Atmospheric Conditions
Özet: In recent years, power generation fromphotovoltaic (PV) system has received great attention compared to otherrenewable sources. Due to nonlinear characteristics of PV cells, the maximumallowable power level from PV panel changes with atmospheric parameters whichare solar irradiance and temperature. In this context, maximum power pointtracking (MPPT) algorithms are essential to maximize the output power of PVpanel for any solar irradiance and temperature values. In the literature,various MPPT techniques have been studied to deliver maximum power from PVsystems. Hence, this study discusses intelligent control techniques, which arecalled fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and neural network controller (NNC), andcompares efficiency performance and convergence speed to conventional perturb& observe (P&O) and incremental conductance (Inc. Cond.) trackingtechniques for MPPT of PV system. In this paper, 150W PV panel model isinvestigated for different atmospheric conditions in MATLAB. Results ofsimulation show that NNC based and FLC based MPPTs have 4.66% better trackingaccuracy than conventional P&O and Inc. Cond. under standard test condition(STC). NNC based MPPT has best iteration response rate among the other MPPTsunder uniform atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the NNC based MPPT presentsbest superior quality in terms of efficiency and convergence speed for PVsystems among the other MPPTs.

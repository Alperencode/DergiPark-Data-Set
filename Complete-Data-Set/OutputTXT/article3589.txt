Makale Başlığı: THE PERCEPTION OF TURKISH WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN  PRESS IN THE ABDULHAMID II PERIOD
Özet: In this study, the newspapers in the Library of Congress, which were published in the United States, were examined. In the newspapers in addition to Demetra Vaka, Mary J. Holmes, Louise Parks Richards, Hester D. Jenkins, Thomas Stevens and Cleveland Moffett, who came to Istanbul during the reign of Abdülhamid II, there are also articles by people whose names cannot be determined.When the articles were examined, it was determined that an Orientalist language was used about Turkish women. Especially in the news about Turkish women observed in districts such as Pera, Galata and Üsküdar, it has beeb seen that the harem was discussed as well as many topics from their education, social life, marriage to weddings. The change in the perspective and perception of American travelers or writers visiting Istanbul and other big cities towards Turkish women had been tried to be determined in the newspapers. Ultimately, a perception was tried to be created by subjectively conveying the women and lifestyles of writers and travelers in Pera, Galata, Beyoğlu or Üsküdar to their readers through the American press through the “Turkish woman outside the house”.

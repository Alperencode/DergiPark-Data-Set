In the study, data were collected using the "Descriptive Information Form,” "Information Form on Breastfeeding of Twin Babies," and "Breastfeeding Intent Scale for Twin Expecting Pregnant Women." The data were evaluated in the SPSS program, using percentages, averages, and paired Student’s t-test.Results: The mean age of the pregnant women was 29.84 years (SD=5.63).

The effect size of this significant difference is 2.930, which is high.Conclusion: It was determined that breastfeeding education provided in the antenatal period affected the breastfeeding intention of pregnant women expecting twins (p<0.05).

Makale Başlığı: Perception of Historical Time in the West and Turkish-Islamic Culture
Özet: Man has measured the natural time manifested in space for his practical needs through observation and has produced the measured time, that is, the chronological time which is used to organize his social life. Chronological time, which is the common name of chronologies based on different calendar systems, has an objective structure with its translatable nature between calendars. On the other hand, historical time, which is the evaluation of time in terms of events, has a subjective structure as it is interpreted in parallel with the self-consciousness and understanding of existence of cultures and civilizations. Differences in the understanding of existence and time can also be seen within a civilization itself with the change of perspective. As a matter of fact, the perspective change that took place in the West from the end of the 18th century onwards has subsequently revealed a new understanding of time. This new (modern) understanding of time, which has spread almost all over the world with the Western hegemony, has also been effective on cultures belonging to Islamic civilization. Nevertheless, the Islamic civilization has adhered to the understanding of time based on the mabda' wa ma'ad, which has been largely abandoned under the influence of modernity, and has continued to keep this understanding alive with the Hegira calendar, the only pure lunar calendar in the world. In this study, after dealing with the attitude of Turkish-Islamic culture towards this modern understanding of time, attention is drawn to the necessity of clarifying this attitude with periodizations targeting self-consciousness in historical time, with an understanding that also takes into account the solar calendars.

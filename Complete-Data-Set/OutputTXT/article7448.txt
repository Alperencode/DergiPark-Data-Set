Özet: In this study, chemical content, antioxidant activities, enzyme inhibition activities, and DNA protection activities of extracts obtained from different solvents of the Coriandrum sativum leaf, flower and seed were determined. Total phenol and flavonoid contents of C. sativum leaf, seed and flower hexane extracts were higher than water, methanol, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts. The highest anthocyanin content was found in the flower part of C. sativum. From the antioxidant activity tests, total antioxidant activity of flower aqueous extract, reducing power of seed aqueous extract, H2O2 scavenging activity of leaf ethyl acetate extract, OH˙ radical scavenging activity of leaf hexane extract, free radical scavenging activity of flower methanol extract, metal chelate activity of leaf ethyl acetate extract, superoxide anion scavenging activity of leaf aqueous extract and lipid peroxidation inhibition activity of the leaf ethyl acetate extract had the highest. It was found that the urease inhibition activity of the seed methanol extract and the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition activities of the seed ethanol extract presented effective inhibition activity as 80.30±0.20%, 112.83±10.75 µg/mL, and 334.28±23.09 µg/mL, respectively. The leaf hexane, flower ethyl acetate, and leaf methanol extracts showed the highest DNA protection activities with values of 71.86%, 70.89%, and 69.38%, respectively. According to the phytochemical content and biochemical activity results, this study is a valuable report proving that the C. sativum plant is a natural effective product.

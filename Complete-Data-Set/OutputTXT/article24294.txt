Özet: Cappadocia Region, in the middle of Central Anatolian Plateau has had an important position throughout the history. In the same time this land has created and shaped many civilisations and showed its mentioned importance perceptibly. The region is located on a very strategical position in terms of geographical conditions and by the help of its climate many species of plants have grown in the region. Except from Melitene most of the region was under the continental climate effect. Ancient sources mentioned about herbs such as adamantis, therioarca, polemonia, Selgitic oil, botrys or ambrosia which were used for medical purposes beside common grain like wheat and barley grown for daily consumption. Also, the ancient sources give detailed information about the local growing places or even shapes of these plants. In addition to these plants and herbs the region produced some commercial plants as well. These commercial plants had contributions to the economy of the region. For example dense forest of the Caesarea region provided timber, olives were grown in Melitene and the latter city produced Monarite wine which could be compared only with Greek wine which was the most quality wine then. Diversity and richness of the plants in Cappaodcia region could be observed even today. This study focuses on the plants of Cappadocia used for medicine, commerce and nutrition in the light of ancient sources

Makale Başlığı: The Effects Of The Concept Of Perfect Belief In Hadith Commentaries On The Perception Of Religion
Özet: The phenomenon of religion might reach its goal if it is lived as a whole with the belief, discourse and action it envisages. Otherwise, it will not be easy to realize the ideals of religion on people. In this respect, it is very important to determine the principles of belief in religious teachings and what needs to be done in line with these principles. In fact, it is essential for the protection of pure religion not to allow human intervention in this matter as much as possible. However, it has become inevitable to interpret religious statements in the face of some events and developing situations in history. Undoubtedly, the commentaries in question were made to clarify some ambiguous areas or issues that could be misunderstood in religious texts. In this respect, the commentaries are extremely useful. However, it is very important that the commentaries do not allow the religious discourse to be weakened because there are some goals that religion wants to achieve on people. In this respect, it is necessary to convey the aim in question in order for the religious messages to gain a universal dimension without any loss of influence. In this study, we will focus on the commentaries on the concepts of faith and believer in some narrations and the concept of perfect faith that emerged as a result of these commentaries. At the same time, the possible effects of the concept of perfect faith on the society's perception of religion will be discussed. In addition, some points to be considered in the expression of religious texts will be emphasized.

Makale Başlığı: A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE TO THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL DISABILITY AND SOLUTION PROPOSAL: "HOUSING FIRST APPROACH"
Özet: Housing is one of the most fundamental economic and social human rights that are innate and individuals have.Housing conditions, which are one of the main indicators of the wellbeing and welfare level of an individual, are therefore tried to be developed by the social state by protecting them through social policies.One of the main goals of  social states is to enable individuals who cannot benefit from income and welfare services adequately due to physical or mental disability to access housing, which is a basic human right. In the study, the "Housing First" policy, which aims to provide shelter to individuals with mental health problems, has been examined and rights-based policy recommendations for Turkey have been constructed.In this context, a literature review has beben made and the housing conditions of individuals suffering from mental or physical illnesses in Turkey have been examined within the scope of Income Living Conditions Survey by Turkish Statistical Institute 2019 data.With the analyzes carried out, it has been concluded that this group is poorer than healthy people, they are in lower income groups, and their housing conditions are worse than healthy individuals.It has been concluded that in Turkey, which defines itself as a "social state", new policies/applications are needed to realize the right to housing of disadvantaged groups with a humanitarian response, otherwise, social exclusion due to poverty in these groups may threaten social welfare.

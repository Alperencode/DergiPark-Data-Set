Makale Başlığı: THE CULTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE HITITE CIVILIZATION REINTERPRETATION AS A PLASTIC LANGUAGE
Özet: It is possible to talk about a social structure of its own and, accordingly, a cultural understanding when humanity has existed from ancient times to the present. People who have modern living conditions from a hunter-gatherer position are defined by the culture they reveal after providing their priority problems of shelter and accommodation. The existence of cultural elements also includes the concepts of identity and belonging in the individual and social sense. From this point of view, the productions of the Hittite Civilization, which has a very important cultural place in the historical scene, are remarkable. This study, which allows the artist to examine the Hittite culture with a new perspective and to reveal his own awareness with today's techniques in this process, focuses on the main goal of keeping the culture alive. The importance of the Hittite Civilization, which has a strong and deep-rooted cultural structure, in the context of cultural memory and heritage is also included in the productions of artists from different disciplines such as Tülay Candemir, Ilgaz Özgen Topcuoğlu, Erdinç Bakla, Özdemir Yemenicioğlu and Meryem İçenli. Finally, within the scope of the study, we see that Naile Çevik reinterprets the cultural elements of the Hittite Civilization with the use of different techniques such as linoleum printing, engraving, collage, digital intervention, hand drawing and ink. These unique individual applications created by the artist allow an inspiration fed by the Hittite Civilization to be positioned in today's art as well as to be carried to the future.

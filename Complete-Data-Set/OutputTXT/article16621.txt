Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF A REALISTIC DISCOURSE: BEREKETLİ TOPRAKLAR ÜZERİNDE
Özet: The novel, which we can count as one of the fictional literary genres, besides being a work of art, turns into a communication tool as soon as it meets the reader. In this context, the novel provides striking information in terms of the society's worldview, ideology, lifestyle, culture, and human relations. Especially during periods of political, cultural, ideological, and economic breaks, the novels contain reflections on the periods in which they lived. It can be mentioned that there are many novels that have been written to bring these functions of the novel genre to the forefront, that shape Turkish literature and that arouse repercussions at the time they were written.Evaluation of such studies with a critical approach and an interdisciplinary perspective plays a very important role in understanding today's society. In the 21st century, which is called the age of linguistics, the handling of novels with different disciplines of linguistics contributes to revealing their language, ideology, and sociology richness. Examining the novels, which we can consider as a discourse, with a discipline that includes contemporary methods and techniques, such as discourse analysis, will be a sign that novels are not just a literary genre. In this study, the novel titled Bereketli Topraklar Üzerinde, which had great repercussions during and after it was written, will be analyzed according to James Paul Gee's discourse theory and discourse analysis method. It is thought that this study will provide researchers with multiple perspectives, different interpretations, and more creativity opportunities.

Makale Başlığı: The inference of jurisprudence and fundamental principles according to Damad Effendi
Özet: Damad Effendi is a Hanafi jurist who compiled the texts of Hanafi jurisprudence in his book, Majma` al-Anhar explaining the forum of al-Abhar, and he achieved the sayings in a scientific way. It has many branches, and Damad Effendi had a share of this honor as he collected the branches of the Hanafi school with explanation, scrutiny, evaluation and weighting. It is a book of jurisprudence, but the study of this book finds in its hands the principles of jurisprudence that may be complete, and two books in a book that is not free of the fundamental disagreement between the schools, indicating that Damad has a deep fundamentalist soul that helped in understanding the branches and assets in the same issue. So Damad followed a method that contradicts the Hanafi approach, which is inferring the branches with issues and rules of fundamentalism and jurisprudence. This is evidence that he considers the jurisprudential and fundamental rules as a legal evidence based on them, and although his book is jurisprudence, his fundamentalist thought was mentioned in his book of jurisprudence. The rules were collected and compared with the Hanafi approach, and the conclusion was reached on the issue.

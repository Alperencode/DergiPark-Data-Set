Makale Başlığı: Sustainability as a communication policy created by the economic system
Özet: Today's world, in which we need the effort to make it livable both in terms of material resources and spiritual satisfaction, has many other borders and layers, despite physical ones. One of these layers is understanding sustainability. In this study, the relationship between sustainability and communication has been examined. Sustainability and communication are broad topics. For this reason, the study has the characteristics of a literature review and a general evaluation. In this study, questions were asked about how these two main topics can be related since it is possible to examine sustainability in the context of communication, education, various fields of media, and even cinema. The question of how sustainability can be evaluated in parallel with brand and communication strategies is the base of the critical view on the subject. The sustainability studies of institutions and organizations, which are the cause of the main complaints about sustainability, have been the points that obscure the issue and lead to various inquiries. As a result, it is emphasized that sustainability has supra-disciplinary importance. According to the results of the study, sustainability is an issue that can be guided by communication processes and strategies and requires both individual efforts of consumers as well as public professionalism and cooperation.

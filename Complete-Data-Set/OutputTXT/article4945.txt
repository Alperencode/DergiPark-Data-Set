Makale Başlığı: Forecasting Modeling Simulation and Taguchi Analysis of The Dissemination of Covid 19
Özet: The simulation study conducted 8 different scenario analyses based on data in China. Primarily from the moment the outbreak began, the impact of the first time the measures were taken on the pandemic process was examined. Taking measures as soon as possible appeared to reduce the pandemic process. Simulation analysis of the effect of population numbers on the pandemic later found that control was easy in smaller groups and that the pandemic process could be terminated in 180 days in a 100000 populated location. In addition to different scenario analyses, the impact of parameters (transmission rate, taking measures and population number) that act on the pandemic process was examined with the Taguchi analysis. The transfer rate was found to be the most effective (35%) parameter in the outbreak process. However, there is a need to focus on the population and the length of time it takes for people with initial infections to have contact control with other people to be checked as soon as measures start to take place. According to the results of the analysis, the transmission rate of the optimum conditions is 0.2, the taking measures are taken is 10th day and population number is 100000. In this optimal condition, the pandemic process was terminated in 90 days. According to the simulation results, measures should be taken as soon as possible, dividing the population into small groups. Furthermore, the simulation result for model validation was compared to actual data, showing that the results varied closely together.

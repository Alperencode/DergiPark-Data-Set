Makale Başlığı: Preference and Interpretation of Bābertī on Issues Related to Dalālat
Özet: Dalālat al-lafẓī al-waḍʿī, is divided into three parts: mutābaqat, taẓam-mun and iltizām. Although there is an agreement among the scholars regar-ding the nature of the mutābaqat, which shows the conformity of the word to its meaning, the indication of taẓammun and iltizām includes certain controversial issues. Among these, some issues related to iltizām, which plays a central role in method and rhetoric, were discussed. Al-Bābertī who wrote al-şurūḥ [commentaries] on the main works that greatly influenced the ones written after him in these two sciences, expressed his opinion on the controversial issues; especially on the issues related to iltizām. These are about whether a mental necessity (al-luzūm al-dhihnī) condition is sought for the rationality and realization of the obligatory indication. In this context, at the beginning of the article, firstly, a general information about dalālat will be given, and in the first part, how the dalālat is handled in works of Bābertī will be explained. Then, in the second part, controversial issues related to dalālat will be discussed; views of Bābertī on these will be revealed after the discussions of scholars are included, especially within the framework of the nature of iltizām.

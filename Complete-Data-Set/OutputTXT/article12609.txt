Makale Başlığı: A Quasi-experimental Intervention Study on Student Nurses' Approaches to Complementary and Alternative Medicine
Özet: Objective: In this study, it was aimed to determine the effect of the complementary and supportive care practices course given to the students of the nursing department on the attitudes of students towards complementary and alternative medicine.Methods: The study, which was in a pre-test-post-test design with experimental and control groups and a non-randomized experimental research design, was conducted with 70 nursing students. In the study, the students who took the "complementary and supportive care practices" course included the intervention group (n=35); the students (n=35) who took another elective course that did not include information on this subject in the content formed the control group. Data were collected using the “Personal Information Form” and the “Attitude Scale towards Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine”.Results: Between the intervention and control groups, the total pretest mean scores of CTAS (48.03; 47.09, respectively) were statistically similar (p>0.05), while the medians of posttest scores (26; 48, respectively) were statistically different from each other (p<0.05). While there was no difference between the groups in terms of "Complementary and Alternative Medicine" and "Integrative Health" sub-dimensions pretest mean scores (p>0.05), there was a difference in posttest mean scores (p<0.05).Conclusion: Complementary and supportive care practices course given to nursing students increased the positive attitude of the students towards holistic complementary and alternative medicine.

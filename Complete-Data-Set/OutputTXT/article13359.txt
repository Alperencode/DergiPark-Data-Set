Makale Başlığı: Cultural elements in translated children's literature texts
Özet: In the past, while people had cultural interaction through migration, war, and trade, this interaction started to take place through literary works with translation activities. The translation texts, which have contributed to the cultural interaction and understanding of multicultural societies from the beginning to the present, form the basis of modern Turkish children's literature. Starting from this point, this research was carried out in order to determine the cultural elements in translated children's literature texts. The research is a basic qualitative study and was conducted using the scanning model. The study group of the research consists of books suitable for ages 9–12, translated into Turkish by the authors who won or were nominated for the Hans Christian Andersen Award between the years 2010–2022. In accordance with these criteria, a study was carried out on translated children's literature from five different cultures. In the texts examined in the research, many cultural elements have been identified in codes such as language, daily life, environmental space, education, entertainment, values, and beliefs. These elements are capable of creating an experience for children in terms of reflecting the culture to which the texts belong. Elements of national culture in the texts: It has been determined that it does not take place with an encouraging, dictating, or insulting expression of a different culture.

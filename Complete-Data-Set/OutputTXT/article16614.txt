Makale Başlığı: THE STRUCTURE OF THE NARRATIVE IN ANNIE SAUMONT’S SHORT STORY LA RIVIÈRE (THE RIVER) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONTEMPORARY FRENCH STORYTELLERS
Özet: ABSTRACTAnnie Saumont’s short story La rivière (The river) is narrated by an extradiegetic author-narrator and it has a current subject. It takes place in the development phase of the adventure of storytelling of the writer. It has a structure that serves as an example to French storytelling with its different aesthetic form and contemporary writing techniques. This short story has a special value because of including such techniques as the compatibility of its paratextual name, the creation of the plot based on Bachelard's work L'eau et les rêves (The water and dreams). The originality of our work is that it has given new perspectives to the development of modern French storytelling with its practical orientations, such as the different story practices of writer, and her use of linguistic structures and punctuation marks peculiar to children’s language without paying attention. In this study, we will analyze style and linguistic features of the author, fictional structure of the story, its main themes and narrative coordinates, relatively, above-mentioned story. In this analyses, we will use structuralist methodes and approches of Gérard Genette and others theoricians.

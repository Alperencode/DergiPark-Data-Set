The universe of this descriptive study consists of nurses working actively in hospitals across Turkey. The sample of the study consists of 384 nurses who accepted to participate. As a data collection tool, online questionnaire form is preferred. In addition to sociodemographic questions, “Death Anxiety Scale” and “Brief Resilience Scale” are used in the questionnaire form. It is found that the death anxiety of the participants is moderate, and their psychological resilience is above average. As a result of the analysis, it is determined that death anxiety level of women and married participants is higher than the others. In addition, a negative and moderate relationship is found between psychological resilience and death anxiety. Finally, it is discovered that death anxiety predicted resilience by 12.1%. For this reason, educational programs should be organized to raise awareness about the symptoms and consequences of death anxiety.

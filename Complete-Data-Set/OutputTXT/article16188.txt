Makale Başlığı: The Role of Women Companions in Recitation Narrations in Tafsir Sources
Özet: The sciences of the Qur'an is a versatile concept and includes many branches of science. Among these sciences are reading it, pronouncing it in the most correct way, knowing the meanings that different readings give to the sentence and acting on the provisions it contains. It is known that women Companions have a great role in the interpretation of the Qur'an and the transmission of hadiths. However, it is a matter of curiosity whether they have this competence in the science of recitation. It is observed that the isnâd system, which was determined by the muhaddis, has an important role in the transmission of the science of qira'at through teselsul. It is seen that Women Companions are relatively involved in recitation transmissions as well as in the fields of tafsir and hadith. In this study, it is aimed to clarify the issue of who the women companions who contributed to the science of recitation are, how many narrations they narrated, and whether these narrations are evaluated within the scope of sound or shad recitations.

Makale Başlığı: الصراعات المسلحة والإرهاب في ظل وباء فيروس كورونا
Özet: The coronavirus pandemic has turned into a global crisis that has shaken all global actors. Nonetheless, armed conflicts and terrorist attacks continue, unabated, during this pandemic, which is transforming the shape of these conflicts from now on. This study attempts to address two questions: firstly, how negatively or positively the pandemic affects the severity of the already existing conflicts. The prevailing belief, regarding that question, is that armed groups view the confusion, ambiguity, and lethargy caused by the pandemic as an opportunity, despite ceasefire declarations in some conflicts’ areas. The second question, which the answer to is not yet fully possible, is; how will the pandemic affect the future of conflicts involving the state, non-state armed groups, and terrorist organizations?

Makale Başlığı: Laboratory Test Paramaters and Echocardiography Findings that Affect Mortality in Hemodialysis Patients
Özet: Aim: To determine demographic characteristics, concomitant diseases, relationships between mortality and laboratory test parameters and echocardiography findings.Material and Method: Between July 2017 and July 2021, 755 patients who were undergoing hemodialysis because of chronic kidney disease regularly were inspected retrospectively. Patients under 18 years of age and patients who were undergoing hemodialysis for less than two months were excluded.Results: Age over 65 years, increased levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, red cell diameter width, alkaline phosphatase, and decreased levels of albumin, calcium, total protein and low ejection fraction (EF) in echocardiography were found to have significant relationships. There were correlation between mortality and age, albumin levels, existence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and low EF values. Conclusion: Advanced age, low albumin levels and low EF values and existence of hyperlipidemia and hypertension result in increased risk of mortality in hemodialysis patients. These patients must be carefully monitored. Anti-hypertensive medications have protective effects, and must be preferred whenever possible in hemodialysis patients.

Makale Başlığı: Gillnet selectivity for pikeperch (Sander lucioperca Linnaeus, 1758) in Suğla Lake (Konya-Turkiye)
Özet: The aim of this study was to determine the length selectivity of gillnet with 3.2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 cm mesh size fishing of the Sander lucioperca in Suğla Lake. Fieldwork was carried out in eight different stations of Suğla Lake in 2014 commercial fishing season. The Select method was used to determine the selectivity parameters. A total of 801 S. lucioperca were caught in the fishing trial length range between 15.6 and 48.3 cm. According to the bi-modal which gave the lowest deviation for gillnets, model lengths were estimated as 16.28,20.35, 25.44, 30.53, 35.61, 40.70 and 45.79 cm for 3.2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 cm mesh sizes respectively. In consideration of both MLS and length at first maturity, gillnets with fewer than 6 cm mesh size should not be used for S. lucioperca fishing in Suğla Lake.

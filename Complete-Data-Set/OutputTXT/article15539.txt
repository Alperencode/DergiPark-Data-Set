Makale Başlığı: Geophysical Analysis of Thermo-physical Properties of Rocks in Ikogosi field for Geothermal Energy Prospect.
Özet: The thermal and physical properties of rock units from Ikogosi Warm Spring (IKGWS) in the Southwestern part of Nigeria were examined in order to characterize and explore its geothermal prospect and to provide an insight into the different thermal properties of rocks of the study area. A total of 40 rock samples made up of granite, quartzite and gneiss series were collected from the outcrops of the study area and analyzed for Thermal conductivity (TC), Radiogenic heat production (RHP), Heat flow (HF), Porosity, Density and surface spring temperature measurements. The RHP values for all samples varied from 1.8 to 3.5μWm-3 with an average value of 2.5μWm-3 and standard deviation (SD) of 0.4 while the heat flow values varied from 14 to 27mWm-2 with an average of 19mWm-2 and SD of 3.4. The TC values varied from 2.95 to 4.11 with a mean of 3.49mWK-1 with a SD of 0.4 while the porosity values varied from 0.21-1.15 % with a mean of 0.62% with SD of 0.39. The density values varied from 2.68 to 2.85gcm-3 with a mean of 2.76gcm-3 and SD of 0.067. The surface temperature of the spring varied from 32 to 45°C with a mean of 38.9°C. From these results the average RHP and HF values estimated from all samples was below the 4μWm-3 and 100mWm-2 recommended value of heat to be considered for economic importance. Thus, the IKGWS geothermal field cannot be explored for power generation but for other geothermal activities and may be classified as a low enthalpy geothermal system (<150°C).

Makale Başlığı: Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis withPHILOS plate for proximal humerus fractures
Özet: Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate results, including clinical and radiological outcomes and number of complications, following minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) of proximal humerus fractures, using the PHILOS® proximal humerus internal locking system. (Synthes Holding AG, Solothurn, Switzerland).Methods: Retrospectively evaluated were 31 patients treated with MIPO (12 male, 19 female; average age: 58.4 years). Four patients had 2-part fractures, 14 patients had 3-part fractures, and 13 patients had 4-part fractures, according to Neer classification. Healing, complications, and head-shaft angle (HSA) were radiographically evaluated. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 1-year follow-up with Constant score.Results: Average Constant scores for fractured and normal shoulders were 73.2±10.9 and 84.8±5.1, respectively. Varus progression, fracture type, and age had no significant effect on functional outcome. Average postoperative and follow-up HSA’s were 130.80±7.70 and 128.80±10.00, respectively. Significant varus progression was observed during follow-up (p=0.01). Varus progression was more prominent in patients with postoperative HSA<130° (p<0.001). Inferomedial calcar screw usage, fracture type, and age had no significant effect on varus progression. Complications included 2 implant failures, 1 case of avascular necrosis (AVN), 1 primary screw cut-out, 1 axillary nerve injury, and 1 radial nerve injury (22.6% overall).Conclusion: MIPO is a safe and effective option for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures, with good functional recovery and fewer complications, which are typically technique dependent. Reduction may be difficult, resulting in varus progression. Another disadvantage is risk of axillary nerve injury. Careful surgical technique and correct implant selection is important in the prevention of nerve injury. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.16.0010This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

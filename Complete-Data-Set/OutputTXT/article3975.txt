Makale Başlığı: THE USE OF PARTICIPATION BANKING IN ACCESSING FINANCE: A RESEARCH ON DİYARBAKIR PROVINCE
Özet: Besides traditional banking in the world, İslamic finance, which is a very old but modern financial system in practice, is making steady progress within itself. The excessive borrowing created by the interest has always prepared the ground for major economic crises in the world. The İslamic financial system, which developed as an alternative to the conventional financial system, has been developing for nearly 50 years as an asset-based financing system rather than an interest-based system. Participation Banking is among the most important players of this system. In the study, the financial relations of these institutions operating as participation banks in our country with production-oriented companies and the role of participation banking in access to finance of companies operating in Diyarbakır Organized Industrial Zone were investigated. First, the demographic structures of the companies operating in the Diyarbakır Organized Industrial Zone were researched and analyzes were made in terms of how much their managers knew about Participation Banks, the reasons for the preference of Participation Banks, their contribution to the development of SMEs, and certain results were tried to be reached by establishing hypotheses. In the study, the data, which financing methods the participation banks use, the financial problems they encounter, the perception of the participation banks of the companies and the reasons for the preference of the participation banks were investigated with the face-to-face survey method. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the companies limitedly work with participation banks due to reasons such as the fact that there are no participation banks in the region where they operate and they do not have enough information about the participation banking system.

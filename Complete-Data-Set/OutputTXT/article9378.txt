Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Noise Attenuation Property of Acoustic Panel made from Recycled water Sachets
Özet: Noise and waste generally render our environment unfriendly and difficult to inhabit. There is a need to create measures for a healthy living environment. This research work evaluated the sound absorption property of an acoustic panel produced from waste Packaged in Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) materials. The waste recycling management approach from LDPE waste of water sachet materials was adopted for an acoustic panel the production by the casting method. Sound absorption coefficient evaluation of the produced acoustic panel of recycled LDPE wastes of water sachets materials gave an α value of 0.73, considered an efficient sound wave energy absorber on the scale of 0.0 – 1.0 sound absorption coefficient of materials. This study recommends a waste recycling management approach for treating LDPE material since the produced panel from the LDPE waste reduced transmitted noise and served as an effective solid waste management technique in the environment.

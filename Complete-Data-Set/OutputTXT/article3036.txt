Makale Başlığı: Right to Work and Gender Equality: Employment Creation Programs
Özet: Employer of last resort (ELR) is a Keynesian policy alternative in which state creates employment and provides the guarantee to be employed as a right. The objective of the study is to discuss the potential positive outcomes of employment guarantee policy on women’s economic empowerment and economic participation. Employment creation programs with various scopes and targets have been adopted as policies in response to high unemployment and poverty across many countries. However due to their limited scope, duration and different objectives, those programs have rather limited transformative influence compared to the ELR framework. Nevertheless the public employment creation programs implemented in the US, South Africa, India and Argentina discussed here as cases show that, despite their limited scope, programs’ impact on women’s economic empowerment and the potential they entail when they are designed from a gender aware perspective is remarkable.

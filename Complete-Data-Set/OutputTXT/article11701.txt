Makale Başlığı: THE COMPARISON OF VOCAL HYGIENE BEHAVIOURS  OF THE  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS  THROUGH VOCAL HEALTH TEST
Özet: This longitudinal study aimed to compare the vocal hygiene behaviours of secondary school students according to various variables, who pass through the voice change period and need to protect their voices in the musical education process. The data were collected from 178 students in the 2016-2017 academic year and from 119 students in the 2017-2018 academic year of a state secondary school, who were determined by convenience sampling. Vocal Health Test was used as a data collection tool in the comparison of the participants’ vocal hygiene behaviours, and the obtained data were analyzed through a t-test. The differences in the vocal health test scores of the participants were analyzed by comparing the 2017 results of the 7th-graders with those of 2018 when they became 8th graders, and also comparing the 8th graders of 2017 with those of 2018. As a result of the study, no significant difference was found between the averages of the vocal health test scores of the same group of students in terms of years and gender (p>0.05). However, a significant difference was found between the averages of the vocal health test scores of the 8th-graders in 2017 and those in 2018 (p<0.05). These findings indicate that the vocal health test results of the 8th-grade students in 2018 increased compared to the 8th-grade students in 2017 and that the vocal health test applied to the 7th-grade students in 2017 contributed to the acquisition of voice hygiene behaviors by re-administering the same 8th-grade students in 2018, which revealed that despite the unfavourable effects of the voice change period, the students’ awareness about voice health was gained. These results implicate that students should be informed about the characteristics of the voice change period during the music education process, and the voice hygiene behaviors that should be gained in order for the voice to pass into the adult voice should be emphasized.

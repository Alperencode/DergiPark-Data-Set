Makale Başlığı: A Rare Case of Conjoined Twin: Deradelphus with Review of Existing Literature
Özet: Occurrence of conjoined twins is rare but severe complication of multigestational pregnancies. Many conjoined twin pregnancies are diagnosed before reaching viability. We present a case report of a rare variety of conjoined twins i.e. cephalothoracopagus monster also called deradelphus. It was delivered to a multigravid woman prematurely at 28wks of gestation by normal vaginal delivery and was a stillborn. It was not diagnosed antenatally because of the lack of prenatal follow up. Conjoined fetuses can be detected on prenatal screening and ultrasound. This case reinforces the importance of prenatal follow up.

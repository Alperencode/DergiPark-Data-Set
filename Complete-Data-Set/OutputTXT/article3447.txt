Makale Başlığı: Brain death diagnosis and management in the COVID-19 pandemic
Özet: Purpose: This present study aimed to share experiences in the diagnosis and management of brain death (BD) and cadaveric donation cases, detected in a research hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.Materials and Methods: BD cases diagnosed between 15/03/2020-15/05/2021 in our intensive care units (ICU) were retrospectively evaluated. Patients’ demographic characteristics, primary diagnoses, ICU admission time, and length of hospital stay were analyzed. Clinical suspicion, diagnosis, declaration, and donation or cardiac arrest times and supplementary tests to support the clinical judgment performed were also evaluated. Results: 37 cases, were included in the study. Intracranial hemorrhage was the most common (54.1%) diagnosis in ICU admissions. Apnea tests could be performed only in 27 patients (73%). Cerebral CT-angiography was used as a supplementarytary test in 27 (73%) cases. Family consent for organ donation was obtained from 10 patients (27%), and 70% (n= 7) of them became donors. The time between ICU admission and BD diagnosis time was 114±92.8 (11-360) hours, the time between clinical suspicion and diagnosis was 32±15.1 (4-78) hours, the time between diagnosis and cardiac arrest of non-donors was 24±15.2 (5-72) hours, and the time between diagnosis and donation was 23±7.6 (15-35) hours.Conclusion: Occupancy in ICUs due to COVID-19 has reduced the admission of patients who may be donors to ICUs, and there has been a decrease in the number of BD detection, family approval, and organ donation in our hospital.

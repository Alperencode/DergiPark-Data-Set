Makale Başlığı: A Research on the Effect of Employees' Social Capital on Their Subjective Career Success
Özet: With this study, the contribution of the social capital of the individual in the organization in which he works to his subjective career success was investigated. In this context, the concepts of social capital and subjective career success were explained first, and then the findings of the studies in the literature on the subject and the relationship of the related variables were included. Finally, in order to examine the relationship between the variables, a total of 200 surveys were obtained from people working in financial institutions operating in Turkey and analyses were carried out through the relevant surveys. The data obtained were analyzed through the SPSS 22 program and the research hypothesis was tested. The findings obtained as a result of the analyses show that the social capital of the employees has a meaningful and positive effect on their subjective career achievements. It has been observed that the social capital of the individual gives him a lot of advantages and contributions in business. It is clear that social capital, a structure based on social networks and relationships, also provides contributions to the individual in aspects such as facilitating the exchange of resources and strengthening relationships, creating a bridge to the career success of the individual. It is thought that the study, unlike many studies conducted on the subject, will make a difference both by focusing on subjective career achievements of individuals and by using a different scale as a social capital scale, and at this point it will make both theoretical and methodological contributions to the relevant literature.

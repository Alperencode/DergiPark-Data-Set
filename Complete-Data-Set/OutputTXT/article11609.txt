Makale Başlığı: Disease names seen in XVIIIth century Turkish: According to the "Dialogues" of Pianzola (1781)
Özet: Object: In this study, it is aimed to analyze and evaluate the dialogue “With a Patient” in the work Breve Grammatica e Dialoghi Per İmparare Le Lingue Italiana, Greca Volgare e Turca “Short Grammar and Dialogues for Learning Italian, Common Greek and Turkish Languages” (1781) written in Latin letters by an Italian writer named Bernardino Pianzola (1721-1803).Method: In the study, which was designed as a qualitative research, primarily the work of Pianzola was obtained from online open sources (Google Books, Digitalen Sammlungen). A list of disease names and other concepts identified as a result of the analysis of Pianzola's work was created. The literature on the disease names of the XVIIIth century was reviewed. Here, the present-day equivalents of the words used for diseases were found. These were finalized in the study by consulting physicians who are experts in the subject. The study, which did not require Ethics Committee approval, was conducted between February 2021 and April 2022.Results: In the dialogue "With the Patient", which the author includes under the title of "Colloquium", there are concepts related to the names of the diseases, treatment methods and the patient-physician relationship. It is seen that the author did not mention the etiology of the diseases, but made some practical suggestions for the rapid treatment of the disease. Conclusion: It is thought that Pianzola's transfer of the words related to diseases in Turkish with the eyes of a foreigner is important in terms of understanding the medical concepts and information of the period.Key Words:

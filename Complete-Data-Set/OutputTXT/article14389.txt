Makale Başlığı: Neogene Stratigraphy, Environmental Interpretation and Paleogeographic Evolution of the Region between the Kınık (İzmir) and the Soma (Manisa) Districts
Özet: The northeast Aegean, in which the study area is located, was uplift in the pre-Neogene period by the effect of a N-S oriented compressional regime that controlled the closure of the northern branch of Neotethys in the north. In the Neogene, the Western Anatolian platelet has been under the effect of extensional regime in order to meet the compression, with a sharp turn to the southwest. Lacustrine basins developed in large areas from the Serravalian, and terrestrial volcanism accompanied the sedimentation that occurred in these basins. Adilköy Volcanites emplaced in the form of dykes within the Miocene Soma Formation. In the Middle Miocene, the Kalemköy Volcanites, which are intertbedded or overlain to the sediments of the Deniş Formation, have cropped out. In this study, it is aimed to reveal the stratigraphic relations of Neogene sedimentary units and their accompanying terrestrial volcanism products with each other between Kınık (İzmir) and Soma (Manisa). According to the 40K/40Ar age analyzes made from the Adilköy Volcanites (22.2 Ma) and Kalemköy Volcanites (25.5 Ma – 17.7 Ma), the Neogene volcanic activity in the region starts from the Late Oligocene and continues until the Middle Miocene. As a result, the stratigraphic relationships determined by field observations, geochronology and seismic reflection sections show that the volcanism was active until the Middle - Late Miocene. Thus, the youngest depositional age of Neogene sedimentation should be Middle Miocene.

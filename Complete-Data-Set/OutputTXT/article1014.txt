Özet: With the rise of smartphones, video games played on consoles and PCs have begun to shift into the mobile gaming industry. Today, mobile games have a larger market share than consoles and PC games in the total gaming industry and are growing with an increasing momentum. The biggest brand in the mobile game market is Tencent Games, which is part of the Chinese-origin Tencent Holding. In this research, the brand identity elements of the Tencent Games were evaluated in the context of the brand identity prism in the literature. Brand identity components are a basic supporting element in creating brand awareness, brand associations and brand equity, which can be considered as the greatest value a brand can offer, and gives an idea about what the brand wants to do and what it wants to be. The research is based on the evaluation of brand identity pyramid components such as personality, culture, self-image, physique, relationship and reflection through the example of Tencent Games in the context of case study, which is an exploratory research type. In this study, it is revealed that Tencent Games has strong brand identity elements and tries to position itself as a creative and leading brand on the basis of a culture of happiness, especially with the power it gets from mobile games. This study will contribute to the existing literature as there has not been any research on a direct product provider brand related to the game industry.

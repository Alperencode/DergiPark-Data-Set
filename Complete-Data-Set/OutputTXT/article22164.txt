Makale Başlığı: KEMALISM AND CONSTITUTION DEBATES IN YASSIADA
Özet: The aim of this article is to clarify the Kemalism understanding of the 27 May coup within the frame of the separation of powers and the 1924 Constitution. In the Yassıada Court, enacting unconstitutional statutes were described as a move against Atatürk's Principles and Revolutions. The 1924 Constitution was also interpreted to be centred on the separation of powers. The Constitution was based on unity of power, according to the defence, and how it was applied during the Single Party (CHP) Period. The concept of unity of power is not part of the May 27 coup's notion of Kemalism, and Kemalism has become synonymous with liberty. The allegations and defenses in the Yassıada Court are compared and evaluated in the consideration of the CHP and DP Programs.

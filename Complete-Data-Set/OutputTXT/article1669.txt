Makale Başlığı: Operative treatment of splint bone fractures in horses
Özet: In this study; it is aimed to present the operative treatment and results, which are indicated for the continue of their racing life in splint bone fractures which are frequently occurred in race horses. The 2nd and 4th metacarpal (Mc-II and Mc-IV) and metatarsal bones (Mt-II and Mt-IV) of the horse are accessory structures that support the carpus and tarsus. Fractures of these bones in horses are called “splint bone fractures”. Splint bone fractures are relatively common in horses and usually seen in forelimbs. Fractures of the proximal part are rarer and represent 2.7-5% of all splint bone fractures, but challenging to manage. In the present study, 5 cases of splint bone fractures in different horses were evaluated. The distribution of the fractures were Mc-II in three, Mc-IV and Mt-IV in one each. Localization of the fractures were distal 1/3 in 4 and diaphyseal in 1 horse. For the management of these fractures, surgical removal of the fractured fragments were performed under general anaesthesia. Functional limb usage was achieved following the 30th day postoperatively in all cases.

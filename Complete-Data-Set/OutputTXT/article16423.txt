Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Oxalic and Formic Acids Applied in Different Forms against the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Parasite Varroa destructor in Autumn
Özet: This study was carried out to determine different forms of the effectiveness of oxalic and formic acid applied against Varroa destructor parasite, which is seen as the main cause of colony losses and low yield in honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) worldwide. Formic acid was tested in two trial groups (FormicProTM; 70% liquid formic acid) and oxalic acid in six trial groups (Dribbling; Spray; Sublimation; Glycerine Shop towel; sunflower Oil Shop Towel; Ultrasonic Fogging). The control group was not exposed to the application during the study. According to the results, the highest effect against varroa was determined in the FormicProTM group (P<0.001). However, incubation activity of colonies almost completely ceases in formic acid groups. The rate of varroa infestation increased control group and the oxalic acid group treated with an ultrasonic fogging machine (P<0.001). In the autumn, it was concluded that not every application provided effective control against varroa at the location where the study was conducted.

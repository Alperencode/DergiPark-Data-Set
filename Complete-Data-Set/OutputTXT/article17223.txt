Makale Başlığı: $Q$-Curvature Tensor on $f$-Kenmotsu $3$-Manifolds
Özet: The object of the present paper is to consider $f$-Kenmotsu $3$-manifolds fulfilling certain curvature conditions on $Q$-curvature tensor with the Schouten-van Kampen connection. Certain consequences of $Q$-curvature tensor on such manifolds bearing Ricci soliton in perspective of Schouten-van Kampen association are likewise displayed. In the last segment, examples are given.

Makale Başlığı: The Role and Importance of Integrated Marketing Communication in Advertising: Perceptions and Evaluations of the Advertising Industry
Özet: The diversification of information gathering and application tools for brands and technology-oriented changes in the international market have necessitated renewed tactical coordination planning of all marketing communication activities and the integration of all marketing communication elements as a whole to establish integrity of messaging. The purpose of this research is to describe changes in the definition of the concept of Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) in evaluations of the advertising industry and how the decision architecture has been shaped over time. This research examines whether the definition and control of advertising campaigns should be the responsibility of the advertiser or the agency; it also evaluates the applications of the concept and future projections in the field of marketing communication. The study presents a descriptive research model employing a questionnaire conducted with managers and agency employees in the advertising sector using the snowball sampling method through the application of Google Forms. The findings reveal how IMC practices, definitions, and control processes are implemented by advertising agency employees. The results indicate that the participants, most of whom are creative directors or agency managers, consider IMC to be the tactical coordination of advertising and public relations, assuming that all communication disciplines, particularly public relations, should be in cooperation with advertising. Another notable research finding is the high (29%) rate of advertising industry professionals’ agreement that IMC control should be the responsibility of the main advertising agency.

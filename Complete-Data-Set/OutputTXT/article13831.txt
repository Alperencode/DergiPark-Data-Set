Makale Başlığı: Oinophoros Type Two Embossed Ceramic from Andriake and Some Thoughts on Them
Özet: Three pieces of embossed ceramic pieces from the oinophoros group unearthed during the excavations in the Port Buildings and ornamentation repertoire of these vessels, which are generally produced using two or more female molds, there are many scenes such as different mythological events, daily life, pastoral and still life expressions, chariot races and gladiator fights. It was determined that the oinophoros were first produced in Knidos during the Augustus Period. Apart from Knidos, it was understood that they were produced in Pergamon in the middle of the 1st century AD and in Iasos in the second half of the 2nd century AD. The oinophoros group ceramics found in Andriake belong to two different forms as phiale/patera and skyphos. As decoration, there are still life depictions with Eros in vintage associated with the Dionysus cult. Andriake samples are dated to the 1-2 century AD according to the typological analogy. It is seen that the Andriake oinophoros group ceramics are in close relationship with the Knidos samples in terms of similar examples, decoration style, clay and lining features. This situation provides important information about the distribution of oinophoros ceramics on the Lycian coasts and commercial connections between cities. It also contains clues as to the centuries and the extent of Myra's commercial connection with Knidos through the port of Andriake.

Makale Başlığı: Disappearing Bonds, Love Ethics and Living Alone in Modern Times: A Structuralist Analysis
Özet: Starting with the concept of an anxious human that the comformist ideology of the instrumental modernity has created, this article attempts at drawing attention to a set of important reflections on meaningful social bonds which we lost already, love ethics which has changed from tradition to modernity, and the choice of living alone later in life. The reader, therefore, will find some theoritical interpretations, along with some data, as to how to see close relationships sociologically, the societal function of “shame”, the conflicting structure of romantic love in modern times, the impact of social media on relationships, and eventually, the phenomenon of aging alone. Our main goal, in a sense, is to emphasize that the only therapeutic intervention against a worldwide cultural narsisism pandemy will remain insufficient without finding solutions taking the societal context into account.

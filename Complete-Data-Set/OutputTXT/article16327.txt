Makale Başlığı: Determination of Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activities of  Lavandula angustifolia Volatile Oil
Özet: This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the oil extracted from Lavandula angustifolia (Province of Denizli/Türkiye) on some gram-negative/positive pathogenic microorganisms and lactic acid bacteria (by agar well diffusion, MIC test), and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, metal chelating, FRAP). As a result of the analysis, it was determined by headspace/GC-MS analysis that eucalyptol was the highest with a value of 22.58%, α-linalool was the second with a value of 19.44% and linalyl acetate was 14.61%. Lavandulol, an essential component of Lavender, was determined by 1.39%. The highest antimicrobial effect of L. angustifolia oil was found on Bacillus subtilus and Methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) with zone diameters of 24 to 22 mm, respectively), followed by Staph. aureus. Antibacterial effects of L. angustifolia oil on Staph. aureus, E. coli, Campliobacter jejuni, Salmonella poona, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus plantarum were detected as 17, 16, 14, 14, 12, 12, and 11 mm zone diameters, respectively. Therewithal, a significant antioxidative effect was determined by DPPH, FRAP, and metal chelating analyzes.

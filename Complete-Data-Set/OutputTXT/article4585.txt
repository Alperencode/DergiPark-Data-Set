Makale Başlığı: The Problem of Incresing and Decreasing Īmān according to Imām al-Māturīdī
Özet: Abū Ḥanīfa and Imām al-Māturīdī, as representatives and two important thinkers of the Rey / Supporter of Reason mentality; were Hanafi in fiqh and  Māturīdism in the creed. They were influenced by Murjiʾa’s views on religious and legal issues and placed the principles of convenience, rationality, and equality in faith at the center of their thinking system. Even though they were highly criticized due to their definitions of the belief that exclude deeds and their rational understanding that saved the owner of great sins from denouncing, they did not stop defending these views. What is more, they facilitated the Islamization process of non-Arab Muslims with their responses to the criticisms of the opponents. In the thought of Islam, they had two different belief theories that include deeds in belief and those that do not include deeds in belief. One of the most important problems of this belief theory is the problem of ‘‘increasing and decreasing belief’’. Their intellectual discussions with Hadith Supporters, Khārijites, Muʿtazila and Shīʿa about the belief system have reached us in the relevant parts of their works. Imām al-Māturīdī, handled this issue based on Abū Ḥanīfa’s views and tried to justify it with new evidence. Therefore, In this article, Imām al-Māturīdī’s idea of whether faith increases or not with will be analyzed based on his own works.

Makale Başlığı: Does the ovarian surface epithelium differentiate into primordial follicle and primary follicle precursor structures?
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the differentiation capacity of ovarian surface epithelial cells both in cell culture conditions and in ovarian tissue sections.Materials and Methods: The ovaries of two prepubertal (4 weeks old) female rats were divided into small pieces and explant cell culture was created. Ovarian surface epithelium proliferating together with ovarian stromal cells in mixed cell culture was isolated and reproduced. In addition, ovarian surface epithelium was examined in histological sections of ovarian tissue and images were taken under the microscope.Results: The morphological appearance of the ovarian surface epithelium was found to be cobblestone. In the count performed under phase contrast microscopy, it was observed that 2x106 and 3x106 cells were grown in the culture dishes, respectively. Primordial follicle-like structures were observed in some areas of the petri dishes. On the histological sections, primordial and primary follicle precursor structures were observed on the basement membrane.Conclusion: Showing oocyte markers (Gdf-9, C-Mos, Zpc, Stella) and germ cell markers (Dazl, Vasa, Blimp1, Fragilis) both in cell cultures and in histological sections can give us valuable information in terms of monitoring the differentiation capacity of these cells.

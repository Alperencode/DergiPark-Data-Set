Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROCESS WITH A SOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE
Özet: Entrepreneurs are expressed as individuals who aims meet the needs of their cultures. The fact that the concepts of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship are closely related to each other. In every period of history, entrepreneurs have put to work the ideas that contribute to humanity in their minds. This aspect of entrepreneurial individuals is in clear parallel with Socrates's making the knowledge, thought or approach that is implicit in the minds of the people he encounters explicit and making them functional. Because Socrates considers the emergence of valuable ideas that will contribute intellectually to the person as a development that starts with pregnancy and ends with birth and also identifies the emergence of ideas. In this article, concepts that express information gathering, incubation, birth of idea, experimentation and similar developmental periods in the context of entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity are explained and interpreted in accordance with Socrates' point of view.

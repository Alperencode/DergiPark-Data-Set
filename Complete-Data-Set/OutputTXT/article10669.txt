Makale Başlığı: A New Subspecies of Dianthus pseudarmeria (Caryophyllaceae) from Türkiye
Özet: The samples collected from the Pınarhisar district (Kırklareli, Türkey) were introduced as a new subspecies for the scientific world. Dianthus pseudarmeria subsp. glabripetalus grows in oak forest clearings with an altitude of about 250-350 meters. The new subspecies are similar in terms of many vegetative and generative characters with D. pseudarmeria (subsp. pseudarmeria). However, the new subspecies differs from D. pseudarmeria (subsp. pseudarmeria) by the fact that scales of the epicalyx are striped-lanceolate or reverse-lanceolate and the petal limbin is glabrous. Conclusively, description of the subspecies, seed morphology, descriptive and explain photos, distribution, general ecological preferences are given. In addition, a suitable category of threats to the conservation of the subspecies is proposed in light of the available data.

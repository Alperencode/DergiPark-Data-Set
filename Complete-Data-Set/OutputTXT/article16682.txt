Makale Başlığı: The Effects Of Free Trade Agreements On Turkey's Foreıgn Trade: An Investıgatıon Wıth The Gravıty Model
Özet: In this study, the effects of Free Trade Agrements (FTA) made by Turkey on foreign trade were investigated. For this purpose, the effects of FTAs on  exports and imports were examined on the basis of product groups. For the period 1991-2019, 12 countries with the highest share in trade among the countries with which Turkey has made FTA are included in the study. In the study, gravity model, which is one of the methods used to explain international trade flows, was used. The results showed that FTAs have a significant effect on trade handled on the basis of product groups. On the other hand, it was determined that the distance between countries is a factor reducing trade. In addition, as a result of the estimated models, it was revealed that the gravity model is valid in Turkey's foreign trade.

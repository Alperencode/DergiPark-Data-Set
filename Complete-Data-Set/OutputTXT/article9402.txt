Makale Başlığı: The Role of Social Media in the Issue of Bayt al-Maqdis and Propping the Palestinian Approach in confronting the “Israeli” Narrative
Özet: The study aimed to identify the role played by social media platforms in the issue of Bayt al-Maqdis in strengthening the Palestinian narrative versus the Israeli narrative.  The paper focuses particularly on the period when “Battle of Sayf al-Quds” broke out between 10-21 May 2021, during the month of Ramadan.  This was a result of the Israeli occupation force’s attempt to displace Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, and the marching of Jewish settlers to storm Al-Aqsa Mosque. The study mainly used the qualitative content analysis method, with exposure to statistics that was published in social media platforms about the issue. The sample of the study was about what had been published on the platforms of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Tik Tok regarding Jerusalem on the identified period. Publications on the issues of Bayt al-Maqdis were tracked and analyzed throughout the specified period.  Which helped in revealing the role that social media sites played in the issue in terms of content and interest. The study concluded that Palestine has achieved in digital media during the Battle of Sayf al-Quds an important victory on social media platforms, by raising the events of Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and incursions into al-Aqsa Mosque to the world and becoming the global trend.

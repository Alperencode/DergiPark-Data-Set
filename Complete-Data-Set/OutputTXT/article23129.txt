Makale Başlığı: The Socio-Psychological Dimension of Hastiness, Prejudice, Stigma, and Discrimination, That Disturbs the Social Peace Environment, in the Perspective of the Qur'an
Özet: In this research, the socio-psychological dimensions of the phenomena such as haste, prejudice, stigmatization, and discrimination, which are very common in social life and disrupt social peace, were examined from the perspective of the Qur'an. In the research, the qualitative research method based on the literature on the subject was used and the data were obtained within the framework of text analysis. According to the data obtained as a result of the literature review, the absence of a study that examines the relationship of haste, prejudice, stigma and discrimination from the perspective of the Qur'an and examines it together with its socio-psychological dimension reveals the importance and originality of this research. To treat harmful behaviors such as haste, prejudice, stigmatization, and discrimination, which disrupt social peace, the Qur'an raises awareness that individual differences are manifestations of divine wisdom, young people, good thoughts, correct knowledge, judgment, patience, brotherhood, familiarity, and trust promotes tolerance and justice. Because organizing social life based on peace, brotherhood, unity and solidarity can only be possible possible by applying the moral principles envisaged by the Qur'an. In this research, a socio-psychological analysis of attitudes and behaviors that destroy social peace in the light of the universal messages of the Qur'an has been made, contributing to the literature and humanity, and an interdisciplinary perspective has been presented.

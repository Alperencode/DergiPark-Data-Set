Makale Başlığı: CANBus Based Industrial Sensor Network Design
Özet: Within the scope of Industry 4.0, the electronic systems used in the field must collect data and transfer them to the control units to be evaluated in order for the complex systems to work properly. These data, which are evaluated in the control units, enable the system to be used more efficiently and to have a long life. In addition, data collected from the field by means of devices can be evaluated for different applications by using a communication protocol designed for industry, widely used and standardized. The main purpose of this study is to design a sensor network in order to detect operator misuse encountered in overhead cranes used for carrying loads in the industrial area. In this study, CANbus communication infrastructure and CANopen protocol are used for the designed sensor network. A system for overhead cranes has been designed and the general structure of the system is shown. With the realized sensor network, from a overhead crane used in the industrial area; The weight of the transported load, the oscillation of the crane rope during transportation and the rope length data were recorded and stored in an electronic environment. The electronic storage of the data received from the sensor network has enabled long-term and continuous recording. By using the recorded data, reporting and statistical studies can be done about crane usage. In this study, the wrong practices of crane operators were determined by evaluating data obtained from the application.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECTS OF TRADE POLICY UNCERTAINTIES ON THE USA'S FOREIGN TRADE BALANCE AGAINST CHINA: AN ANALYSIS WITH STRUCTURAL BREAKS
Özet: In this study, the effects of trade policy uncertainties (TPU) on the foreign trade balance between US-China in the 2000:M01-2021:M03 period were analyzed and it was found that the balance was sustainable. Increases in the real exchange rate caused a decrease in the USA's exports to China and the sustainability of the foreign trade balance of US. It was determined that the increase in TPU in the US and China did not have a significant effect on the US's exports to China and the foreign trade balance. The causality determined in the Toda-Yamamoto (1995) test from the real exchange rate to the foreign trade balance of the US points at the justification of the US's efforts to make China stop suppressing the value of its national currency. The fact that there is no causal relationship from the TPU in the USA and China to the foreign trade balance of the US shows that the aggressive foreign trade policies implemented by the US are of no use. The causality relationships from the real exchange rate and the US's TPU to the US's imports from China show that the US's heterodox foreign trade policies can only affect its imports from China, and its exports to China were determined by the China's internal dynamics. The causality relationship between the real effective exchange rate and China's TPU indicates that an important source of the TPU in China is the exchange rate policies of China

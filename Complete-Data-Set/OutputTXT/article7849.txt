Makale Başlığı: Teachers’ use of academic research databases and its relationship to their research skills and performance
Özet: This descriptive-correlational study aims to determine the relationship between teachers' use of academic research databases, research skills, and teachers' performance. Research teachers in public secondary schools under the Pagadian City division, Philippines, were selected as participants for the survey. The results showed a strong positive correlation between teachers' use of academic research databases and research skills. However, teachers' performance has no relationship with research skills and teachers' use of academic research databases. Since teachers' use of academic research databases and research skills among the teacher-participants of this study were not related to their very satisfactory performance, teachers may have been developed successfully due to the Department of Education's reinforced programs, training conferences, and workshops.

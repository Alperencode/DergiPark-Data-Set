Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Colostrum Quality in Different Bovine Breeds
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to compare and determine the quality of colostrum by brix refractometer in the postpartum period in 4 different cattle breeds (Holstein, Jersey, Simental, Danish Red). In the study were used 107 colostrum samples that from 4 different breeds of cows, 56 Holstein, 29 Jersey, 12 Simmental and 10 Danish Red. Colostrum brix refractometer was used to determine the colostrum quality and the results were expressed as % ratios. In the study, the differences between breeds in terms of colostrum brix value were statistically significant (P<0.05). According to the breeds, the highest colostrum brix value was determined in the Simmental breed (27.8 %), followed by the Danish Red (27.5 %), the Holstein (27.2 %) and the Jersey breed (26.0 %), respectively. In the study, the effect of lactation number, dry period lenght, calf birth weight and calving season on colostrum brix value was not statistically significant (P>0.05). In the study, it was concluded that the colostrum brix value differed between breeds, but the effect of other factors examined on this parameter was not significant.

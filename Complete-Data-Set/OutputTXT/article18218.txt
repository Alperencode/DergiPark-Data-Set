Makale Başlığı: Effects of Cluster Thinning on Cluster Properties and Yield in Vineyards with Different Slopes and Rootstocks
Özet: This study was carried out for two consecutive years in the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 vegetation periods in the vineyard. The trial area is located within the coordinates of 40° 39' 12.00" N and 27° 03' 20.00" E which is located in the Sarkoy county of Tekirdag province. Cabernet Franc vines grafted onto 13-year-old Fercal and 140 Ru rootstocks were used. Vines planted at 2.1 m X 1.0 m distance between and above rows, height of trunk is 70 cm, Espalier system in the form of a single-arm Cordon Royat trellising and in N-S direction. The altitude of the vineyard is between the highest 327 m and the lowest 309 m. In this study; the effects of rootstock, location, cluster thinning applications on cluster characteristics were determined. In the conditions of Sarkoy county of Tekirdag province, low values were obtained from the Fercal rootstock in terms of cluster characteristics, except for the number of berry per cluster. In terms of the location on the slope, the “Top” location gave a high value in terms of the number of berry in the cluster, while it had a lowering effect in all other criteria. Therefore, when Cabernet Franc/Fercal combination, low cluster width, cluster length, cluster weight, cluster volume and cluster density are desired in sloping vineyards, it has been found that the “Top” location in slope can be preferred and it is recommended not to do the cluster thinning in order to avoid lower yield.

Makale Başlığı: Examination of Some Factors That May Affect Learning and Memory in the Space Environment
Özet: Mankind has always wondered and observed space from ancient times to the present. Finally, these observations have evolved to go into space since the early 1900s. During the Cold War years, with the mutual moves of the Americans and the Russians, satellites, animals, and humans were sent to orbit, and finally, humans were sent to the moon and this race gained a great momentum. Space is an extreme environment for human beings living on earth (who performs all their evolutionary processes on earth) and it affects people who go to space (astronauts and cosmonauts) physiologically and psychologically. In this review; the effects of microgravity (the resulting weightlessness), radiation (cosmic radiation, solar flares, etc.) isolation and some other factors (such as gender, culture, and language) on learning and memory processes have been tried to be examined.

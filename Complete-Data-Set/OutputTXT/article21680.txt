Makale Başlığı: Rough Sets Based Spatial Analysis for Metal Production Area at Mount Nif
Özet: Nif (Olympus) Excavation Project has four different excavation areas where southeast of Nif Mountain, located in the east of Izmir, Turkey. A significant spot of the project is Karamattepe, defined as a rural metal production area in the Archaic Period, which outshines rich metal finds such as nearly 500 pieces of iron and bronze arrowheads, metal production furnaces, and slags. Albeit mentioned context seems suitable to spatial analysis, per contra, the area which has a natural incline in the North-South axis, had even been used as agricultural land for approximately 100 years in the modern period. As known, both natural slope, and agricultural practices such as plowing and spudding in archaeological sites cause translocation, especially in small finds. Under these circumstances, the context does not seem suitable for spatial analysis with deterministic methods. The goal of the study is to understand the specs of the rural metal production area at Karamattepe by spatial analysis. Studied data include geolocations of arrowheads that are obtained from GIS, their Euclidean distances to the furnaces, various metrics (weight, length, i.e.), and analogical typology as inputs. With the proposed Rough Sets-based approach, the relation between metal finds and production points is determined. It is thought that this study will shed light on the researchers to cope out multi-dimensional uncertainties for spatial analysis in landscape archaeology.

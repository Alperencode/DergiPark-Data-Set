Özet: The previous name of Emre village, which is located within the borders of Kula district of Manisa today, was Emre Sultan. The village was connected to the Saruhan sanjak Adala district in the middle of the 19th century. With this study, the social and economic situation of the village in the years 1844-1845 is tried to be revealed. The main source of the study is the village temettüat book in the Ottoman Archives. Population registers and other archival records of the village were also used. The secondary objective of the study is to determine whether there is information about Yunus Emre or Tapduk Emre in the archive records of the village. According to the temettüat book, Emre Sultan village has 43 households and a population of approximately 215. When the names of 43 household heads were examined, a total of 13 different names were used. The most used names are Mustafa, İsmail and Ali. When examined in terms of occupations, it is seen that 33 out of 43 household heads are engaged in agriculture. There is one imam and one teacher in the village. There is only one blacksmith as a tradesman. The total agricultural land of the village is 3,169 acres and just over half of it is cultivated land. Most wheat, bonito and barley are produced in the village in terms of value. The total number of animals is 476. The total net income of the village in 1844 was 103,357 kuruş. The total annual tax paid is 23,722 kurus. The economy of the village is largely based on agricultural activities. No information that could be related to Yunus Emre was found in the examined temettüat and population books. There are Emre Sultan Lodge and people associated with this lodge in the village.

Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Analysis of the Semantic Field in Rabatak and Orkhon Inscriptions
Özet: Unlike hitherto conducted onomastic studies on the Old Turkic and Middle Iranianlanguages of historic period, this study includes a comparative semantic field analysisof the vocabulary attributed to shahs and qagans in Rabatak and Orkhon inscriptions.In the “Introduction” section of the study, the term “semantic field”, which outlines thetheoretical framework of the study, has been described, and the attention drawn to theearly period interactions between the Bactrians and the Turks. In the “Analysis” section,the words and phrases defining the shahs and qagans have been collected under the titleof the semantic fields of “abstract concepts”, “connection” and “management qualifications”.It has been determined that there is a vocabulary that associates the shahs and theqagans with a divine power in the semantic field of “abstract concepts”. In the semanticfield of “connection”, it has been determined that there is a vocabulary that gives informationabout the society and family members. Also, in the semantic field of “managementqualifications”, a vocabulary that articulates the positive characteristics of the shahs andqagans has been determined to function. In the last part of the study, a comparison hasbeen made between vocabulary of the Rabatak and Orkhon inscriptions. Based on thecomparison, it has been observed that the vocabulary in the Rabatak inscription defines“the shah Kanishka” with his self-characteristics whereas the vocabulary in Orkhon inscriptionsdefines Turkish qagans in terms of the opportunities provided to the public. Inaddition to this, different from the Rabatak inscription, it has been noted that the Orkhoninscription includes the vocabulary that defines women rulers.

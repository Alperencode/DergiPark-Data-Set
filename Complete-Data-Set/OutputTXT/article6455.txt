Makale Başlığı: The Mediating Role of Organizational Commitment in the Effect of Emotional Labor on Turnover Intention: A Study on Food and Beverage Businesses
Özet: Emotional labor is especially important in the service sector. In food and beverage enterprises where emotional labor is intense, this situation reveals the problem of turnover intention. This study aims to investigate the mediating role of organizational commitment in the effect of emotional labor on turnover intention. The research was conducted on 312 employees working in food and beverage enterprises between 11.11.2021 and 10.01.2022. Unlike previous studies, sub-dimensions of variables were also included in the analyses. SPSS and Process v4.0 were used to analyze the data. According to the analysis results, organizational commitment has a mediating role on the surface and naturally acting dimensions of emotional labor on the turnover intention. However, no mediating role of organizational commitment has been found in the effect of the deep acting dimension of emotional labor on the turnover intention. Research results show that organizational commitment is essential for food and beverage businesses. Organizational commitment can be a solution for the stress and turnover problem created by emotional labor.

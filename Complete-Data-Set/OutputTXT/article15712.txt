Makale Başlığı: LITHIC ASSEMBLAGES OF LOCALITY 028 (GBT-028) FROM PLEISTOCENE GÜRGÜRBABA HILL, ERCİŞ - VAN
Özet: The Gürgürbaba Tepesi-028 (GBT-028) open-air site is located in the Meydan mountain area, in the Erciş district of Van province, on the high plateau of eastern Turkey. The lithic assemblages of GBT-028 was dated to Lower Paleolithic period, which was determined during the survey in 2014. Since then, intensive survey was done in the area in 2019 and with a total of 2,060 obsidian lithics remains were analyzed. The large cutting tools, large flakes and their debris, and the prepared core industry were indicated that this region was inhabited by late Acheulean people and the site was used as a workshop area. Although GBT-028 has not been directly radiometrically dated, the base of the GBT-028 site was dated to 424.000 years ago, indicating that this location was in use roughly after this date. Additionally, GBT-028 is located on the same living floor as GBT-010, suggesting that it originated from GBT-010 and could be 311,000 years old. This will be crucial in terms of improving our understanding of the late Acheulean period and providing precise information on the behavioral activities of the people of the Pleistocene period.

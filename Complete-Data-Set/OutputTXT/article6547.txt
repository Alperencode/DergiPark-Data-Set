Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Sleep Quality of Midwifery Students in the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
Özet: relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and sleep quality of midwifery students during the Covid-19 pandemic.The sample of the descriptive and correlational study consisted of 280 students studying at the Department of Midwifery at the Faculty of Health Sciences of a public university between 11.02.2021-11.03.2021 who agreed to participate in the research. Data were collected online via Google Forms “Survey Form”, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12)” and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)” generated by the data. Data were evaluated with SPSS 22.0 package program mean, percentage, and Pearson Correlation Analysis.The mean age of students included in the research was 20,.80±2.09, It was determined 27.9% of them were in the 1st grade, 24.6% in the 2nd grade, 26.4% in the 3rd grade, and 21.1% in the 4th grade. 73.2% of the students stated that their sleep time changed compared to the pre-pandemic period, and 55.7% stated their sleep time increased. The mean IUS-12 total score of midwifery students was found to be 36.75±9.41, and their level of intolerance to uncertainty was found to be moderate. The total PSQI score average was 14.1±8.46, and it was determined that the students had poor sleep quality according to this average score. There was a weak positive correlation between students' intolerance to uncertainty and total sleep quality score (r:0.269 p:0.000).The sleep duration of the students increased compared to the pre-pandemic period. It is thought that the duration of sleep increases due to the increase in the number of days students stay at home during the online education process.

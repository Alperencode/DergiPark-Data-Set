Makale Başlığı: Factors effect infant mortality under structural breaks: evidence from African countries
Özet: Infant mortality rate is one of the important indicators reflecting the development levels of countries. This ratio is used to compare health levels among countries. In this study, the effects of GDP per capita and urbanization rate on infant mortality rates in 5 African countries (Algeria, South Africa, Sudan, Nigeria, and Egypt) were examined within the scope of 1990-2019 data. Panel Fourier Unit Root Test developed by Nazlıoğlu and Karul (2017) and panel cointegration test with structural break developed by Westerlund and Edgerton (2007) were used in the analysis, which takes into account structural breaks. The estimation of long-term coefficients was estimated using the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) method developed by Pesaran (2006), which takes into account the inter-sectional dependence. The findings show that the cointegration coefficients of per capita income and urbanization rate in these countries are statistically significant. Across the panel, the 1% increase in per capita income reduces infant mortality by about 0.025%, while the 1% increase in urbanization increases infant mortality by about 3.283%. The estimation results show that policy makers in African countries should consider problems such as clean water, sanitation, insufficient health personnel and health institutions, and support policies in this direction.

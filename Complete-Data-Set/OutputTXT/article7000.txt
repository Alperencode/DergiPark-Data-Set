Özet: Objective: With the understanding of the value of water buffalo products and the effect of the projects implemented in Türkiye after 2010, water buffalo breeding has gained importance. This research aims to analyze economical aspect of the water buffalo farms within the scope of the Buffalo Breeding Project in the Hands of the People in Balıkesir province.Material and Methods: The data was obtained through face to face questionaire from 102 producers in the districts of Altıeylül and Gönen of Balıkesir Province in which buffalo milk production was done intensively. Within the scope of the research, whether there is a difference between the characteristics of the water buffalo farms according to the size of the farms (1-10 heads, 11-20 heads and 21 heads and above) was statistically tested with Kruskal-Wallis test.Results: In the study, average milk yield was found as 1332.89 kg in one lactation per buffalo. This amount is above the Türkiye’s average of 2019 (1000.10 kg). The total daily feed consumption is 12.32 kg per buffalo. According to the average of farms, net profit per animal unit is 1484.31 TL. It has been determined that the gross profit of the small size enterprises was higher, and these farms convert the milk into value-added products and market them in line with their own possibilities. Conclusion: According to the results, for the economic sustainability of buffalo farming, it is necessary to supporting the sector and direct the producers to the buffalo products with high added value. Thus, migration from villages to cities will be prevented and producers will be able to breed buffaloes under more modern and technical conditions.

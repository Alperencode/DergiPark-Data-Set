Thus having a dominant role throughout the world. Especially after the Second World War, Hollywood, which also included the ideological and cultural values of different ethnic origins, expanded its product range and gave every class or segment the opportunity to express themselves in a cinematic perspective. One of them, afrofuturism, is a movement that re-imagines the future of Africa and the African diaspora. This movement can be found in many fields such as cinema, literature, visual arts and popular music. In the afrofuturist art movement, where an alternative world is imagined, national borders are abolished through sci-fi, fantasy and cyber-culture (technology), and the transformation in information and communication technologies is placed at the center of utopia. In this context, throughout the study, the philosophical and aesthetic myth forms of afrofuturism on Hollywood will be examined and it will be tried to find out with which codes this atmosphere is provided in the core of the afrofuturist project.

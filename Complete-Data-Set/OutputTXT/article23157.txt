Makale Başlığı: Beroje, Sahip. Sünnet İnkârcılığı Bizi Nereye Götürür? (Where Does Sunnah Denial Take Us?) İstanbul: Ensar Neşriyat, 2020. 199 Pages, ISBN: 9786257320016
Özet: The two main sources of all Islamic sciences are the Qurʾan and the Sunnah. All Islamic scholars since the companions have agreed on this issue. Although a religious understanding based on the Qurʾan emerged from time to time in the history of Islamic thought, such an understanding never completely excluded the Sunnah; disappeared before becoming a systematic and effective movement. However, starting from the 19th century, a more systematic and effective formation denying Sunnah has emerged. This formation is different from the others in that it completely denies the sunnah and is more systematic. In his book titled “Sünnet İnkârcılığı Bizi Nereye Götürür?” (Where Does the Denial of the Sunnah Take Us?) Sahip Beroje, a professor of Islamic Law, draws attention to what kind of consequences the ideas put forward by those who have this thinking will have in the future. In this article, short review and analysis of the aforementioned book will be presented.

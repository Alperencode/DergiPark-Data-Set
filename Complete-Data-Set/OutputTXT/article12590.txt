Makale Başlığı: The Liberal Virus: Permanent War and the Americanization of the World
Özet: Egyptian-French Marxist critic and economist Samir Amin, one of the founders of Dependency Theory, focuses especially on the problems experienced by the Third World countries and the domination of the center over the periphery. In his book, The Liberal Virus: Permanent War and the Americanization of the World, he acts on the premise that liberalism has become the ideological background of brutal capitalism in the hands of great powers, no matter how it is presented. In this direction, he emphasizes that Europe and Japan, especially the United States of America, constitute a triple power of exploitation in today's world, and that the leader of them is the USA. Only in the Turkish edition of the book there is a second chapter titled ‘The World System in Transformation’. In the second part, Amin takes a closer look at international institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization and NATO, which are mentioned in the first part. He mentions that these, as institutions serving the triple power, expand the dimensions of crises and exploitation in the surrounding countries. He also focuses on solutions that will save Third World countries from the liberal virus.

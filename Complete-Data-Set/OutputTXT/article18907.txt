Makale Başlığı: Four Important Sûfi Terms in The Risale-i Nur Collection
Özet: The issue of “velâyah” has been deeply examined in many places and discussed from different aspects in the Risâle-i Nûr Collection. Said Nursi not only explained “velî” as a mystical term, but also explained the terms “ârif”, “abdal”, and “qutb”, which had distinguished positions in the hierarchy of “velî”s, and emphasized the detailed points by explaining their meanings. In the present study, the meanings of the four Sûfi terms in Sûfi terminology were summarized briefly, their equivalents in the Risâle-i Nûr Collection, their meanings, in which aspects these concepts were discussed in many places, and whether they were evaluated from the same point of view with Sûfism were discussed. It was also underlined in the study that these terms were explained broadly by Said Nursi, sometimes with some criticisms about their misunderstanding or interpretation because these four Sûfi terms are of great importance in the spiritual hierarchy of the Sûfis. In the present study, the explanations in Risâle-i Nûr about these four important Sûfi terms consisting of “ârif”, “abdal”, “velî” and “qutb” were discussed. And finally, it was revealed that these terms are used to express the same meanings in Sûfism in the Risâle-i Nûr Collection and are accepted as concepts that indicate the same high spiritual positions, and the Sûfis who reach the rank indicated by these four terms are accepted as distinguished people who have attained high levels. Although these four mysticism terms, which express the high levels that the devotee may desire to reach as a result of the travels in Sûfism, were handled as supreme spiritual positions in the Risâle-i Nûr, Said Nursi stated that there was no need for the students of the Risâle-i Nûr to take this travel because Gavs’ul Azam Abdulkadir Geylani was the owner of the secret of “individuality” as the spiritual person of the Risâle-i Nûr. On the other hand, these important terms of Sûfism were also accepted as an indicator of being a perfect human being, just like the high positions in which they were accepted in the hierarchy of Sûfism.

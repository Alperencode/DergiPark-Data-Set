Makale Başlığı: Orhan Pamuk’s Veba Geceleri and Nation as a Fiction within a Fiction
Özet: This study aims to interpret Orhan Pamuk's novel Veba Geceleri (Plague Nights), published in 2021, through the conceptual framework and debates of nationalism studies. The novel is about Minger Island– a fictional city that involves both Muslim and Christian populations in the Ottoman Empire and the social and political turmoil caused by the plague epidemic on the island which caused the rise of nationalism and the independence of the island. Moreover, the narrative presents a potential to reveal the fictional aspects of the historical realities facts by standing on the modernist perspective which defines nations as construction by nationalism and considers the acceptance about history of the nations.

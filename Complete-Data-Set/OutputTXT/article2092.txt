Makale Başlığı: Establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region as a Result of the Armenian Occupier Activities
Özet: The article explores and analyzes the historical aspects of the establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region in Azerbaijan. This issue is assessed as a result of the Armenian aggression. After the Bolsheviks seized power in Azerbaijan in 1918-1920, the Dashnaks waged a war for territory with the Republic of Azerbaijan, and finally achieved the establishment of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic at the expense of Azerbaijani lands. During this period, the Armenians could not capture Karabakh. Even the Bolsheviks understood that this was impossible. However, the granting of autonomy by the Bolsheviks to the small number of Armenians living in Karabakh in the territory of Azerbaijan and the establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region made the Armenians even more ambitious for the lands of Karabakh. In the process of the collapse of the USSR, the wrong position of the Soviet leadership in the field of national relations led to the resumption of attempts by certain nationalist forces within the empire to assert territorial claims. Moscow-backed Armenian nationalist forces expanded their activities to seize the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh region refused to submit to the Azerbaijani state, citing the right of nations to self-determination. On the eve of the collapse of the USSR, the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, one of the most acute national conflicts of modern times, arose, which was the bitter result of the “activities” of the Russian Bolsheviks together with the Armenian Dashnaks in the 1920s.

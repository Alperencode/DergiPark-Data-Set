Makale Başlığı: Post-international Intervention Libya: The Challenges Against State-Building
Özet: The most critical and dangerous prospect for the revolution is that Libyans not only overthrow the Gaddafi regime but also destroy any representation of contemporary power and its center that lacks firm roots in Libyan soil and culture. The revolution and war caused widespread devastation, necessitating a start from scratch. However, due to the Libyan context and situation, this attempt is hampered by numerous impediments related to historical, natural, and geographical contexts to the extent of tribalism and external interference. This has resulted in the emergence of tribal, local, and regional tendencies that are sometimes contradictory but persistent. This makes the process of disarming and integrating militants into state institutions a dangerous endeavor that threatens and impedes the establishment of state institutions necessary for the democratic transition process to succeed and significantly impedes the establishment of the new political system. This article aimed to analyze Libya’s future in the post-international intervention context by looking at the democratic transition and state-building challenges, the impact of the crisis on economic activity and oil production, and weak institutional structures and modernization requirements.

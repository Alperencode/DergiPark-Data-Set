Makale Başlığı: Acute Effects of Sodium Pyrithione (Sodium Omadine) on Rat Liver and Kidney Tissues
Özet: In this study, the histological effects of intraperitoneally applied sodium pyrithione (35 and 70 mg kg-1, ip) and saline (0.09% NaCl 0.5 ml kg-1, ip) on the kidney and liver tissues of rats in 24 and 96 hours were investigated. As a result of the study, it was concluded that intraperitoneally applied sodium pyrithione may have a cytotoxic effect that causes histopathological changes due to the increase in dose and duration ,when compared to the control group,.

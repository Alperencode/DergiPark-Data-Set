Makale Başlığı: Arias-Stella reaction and frightening cytological changes in endocervical polyp: a rare case report
Özet: The Arias-Stella (AS) reaction is hormone-dependent atypical endometrial changes characterized by hyperplasia, hypertrophy, vacuolization, pronounced nuclear atypia, pronounced nuclear pleomorphism, and prominent nuclear hyperchromasia in glandular epithelial cells. It is very rare to see AS-related changes in extra uterine areas, especially in an endocervical polyp. Since this benign lesion is very similar to misdiagnoses such as adenocarcinoma, it is very critical to recognize AS reaction in extrauterine areas. The interpretation of pathological findings involves many difficulties, for example, due to the generally small size and fragmentation. Considering the clinical history and good interpretation of the nuclear details are extremely important for correct diagnosis. Here, we present the frightening cellular changes associated with AS observed in an endocervical polyp encountered after abortion in a middle-aged pregnant woman, together with the literature findings.

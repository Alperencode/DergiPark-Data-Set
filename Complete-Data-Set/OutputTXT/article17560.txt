Makale Başlığı: AGENSTS’ EXERCISING THE POWER OF REPRESENTATION IN THE MEDIATION PROCESS
Özet: In accordance with Turkish Commercial Code (TCC) Art. 105, 2, an “agency can sue on behalf of its client for disputes arising out of the contracts it brokers or makes, as well as against it in the same capacity”.In contrast, disputes arising from these contracts are likely to be subject to mediation as a procedural requirement according to TCC Art. 5/A and The Code on Consumer Protection (CCP) Art. 73/A before being brought to the path of litigation. Within the framework of this study, it will be tried to clarify whether the provision TCC Art. 105, 2 can be applied during the mediation process and what the scope of the rights, powers and obligations of the agency will be in this process if it is to be applied.

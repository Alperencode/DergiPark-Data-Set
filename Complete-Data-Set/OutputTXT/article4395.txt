Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS OF LEGAL REGULATIONS ON CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES OF HOUSEHOLDS IN TURKEY: OAXACA-BLINDER DECOMPOSITION FOR THE YEARS 2007 AND 2019
Özet: Turkey is one of the countries with a high level of tobacco use. Although some legal arrangements have been made to address this issue since the mid-1990s, the most significant step taken in this regard was Law No. 5727 in 2008. The purpose of this study is to look into how regulations on tobacco use affect households cigarette consumption expenditures in Turkey. In this study, in which the 2007 and 2019 data of the Turkish Statistical Institute Household Budget Survey were used, the sources of the change in the cigarette consumption preferences and expenditures of the households between the mentioned years were revealed by considering some socio-demographic variables with the Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition method.The results show that the legislative regulations enacted between 2007 and 2019 did not have the desired impact and there was an increase in household cigarette use choices and expenditures. On the other hand, it was found that the restrictions on cigarette consumption in married families, middle-aged and above, and with undergraduate-graduate degree level indicate, albeit partially, the impact of the legislation.

Makale Başlığı: Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer In Working Life: An Application On Generations X And Y
Özet: Transferring the knowledge of employees to other generations is of vital importance for the sustainability of businesses. Since generational differences are an important factor that can affect knowledge transfer, it is very necessary to examine the knowledge transfer relationship between employees from different generations working together in the workplace. For this purpose, answers to two basic questions seek an answer in the study. Is there a meaningful relationship between generations and knowledge transfer behavior? And do the generational differences of the employees affect the knowledge transfer behavior? In this direction, data was collected from X and Y generation employees in businesses operating in various sectors such as food, security, and automotive in Ankara. SPSS 22.0 statistical program was used for the analysis of the collected data. As a result of the research, it was concluded that there is a significant relationship between generations and knowledge transfer behavior and that intergenerational differences affect knowledge transfer behavior. In addition, it has been determined that the information transfer behaviors of the employees differ according to their total experience in the profession and their education level.

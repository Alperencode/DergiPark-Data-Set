Makale Başlığı: Investigation of some enthomopathogens as biocontrol agents of Tinocallis (Sappocallis) saltans (Nevsky, 1929) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
Özet: In Turkey, Tinocallis (Sappocallis) saltans (Nevsky) on Ulmus glabra Hudson was detected for the first time, and it was determined that it caused a considerable amount of damage. The study was conducted for the purpose of determining the usability of enthomopathogens in the control against it, while avoiding the negative effects of chemicals on the environment and human health. A total of 12 bacteria strains were tested for control efficacy and verified: Brevibacillus brevis (2), Bacillus thuringiensis (1), Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kenyae(2), Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstakii (2), Bacillus subtilis (1), Pseudomonas chlororaphis (1), Bacillus sphaericus GC subgroup D (1), Pseudomonasfluorescens biotype C (1), Bacillus atrophaeus (1), and 1 fungus isolate (Beauveria bassiana). The trials were carried out in 2 different forms: under controlled conditions and under field conditions. Data showed that the mortality rates were between 12.84% and100% in controlled condition and between 7.72% and 31.79% in field condition over the 72 h period. B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstakii (FDP-41), B. subtilis (EK-7), and B. thuringiensis subsp. kenyae (FDP-42) were the most effective bacterial strains against the aphids in controlled conditions. The percentage of mortality related to these applications was 100% in 48 h in controlled condition. However, the effectiveness of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstakii (FDP-41) was 31.79% in 72 h in field conditions. On the other hand, fungal isolate B. bassiana (ET 10) suppressed the harmful population significantly in controlled conditions (86.64%); however, it was less effective in field conditions (13.04%). As a result, it was concluded in the present study that these bacteria strains may be used successfully as bioagents in the biological control against T. saltans.

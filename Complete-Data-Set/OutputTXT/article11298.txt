Özet: The work, titled Yavana: The Great Basin of Islamic Civilization/Indian”, divides the adventure of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent into three main sections: “Recognition (Ghaznavids)”, “Settlement (Delhi Turkish Sultanate)” and “Rooting (Mughals)”. It aims to examine the contribution of the region to the Islamic civilization in artistic terms. In general, "Yavana", which presents the reader with a holistic picture of the Turkish-Islamic scientific basin in the Indian subcontinent, is a valuable study that sheds light on what can be done to researchers about the Indian basin. However, it is necessary to explain why the study was named by the Indians with the concept of "Yavana", which is used as a negative characterization for Muslims in the sense of "other, foreign, invader, rude, ignorant" to express that they are inferior to them. Although it is remarkable, it is not possible to say that the naming is compatible with the content.

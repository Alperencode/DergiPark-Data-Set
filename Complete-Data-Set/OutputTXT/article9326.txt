Makale Başlığı: The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and hypertensive organ damage
Özet: Aim: In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between vitamin D level and target organ damage (TOD) in primary hypertension patients by eliminating the effects of hypertension duration and antihypertensive treatments.Material and Method: The study included 144 patients with primary hypertension. Vitamin D levels were classified as sufficiency (VDS), deficiency (VDD), and severe deficiency (VDSD). In case of more than one TOD indicator (microalbuminuria or proteinuria, left ventricular mass index and carotid intima-media thickness), it was considered as multi organ involvement (OI). In the multiple regression model, besides the traditional risk factors, the effects of hypertension duration and anti-hypertensive treatments were adjusted.Results: The rates of VDS and VDD were lower in TOD (+) compared to TOD (-) (14.1% vs 51.5%, 32.1% vs 42.4%; p<0.001), while VDSD ratio was higher (53.8% vs 6.1%, p<0.001). VDSD ratio was higher in hypertensive patients with single-OI compared to TOD (-), while its was higher in patients with multi-OI compared to single-IO. In the multivariable regression model; showed that 1 ng/mL decrease in the Vitamin D increased the probability of TOD by 1.22 folds [vs TOD (-)], probability of single organ involvement by 1.19 folds [vs TOD (-)], and probability of multi-IO by 1.11 folds (vs single-IO).Conclusion: In hypertensive patients, a decrease in vitamin D levels is associated with an increase in TOD indicators. The risk of developing TOD and multi-IO is higher in vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplements may be beneficial in hypertensive organ damage, regardless of disease duration and anti-hypertensive treatments.

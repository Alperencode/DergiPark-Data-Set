Makale Başlığı: In Orienting Youth to Good Benefiting from the Principles of Futuwwa and Halvet der-Encümen
Özet: Youth is the most dynamic and exciting period of human life. Dynamism and excitement,which are the characteristics of this period, are factors that multiply the effects ofpositive and negative thoughts, goals and actions in young people. Young people shouldbe guided towards positive goals that will make them happy, without falling into harmfuland bad habits that result in addiction. One of these goals should be to have a career, andthe other and more importantly, to adopt an understanding of life based on moral valuesand benevolence. In order to achieve these two goals, it is necessary for young people toreceive a manners-centered education.It has always been desired for young people to be individuals who are aware oftheir servitude, are morally equiped, are free from harmful habits and are useful for thepublic. In this regard, an understanding that can guide today’s youth can be adapted frommysticism thoughts. Based on this idea, this article will first focus on the importance offutuwwa principles in Sufi books for raising compassionate, brave and benevolent youngpeople. After that, attention will be drawn to the benefit of the principle of “halvet derencümen”, in other words, “to be with God in public” in directing the youth to goodness.

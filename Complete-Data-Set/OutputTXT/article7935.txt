Makale Başlığı: VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE TURKISH VERSION OF THE NURSES’ ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY SCALE – ACUTE CARE VERSION: A METHODOLOGICAL STUDY
Özet: This is a methodological study that aims to adapt the NAQS-ACV scale to the Turkish context, as well as to test its validity and reliability. The study was conducted in 1 medical Faculty hospital, 2 public hospitals, and 1 private hospital in a city located in the southern part of Turkey between the 1st of January and 31st of March 2016. The study included 427 nurses who worked in the internal diseases, surgery, and obstetric clinics of the related hospitals. Data were collected through the “Nurse Information Form” and “Nurses’ Assessment of Quality Scale – Acute Care Version”. While the validity analysis of the NAQS-ACV included language, scope, and construct analysis, reliability analysis included internal consistency reliability analysis. The 77-item Turkish version of the NAQS-ACV was composed of 3 sections and 8 sub-scales. Sub-scale KMO values of the scale ranged between 0.775 and 0.948, and the Barlett test result was found p<0.001. CFA fit indices of the scale were in an acceptable range. Cronbach’s alpha values of the scale were found 0.814 -0.960. No items in the original scale were excluded from the scale as a result of the reliability and validity analyses of the Turkish form of the NAQS-ACV Scale. In conclusion, the Turkish form of the NAQS-ACV scale was found to be a valid and reliable measurement tool. It is recommended to conduct the test-retest analysis of the scale in different groups.

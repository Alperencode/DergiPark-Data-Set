Özet: In this study, it is examined in which context and adjectives the students of the faculty of divinity perceive morality. The main objective of the research is to reveal how the students of the faculty of divinity, who will be assigned as religious educators and religious services personnel, perceive morality. The data obtained in the research, which has a qualitative design, was interpreted based on the interpretive tradition. It was determined that the participants perceived morality on four basic dimensions. Accordingly, while value-based personality traits were determined as the most mentioned moral qualities, especially respect, justice, truthfulness and doing good came to the fore. In the context of relations with the environment and society, sensitivity to nature and not disturbing the peace of the society were mentioned more. Compliance with the rules of etiquette and the use of a proper style in communication are emphasized. Finally, in religion-based features, one's self-control, fear of Allah in his actions and observing his prohibitions came to the fore. It has been understood that most of the students perceive morality as not doing the negative behavior. In this context, it is enough for many participants not to make mistakes, and this addresses the lower stages of moral development.

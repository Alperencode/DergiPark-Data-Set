Makale Başlığı: Small And Medium Enterprises Incubators In Yemen: Reality And Challenges
Özet: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are an important pillar in the economy of any country, as they affect economic development, help reduce unemployment and poverty, and seek to improve livelihoods. However, these enterprises face some difficulties in the startup phase and during operation. These difficulties vary according to the needs of the enterprise and the way of achieving its mission. This research studies SMEs in Yemen because of the lack of many means that help them launch and develop, and face great obstacles due to the lack of business incubators that help them launch and grow, especially in light of the war and continuing conflict in the country. These projects are exposed to many risks, the least of which is the risk of closure due to the lack of support and the absence of the role of incubators, which led to the collapse and closure of some enterprises. Depending on the data collected and the available statistics for this topic, the research concluded that there are no business incubators in Yemen that cover the number of small and medium projects, which led to a low level of projects in Yemen and a low level of Yemen among countries. There is no suitable business environment for entrepreneurs from incubators and accelerators, and it is necessary to activate the role of government and private initiatives to meet the needs of SMEs and contribute to achieving their goals and ensure their continuity.

Makale Başlığı: Opinions of forest administration employees on using electronic sales in the sales of forest products
Özet: This research was carried out to determine the opinions of the implementing personnel regarding electronic sales methods, which have started being used in the sale of wood-based forest products. Within the scope of the research, a survey was conducted with 323 personnel working in various units of the General Directorate of Forestry and working in electronic sales. Basic statistical tests and the chi-square test were used in the analysis of the research data. According to the research findings, the use of electronic sales in the sales of forest products, which started in 2019 with the reflection of technological developments in forestry, has become widespread with the Covid -19 pandemic period. Electronic sales, which were approached cautiously at the beginning by practitioners, were adopted due to the curfews during the pandemic process, the risks born with doing business face-to-face, the ease, reliability, speed and fairness etc. of the method and the consideration that it was more advantageous compared to in-person sales. It is thought that the method plays a role in the increase in the sales prices of forest products along with other reasons. The most negative aspect of the method is the reduction of direct communication-interaction with customers.

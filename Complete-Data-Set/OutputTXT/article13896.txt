Makale Başlığı: READING TAYYAR AHMET’İN SONSUZ SAYILI GÜNLERİ IN THE CONTEXT OF SUBCULTURE
Özet: It is possible to say that literature and literature reviews gain a different dimension every day. Today, concepts belonging to the field of literature and especially linguistics are used to develop methods belonging to many different fields. Undoubtedly, this situation arises from the universal dimension of linguistic concepts. Especially through structural linguistics, the concepts of this field have been quoted and transformed by many disciplines. It is possible to consider the literature in this context. It is also quite clear that writing, the material of which is language, can be associated with linguistic concepts. However, the song named Tayyar Ahmet’in Sonsuz Sayılı Günleri, which is the object of this study, can also be discussed and questioned in the light of these concepts. Because a song is first and foremost a discourse. Therefore, a song can be treated as a discourse and analyzed through the concepts of intertextuality, semiotics, and linguistics. The purpose of this study is to prove that a song as a discourse can be analyzed in this context. In addition to this, it is necessary to refer to sub-culture to make sense of this song thematically. Because Tayyar Ahmet’in Sonsuz Sayılı Günleri tells the typification process of a fictional person, Tayyar Ahmet. This study is the analysis of a song as a discourse in the context of sub-culture by quoting the concepts of the above-mentioned fields.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF CONSUMER-BRAND IDENTIFICATION ON WILLINGNESS TO PAY MORE: THE ROLES OF MATERIALISM, SIMILARITY AVOIDANCE, AND IMPULSIVE BUYING
Özet: Consumer-brand identification has been considered an important concept to understand the reasons for establishing long-term brand relationships. Drawing on social identity theory, it is aimed to investigate materialism as an antecedent to and willingness to purchase as a consequence of consumer-brand identification. The moderating roles of similarity avoidance and impulsive buying are also examined. The proposed research model is tested with data from 210 Turkish consumers. Findings demonstrate that materialism increases consumer-brand identification, and this effect is stronger when consumers tend to avoid similarity. Further, consumer-brand identification results in increase in customers’ willingness to pay more. Yet, contrary to expectations, this contribution is weaker in the case of higher impulsive buying. Contributions to the theory and practice are discussed and suggestions for future studies are offered.

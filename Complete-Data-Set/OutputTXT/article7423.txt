Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the chemical composition, genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) seed oil on human blood cells
Özet: The aim of this study is to investigate the fatty acid composition and mineral matter of crude oil from cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) seeds, which was grown under cultural conditions. In this study, the oil was obtained from cold press, and different doses of oils were determined to malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in human erythrocytes.Methods and Results: Its effects on mitotic index (MI), micronucleus (MN) and replication index (RI) parameters in human peripheral lymphocyte cultures were examined. According to the results, seeds of cocklebur averaged 30% oil content. The highest fatty acid composition was linoleic acid at 72.624%. The genotoxicity results showed a genotoxic effect to the dose-dependent (0.16, 0.32, and 0.50 µL mL-1). Cocklebur seed oil caused significant decreases in MI and RI values (0.16, 0.32, and 0.50 µL mL-1). Afterwards, MDA level increase, SOD, CAT, GST, GPx and AChE activities of human blood cells significantly decreased in increasing doses of oil compared with not-treated cells, especially from the 0.08 µL mL-1.Conclusions: Consequently, cytotoxic genotoxic effects are detected in high concentrations, cocklebur oil can be evaluated at lower doses. Antioxidant results also support this opinion.

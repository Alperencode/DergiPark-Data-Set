Makale Başlığı: Action research on interdisciplinary teaching of financial literacy in elementary schools
Özet: Although there has been a recent surge of interest in financial literacy some inadequacies based on interdisciplinary approach in teachers' instructional practices within the scope of financial education draw attention. This research focused on improving the teaching process of elementary school teachers by integrating financial literacy into an interdisciplinary approach to social studies teaching. Research was conducted in three elementary schools with low socioeconomic status in three different cities in Türkiye. The data obtained from reflection forms, student products, and semi-structured interview forms were analyzed using MAXQDA 2020 program. As a result of examining views on the instructional practices implemented, participants indicated that they contributed to developing various instructional competencies, such as the acquisition of interdisciplinary skills, the effective use of information technologies, observing the effects of interdisciplinary, and preparing original materials and activities. In addition, participants indicated that the activities implemented provided students with opportunities to learn new financial concepts, new skills, sustained and meaningful learning, active participation, transfer to real life, positive feedback from parents, learning, and reinforcement with fun.

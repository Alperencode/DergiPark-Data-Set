Makale Başlığı: THE DEVLET NEWSPAPER AS A NATIONALIST POLITICAL PUBLICATION: DISCUSSIONS AND ACTORS (1969-1978)
Özet: Publishing activities had been at the forefront since the first years of the Republic and although the transfer of theories in different fields to the society was mostly ensured on this occasion, it continued its effectiveness as a political propaganda tool. As a matter of fact, the Devlet Newspaper, which will be examined in this study, was active between 1969 and 1978 as a publication organ supporting the nationalist view and had an important function. The period in which the newspaper was published is considered important in that it covers a period in which important events took place in Turkish political life, as well as a period in which political disagreements and ideological polarization were at their peak. In this direction, the answers given to questions such as the point of view of the events and phenomena in Turkish politics, the presentation of the defended ideas and the themes highlighted from the nationalist point of view, in the Devlet newspaper, are very valuable in terms of showing the understanding of Turkish nationalism, intellectual infrastructure and politics of the period. In our study, the 435 issues of the newspaper, published between April 7, 1969, and March 6, 1978, will be examined and evaluated with general terms in this context.

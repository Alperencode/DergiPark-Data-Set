Makale Başlığı: A comparative assessment of antifungal activity of essential oils of five medicinal plants from Tunisia
Özet: The leaf essential oil yields of clementine, cypress, rosemary, tea, and thyme were 0.22, 0.87, 1.46, 1.20, and 0.72%, respectively, based on the dry weight of the plant material. The leaf essential oils of rosemary, tea, and thyme contained the highest levels of oxygenated monoterpenes (60.14-91.70%). Rosemary and tea leaf essential oils were rich in 1,8-cineole (49.98% and 57.55%, respectively), and they have potent antifungal activity against Alternaria alternata strain (MIC = 5000 μg/ml). Thyme was rich in carvacrol (78.54%) and had a MIC of 6000 μg/ml against A. alternata strain. Clementine leaf essential oil was characterized by the predominance of monoterpene hydrocarbons (88.65%), and it possessed a weak antifungal activity against A. alternata (MIC = 8000 μg/ml). Cypress leaf essential oil was characterized by the predominance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (60.67%), having an antifungal activity of 8000 μg/ml.

Makale Başlığı: Gathering Facts and Evidence in The Trials Regarding the Temporary Measures That Can Be Taken in the Divorce Case
Özet: According to Article 169 of the Turkish Civil Code, during the divorce case, the judge ex officio takes the necessary temporary measures regarding the accommodation of the spouses, their livelihood, the management of the spouses' property and the care and protection of the children. These temporary measures are in the nature of temporary legal protection. In cases where the principle of party presentation in the main trial is valid, as a rule, the principle of party presentation applies in the trials regarding temporary legal protection too. Against this, in cases where the principle of ex officio investigation the main trial is valid, the principle of ex officio investigation applies in the trials regarding temporary legal protection too. In Turkish law, the principle of party presentation is applied in the divorce case. However, this does not mean that the principle party presentation will be applied in the proceedings too regarding the temporary measures that can be taken during the divorce case. Namely, in the trials regarding temporary measures, the principle of ex officio investigation is valid as per Article 169 of the Turkish Civil Code. The principle of ex officio investigation is complementary to the principle of ex officio proceedings. Therefore, the principle of ex officio investigation is applied in the trials regarding the temporary measures that can be taken during the divorce case.

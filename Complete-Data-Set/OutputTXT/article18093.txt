Makale Başlığı: The Significance of Novel Hematologic Inflammatory Parameters in Predicting Aortic Valve Sclerosis
Özet: Aim: Inflammatory process plays a critical role in the progression of aortic valve sclerosis (AVS). This study aims to evaluate the haematological and biochemical inflammatory markers in AVS patients.Methods: A retrospective observational study was included consecutive 557 patients who underwent an echocardiogram between June 2021 and September 2021. The study population was divided into two groups according to the presence of AVS. The groups were compared in terms of C-reactive protein (CRP), Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte-HDL cholesterol ratio (MHR).Results: The mean age was 63 ± 10 years. C-reactive protein (CRP), NLR, PLR and MHR were significantly higher in patients with AVS. The best cut-off values of the NLR were 1.4 (a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 74%), PLR was 116 (a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 54%), and MHR was 9.5 (a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 75%). CRP (OR: 1.246, 95% CI: 1.117 – 1.389; p < 0.001), NLR (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.456 – 3.032; p < 0.001), and MHR (OR: 1.227, 95% CI: 1.125 – 1.339; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of the AVS when NLR and MHR analysed as a continuous variable. Using a cut off level of NLR > 1.4 (OR: 4.825, 95% CI: 2.430 – 9.583; p < 0.001) and MHR > 9.5 (OR: 13.937, 95% CI: 7.464 – 26.023; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of the AVS.Conclusion: Increased CRP levels, NLR and MHR were found to be independent predictors for AVS. Hematological inflammatory biomarkers are cost effective and helpful approach for prediction of AVS presence.

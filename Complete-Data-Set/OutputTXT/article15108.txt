Makale Başlığı: Effects of polymer and humic acid applications on the structural development of soil
Özet: Due to the agricultural methods used today, soils lose their production capacity and are exposed to significant degradation. A well-developed structure and a soil structure with high aggregate stability are very important in terms of increasing productivity and reducing erodibility. This study was carried out in three replications according to the full chance block design in greenhouse conditions in order to determine the effects of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylamide (PAM) and humic acid (HA) applications on the structural development of the soil. Surface soil samples with three different textures (clay, loam and sandy loam) were used in the study. In the greenhouse, PVA, PAM and HA were applied at doses of 500, 100 and 500 ppm, respectively, to the soil samples transferred to 1 kg pots and incubated in four different periods (0, 15, 30 and 45 days). Irrigation was done when 50% of the available moisture in the soil was depleted during incubation. After the completion of the incubation, analyzes and evaluations were made on the structural parameters of the soils. The obtained results show that application of PVA, PAM and HA to clay, loamy and sandy loam soils increased (on average) the water-stable aggregate values by 5.38%, 6.34% and 12.91%, respectively. It shows that the dispersion ratio values decreased (on average) by 46.56%, 8.11%, and 12. 91%, respectively. Period 1 (24.52) in increasing the aggregate stability and period 2 (29.92) in decreasing the dispersion ratio value were determined as the most effective periods. It has been determined that the efficiency decreases as the period gets longer. It was determined that PVA was the most effective regulator in all three soil groups.

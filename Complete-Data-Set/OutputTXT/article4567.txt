Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Transformational Leadership of Principals and Subjective Well-Being of Teachers: A Correlational Study
Özet: The study aims to determine the relationship between transformational leadership of school principals and subjective well-being of teachers. 517 teachers working in public secondary schools in the central districts of Ankara province participated in this study which was carried out with the quantitative correlational research method. Stratified sampling technique was used in the selection of the participants. “Transformational Leadership Scale” and “Teacher Subjective Well-Being Scale” were used and descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were utilized in the analysis of the collected data. The results show that teachers' perceptions of transformational leadership are high, but their perceptions of subjective well-being are low. The results of the study show that transformational leadership is a significant predictor of teachers’ subjective well-being and there is a positive and low level relationship between them. The findings that are expected to contribute to the literature were discussed and some suggestions were made for both researchers and practitioners based on these. It has been suggested that activities aimed at increasing the subjective well-being of teachers and contributing to their professional development in schools should be included in the general curriculum of the school, and various inclusion activities should be organized in and out of school for mutual expectations and needs between teachers and school administrators.

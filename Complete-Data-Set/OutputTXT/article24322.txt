Makale Başlığı: Climate Change: Global, Regional and Urban Effects
Özet: The first findings about climate change in the history have started about 300 years ago. The greenhouse effect and the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have begun to be explored in the scientific world since the 17th century. Until 1970, these studies were carried on the global scale with doubts on climate change, but during the 1st World Climate Conference, the advanced cognition with scientists of climate reduced the doubts. It is widely accepted that urbanization and climate change have a reciprocal relationship. It has been determined that regional and urban areas will be affected mostly by the global impacts of climate change, and regional and urban areas have an effect to accelerate climate change. Although the cities cover less than 2 percent of the Earth's surface, they consume 78 percent of the world's energy and produce more than 60 percent of all carbon dioxide. At the same time, regional and urban areas are highly vulnerable to climate change. For this reason, adaptation and mitigation studies are being carried out to reduce the impacts of climate change on regional and urban areas and their vulnerability to climate change

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Nutritional Consumption Frequency of and Investigation of the Effect of Nutritional Knowledge Levels on Body Mass Index on University Students: A Sample of Istanbul Aydin University
Özet: Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the frequency of food consumption of university students and to examine the effect of nutritionalknowledge levels on Body Mass Index (BMI).Material and Methods: A questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional habits, general nutrition informationquestionnaire (GBBA) and food consumption frequency was applied to 812 students studying at Istanbul Aydın University. Data wereanalyzed with SPSS v26.Results: The average age of the student is 20.87±1.27 years, 68.4% of the students are female and 31.6% are male. The mean BMI of thestudents was 22.82±2.91 kg/m2, 8.7% were underweight in terms of BMI, 65.3% were normal weight, 22.8% were obese and 3.2% wereobese. GBBA point average of students; It is 253.92±25.64, and the median score of male students [131 (101-167)] in GBBA's “NutritionSources” sub-factor score is statistically higher than female students [128 (95-174)] (U= 63410; p<0.05). In the "Choosing Daily Foods" sub-factor score of GBBA, the median score of normal-weight students [30 (19-36)] is statistically higher than thin students [28 (18-36)](H=8.058; p<0.05). The GBBA values of the students do not significantly affect the BMI values (p>0.05), and the total GBI score of theobese students is the lowest at 260 (206-287). The students most frequently used fresh salad once a day with 54.1%, and the least; Theyconsume milk dessert/ice cream with 19.2%.Conclusion: Nutrition knowledge level of students does not affect BMI values.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Mortality Effect and Acute Toxicity of Two Disazo Dyes on Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae)
Özet: This study was carried out to evaluate mortality effect and acute toxicity of two 5-(3'-amino-4'-arylazo-1H-pyrazole-5'-ylazo) barbituric acid dyes (Dye 1 and Dye 2) on Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae) known as model organism in ecotoxicological studies. After detailed mortality assessments, it was concluded that Dye 2 had the potential to cause a greater mortality effect on organisms compared to Dye 1 and that its long-term existence in aquatic ecosystems at high concentrations could pose a significant threat to these ecosystems. In the performed toxicity classification, it was found that Dye 1 was practically non-toxic at 24- and 48-hour exposures but slightly toxic at 72- and 96-hour exposures, while Dye 2 was practically non-toxic at 24-hour exposure but slightly toxic at 48-, 72- and 96-hour exposures. It can be suggested that these differences in mortality effect and toxicity may be due to the different substituents in the dye structure. The present study provides valuable information regarding mortality effect and acute toxicity of azo dyes containing methoxy and methyl groups in their structure (Dye 1 and Dye 2, respectively) on C. riparius. However, to be able to make more comprehensive ecotoxicological evaluations, it is a fact that there is a necessity for further studies in which the effects and action mechanisms of these and suchlike azo dyes and their degradation products on different organisms will be investigated at the molecular level and their actual concentrations in aquatic environments will be determined.

Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of Imprecise Outputs of Space Syntax Applied Urban Studies
Özet: Space syntax is a quantitative model utilized to examine spatial configurations in settlements. In space syntax analysis, only bird’s eye drawings are utilized and settlements are treated as 2D-formations made of settlement plans only as the inputs, building heights and altitude differences, variations in pedestrian profiles, and characteristics of historic built environments, are neglected. The major problem handled in this paper is that space syntax analysis grants approximately identical results for multiple different settlements sharing similar settlement plan layouts and it makes space syntax outputs imprecise. The main research question in this study is: Do current space syntax applied urban studies involve additional approaches to refine imprecisions of outputs of space syntax analysis alone? If yes, what strategies have been implemented? The procedure consists of the following: introducing space syntax and imprecisions of its outputs, categorization and nomenclature of neglected inputs, strategies to overcome the imprecisions, and classification, analysis and assessment of case studies in terms of the neglected inputs to overcome the imprecisions. With the expectation of observation of diverse strategies, case studies have been chosen in accordance with three criteria: focusing on different urban issues, dealing with different locations, and hosting historic built environments with different status and layout. At the end, it has been deduced that most case studies still rely on space syntax application alone and the imprecisions persist as a result.

Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION of ACTIVITIES ENZYME PROLIDASE (PRO) and GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GST) in POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) PATIENTS
Özet: This study investigated serum antioxidant enzyme activity (Glutathione-S-transferase) and Prolidase in patients with PCOS.A total of 42 patients with PCOS and 43 healthy control subjects were enrolled. Serum Prolidase and Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were measured spectrophotometrically.Age, TSH, fT4, Prolactin, Estradiol, FSH, systolic and diastolic blood pressure parameters were not statistically significant between PCOS group and healthy control group. BMI, weight, height, waist-hip ratio, menstrual cycle, FGS, FPG, LH, Insulin, androstenedione, SHBG, total testosterone parameters were statistically significantly increased in the PCOS group compared to the healthy control group. The serum glutathione-S-transferase was significantly decreased ( p < 0.05) in patients with PCOS, compared with control subjects. Prolidase (Pro) activity has been found to be significantly higher in women with PCOS than in the control group.Antioxidant enzyme GST activity has found to be decreased in PCOS patient group. Prolidase (Pro) enzyme is a candidate to be a leading parameter in the elucidation of the disease. In conclusion, the activities of glutathione-S-transferase and Prolidase (Pro) enzymes may be precursors in the etiopathogenesis of PCOS. This study has done in the literature for the first time. In addition, more work should be done in this area.

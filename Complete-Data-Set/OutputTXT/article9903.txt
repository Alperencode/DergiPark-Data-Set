Makale Başlığı: The Troubles of Dividing Arabic into Traditional and Modern Parts (Classical and Modern)
Özet: In this article, I agree about the separation of Arabic into two parts, traditional and modern, and the research on the problems this separation poses in Arabic education for non-Arabs.Non-Arab students are encouraged in this regard by being directed to classical Arabic; modern Arabic is neglected, confined to limited daily dialogue. This study aims to correct the said understanding of taksim made about Arabic and to prove that modern Arabic is only a part of the classical.The vast majority of modern Arabic is based on original words and compositions. It has roots in history and literature. Despite the passage of centuries, the Qur'an has preserved the vehicle. In addition to the Qur'an, works in the field of language and tafsir have also preserved this language. It can be used in communication, children's programs, politics, economics, etc. This language set an example in all areas of society.The language of the Qur'an still maintains its vitality and is used in daily life. As a matter of fact, people derive new words on the loom of the language used by the Qur'an in order to catch up with the cultural and civil development.Keywords:Language, modern, separation.

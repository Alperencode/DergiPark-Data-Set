Makale Başlığı: Functions of -(y)A Suffix in Old Anadolian Turkish within the Framework of Functional and Dependency Grammar Theories: The Example of Divan of Yunus Emre
Özet: There are various units in the language which are responsible for ensuring that expressions such as intention, desire, possibility, adequacy and necessity reach the receiver. One of these units in the language is -(y)A suffix. It has been observed that -(y)A suffix, whose main function is to express request in Old Anatolian Turkish texts, is used to meet different meaning areas such as necessity, adequacy, condition, time, purpose, and situation. Accordingly, this study was designated to determine the functions of -(y)A suffix in Divan of Yunus Emre. In the study, functions of the suffix are discussed under two separate titles as being the executive of main clause and the executive of subordinate clause, based on the principles of functional grammar theory suggesting that “each unit in a language can have more than one function” and of dependency grammar theory suggesting that “the verb directs the sentence”.

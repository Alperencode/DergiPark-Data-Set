Özet: AbstractThis study aims to determine the effect of the Jigsaw technique used in cooperative learning on the learning of family planning methods by nursing students and the students' views on the technique. Pre-test – post-test is a study in a quasi-experimental design. The sample consisted of 68 students from the third year of the nursing department. The students were divided into expert groups following the Jigsaw technique and conducted peer studies. Research data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Family Planning Methods Questionnaire and the Jigsaw Opinion Scale, and an online survey platform in the classroom environment. The data were analyzed with the SPSS 26.0 program. 68.6% of the students were girls, the mean age of the participants was 20.63±0.82, and 82.9% of them had not received training on family planning methods before. The Family Planning Methods Questionnaire post-test mean score (95.47±5.73) was significantly higher than the pre-test mean score (61.23± 14.46) (t=137,234; p<0.001). Jigsaw Vision Scale’s total score average is 64.50±7.50. 80% of the students stated that this technique was used in terms of 'establishing a democratic and friendly relationship with the teacher', 75.7% 'frequency and quality of communication with groupmates and class' and 75.7% 'providing preparation for the lesson'. indicated that it was effective. It was concluded that the Jigsaw technique is more effective than the traditional method in learning family planning methods. It can be suggested that this technique be used as a cooperative learning method in nursing education.

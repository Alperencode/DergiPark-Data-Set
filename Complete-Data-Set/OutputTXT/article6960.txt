Makale Başlığı: Approach to Acute Phase Reactions in the Aspects of Pathology and General Situation in Turkey
Özet: This review evaluates the importance of acute phase proteins (APP) and acute phase reaction (APR), which are accepted as sensitive biomarkers in diagnosing of animal diseases, both in general and pathological terms, with a particular emphasis on the situation in Turkey. Pathological examinations have been extensively used in studies investigating the APP and APR in veterinary medicine globally. In contrast, the number of studies and pathology involvement is limited in Turkey. For this reason, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the studies in the world and in Turkey to emphasize the importance of the subject and increase awareness among the clinicians. The review is the first comprehensive report on the subject in Turkey and is supported by a regional map of the distribution of performed studies.

Makale Başlığı: THE CHILDREN’S LIMYRA: A PROJECT FOR PROTECTING THE FUTURE OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
Özet: The ancient town of Limyra is located in the village of Saklısu in the province of Antalya. With its ruins and natural landscape it represents cultural and natural treasure that must be preserved. The inhabitants of the Saklısu village, which is directly located on the ruins, use the land extensively for greenhouse agriculture. Having never experienced any attempt to bring  them closer to these cultural and natural values of their village they always live in fear of  being expropriated and their children grow up with the prejudices built by their families. The “Children’s Limyra” summer school was launched by the excavation team in order to reach out to children at an early age to preempt prejudices building up. The objective was to sensitize the children to their historical and natural environment; like a friend with whom they share daily life. Students from undergraduate and graduate education of ITU architecture developed and implemented workshops between 2011and 2016 over a period of 8 days. Every year 40-50 children of Saklısu aged between 5-14 joined these summer schools. The program was ended as excavation activities were halted due to non-archaeological reasons.

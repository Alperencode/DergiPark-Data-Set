Makale Başlığı: A CASE STUDY ON SPECIALIZATION MODELS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHING
Özet: The aim of the present study is to evaluate specialization models in primary school teaching based on the opinions of teachers and academicians studying teacher education. The research is considered to be important in that it is one of the first studies in the national literature on the related issue and it reveals advantages and disadvantages of each model. Multiple case-holistic design, one of the qualitative research methods, was followed in the study since it focuses on data obtained from primary school teachers working in private schools that adopt different specialization methods as well as academicians specializing in the field of teacher education. In order to receive opinions from participants, two different data collection tools were used, which were the Private School Teacher Interview Form and the Academician Interview Form. 33 participants were interviewed using the determined data collection tools in the 2018-2019 academic year. A content analysis method was used in the analysis of the obtained qualitative data. According to the results of the study, advantages and disadvantages of each model were identified. It was recommended as a result of the study that it might be effective to use departmentalized classroom models and looping models simultaneously in order for the students to establish positive relationships with teachers and for teachers to develop professional knowledge and skills.

Makale Başlığı: LYRICAL AND MUSICAL ANALYSIS OF TURKISH AND JAPANESE LULLABIES
Özet: Lullabies sung to calm children are cultural values that contain important clues about the society and the people who sing them. In this descriptive study, lyrical analysis was conducted between 50 Turkish lullabies and 50 Japanese lullabies. Features such as colour, number, and motifs in lullabies have been examined comparatively. In addition, the topics mentioned in lullabies (love, longing, etc.) have been emphasized. In the continuation of the study, analyses have been made between 5 Turkish lullabies and 5 Japanese lullabies in terms of tessitura, distribution of sounds used, rhythmic and melodic structure.As a result of the study, due to the general structure of lullabies, verbal and musical simplicity emerged as a common feature of Turkish and Japanese lullabies. However, social differences have been determined in terms of the motifs, clothes and the ways of addressing. The great difference in the names of fruits, flowers and animals in the lullabies clearly revealed the geographical features. Significant differences were also determined in terms of the mental state of the people who sing the lullaby and the issues they talked about.

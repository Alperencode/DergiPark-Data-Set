Makale Başlığı: Suicide with Cyanide and Psychological Autopsy of A Hospital Employee: Case Report
Özet: AbstractCyanide is one of the fastest effective known toxic substances. Suicide attempt is an attitude of preferring death between life and death. Psychological autopsy is applied to clarify why individuals tend to suicide, to understand their motivations, and to evaluate their deaths. In this study, a 52-year-old male case who was found dead in the hospital archive room is presented. Cyanide was found in the toxicological examination of the fluid taken from the scene. In autopsy, diffuse foamy edema fluid in the trachea and main bronchi, congestion and edema in the lungs, severe bleeding and erosive appearance were observed in the gastric mucosa, and in toxicological examination cyanide was detected in the blood and stomach contents. During the psychological autopsy, it was learned that the case attempted suicide with a gunshot in the past due to financial difficulties, that he was not well-to-do with his father and siblings and that they did not meet because they could not agree on financial issues, that the case got money from many people from his family and his wife’s family, and finally, his siblings received the card that belong to their mother from the case. As a result; while making a diagnosis of cyanide intoxication, crime scene investigation findings, autopsy findings and toxicological data should be evaluated together. In addition, the psychology of individuals who are thought to have committed suicide should also be evaluated and their psychological autopsies should be performed.

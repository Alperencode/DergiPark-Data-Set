Makale Başlığı: BABURID (MUGHAL) CONTROL ON THE KHYBER PASS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
Özet: The Khyber Pass played a key role throughout history for the transit of Turkestan and India. This pass mostly remained under the control of the rulers of Kabulistan and the local tribes in the historical course; and attempts made from the Indian side to gain controlmet with great difficulties. The pass had spent the whole sixteenth century under Baburid(Mughal) rule, albeit it appears that it had become an area of conflict between the central government and the autonomous administration on the other side of it. Despite them havinggreat armies and rich treasures and achieving spectacular success in India, the Baburidemperors had to constantly struggle with other members of the dynasty and their supporters located in Kabul. In these power struggles, Khyber became the main natural barrier separating the two factions. The struggle for dominance over the pass from Babur Shah to the reign of Akbar Shah is also a harbinger of developments such as the Anglo-Afghan Wars that took place in the following centuries. In this study, the struggles for domination on the route in question, the measures taken by the rulers of India against the attacks that could come through it, and the commercial role of the road in the said period are discussed and an assessment is presented in this context.

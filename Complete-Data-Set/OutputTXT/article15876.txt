Makale Başlığı: The Most Important Health Problem of the 21st Century: Investigation of Obesity in Women According to Their Life Periods
Özet: Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat and an important public health problem affecting all ages in both men and women. It has been shown that obesity is responsible for many genetic, environmental, neurological, physiological, biochemical, cultural and spiritual factors. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Body Mass Index (BMI) for obesity classification due to its simplicity, cost-effectivity, and high accuracy. Apart from BMI, waist circumference measurement, weight-to-height, skinfold thickness, and circumference measurements are also used. According to the WHO, 2.8 million people die every year due to obesity. Although obesity affects all ages and social groups, women have been more overweight compared to men since and has been linked to many biological factors. However, even with the medical problems, obese women live longer than men, but not without higher healthcare costs. In this review, the effects of obesity on women's health and life will be discussed.

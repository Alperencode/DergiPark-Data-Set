Makale Başlığı: KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIORS RELATED TO COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PRACTICES IN PHYSIOTHERAPY AND REHABILITATION STUDENTS
Özet: Purpose: There are studies in the literature evaluating students’ attitudes toward and knowledge of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices, with most of this research focusing on medical, pharmacy, nursing and psychology students; however, few studies have been conducted with physiotherapy and rehabilitation (PTR) students. The aim of this study was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to CAM among students of PTR.Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2018 to March 2019. A self-administered questionnaire form developed to identify the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding CAM practices among students of PTR. The questionnaire form included eighteen items that was sent via email to the participants.  Results: A total of 504 participants were included in this study. Their mean age was 21.66±2.50 years, 69.84% was female and 30.16% was male. Most participants (76.99%) thought that various CAM practices could be beneficial adjuncts to modern medicine. The most used sources of CAM practices was reported as online resources (64.68%). Moreover, the most well-known CAM practice among the students was massage (82.90%).Conclusions and Suggestions: Majority of PTR students had a positive opinion about CAM practices. Incorporating evidence-based CAM practices with high levels of efficacy into the curricula can reliably increase physiotherapists’ knowledge about CAM practices.

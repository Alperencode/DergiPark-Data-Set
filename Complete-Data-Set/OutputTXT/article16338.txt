Makale Başlığı: Attitudes and Behaviors of Consumers About the Recycling of Household Packaging Wastes: The Case of Samsun Province, Türkiye
Özet: The aim of this research is to reveal the attitudes and behaviors of consumers regarding household packaging waste recycling in the urban area of Samsun-Türkiye. The Survey data consists of 384 questionnaires conducted with consumers. According to the results, 60.2% of consumers believe that there has been no social awareness about recycling yet. In addition, the majority of consumers (87%) agreed that individual awareness about recycling constitutes the first step towards achieving awareness on the social level. The most obvious consumer attitude identified in the research is that more effort should be made to recycling (4.33). Important consumer behaviors about recycling are; not buying packaged products that pollute the environment (3.88), warning family and friends about recycling (3.81), and reacting to the environmentally damaging behaviors of unknown people (3.74). The main objective in raising the awareness of consumers about recycling should be to recycle household packaging waste in a short time at a low cost. However, to prevent the harm of waste to human health and the environment, manufacturers and authorized institutions have important duties along with consumers. A significant amount of added value in terms of the economy will be increased through creating awareness at the social level about the recycling of household packaging waste, minimizing the damage to humans and the environment, and preventing resource waste.

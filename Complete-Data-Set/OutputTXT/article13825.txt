Makale Başlığı: From Ali Şir Nevâyî’s Sedd-i İskenderî Forth Thoughts On The Requirement Of Re Writing Classical Texts
Özet: This study basically seeks answers for questions such as “How can the classical figures and works of Turkish history be introduced to today’s people? Who, which work(s) and which elements, motifs or narratives in the work(s) can be used for this? What methods can be used in this process?” Although we think that all historical texts should be rewritten in the long run, we believe that classical figures and works that have the potential to carry culture should be prioritized. In this process, after the source texts are determined, the main point is that these texts are transformed into a form that today’s people can enjoy. We think that the possibilities of “re-writing”, which is one of the modern text criticism methods, can be used for such a transformation. In this study, Alî Şîr Nevâyî and his work named Sedd-i İskenderî were chosen as an example of the person/work that we think should be re-written because of their characteristics. At the beginning of the study, brief information about the re-writing method will be given and why the classical texts should be re-written will be discussed. Afterwards, it will be evaluated why we suggested Alî Şîr Nevâyî and his Sedd-i İskenderî for re-writing. Then it will be questioned what kind of organization can be used to carry out a re-writing process that we mean. Finally, examples of elements that we think should be highlighted in a “possible” re-writing of the Sedd-i İskenderî will be given.

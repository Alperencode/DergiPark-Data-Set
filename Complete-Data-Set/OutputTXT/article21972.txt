Makale Başlığı: THE BASIC APPROACHES TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF PLACE AND MUSIC: THE PHENOMENON IN THE ETNOGRAPHIC RESEARCHES
Özet: In this study, which is placed in the framework of the ethnographic field, experience and music, the basic approaches are revealed by making use of the methodological and theoretical knowledge of ethnomusicology, anthropology and social sciences. The decisiveness of the meanings attributed to the ethnographic field on the cultural analysis has been presented with an interdisciplinary approach, and the differentiating and changing scientific perspectives in the historical process have been emphasized. The geographical and physical characteristics of the ethnographic field, its institutionalism, multidimensionality or homogeneity, in short, its authenticity, which is related to the intended subject, are indicated with its methodological and theoretical dimensions. During the course of the study, many sources based on the theoretical and methodological ethnographic researches are scanned and the data obtained are interpreted with a descriptive character.

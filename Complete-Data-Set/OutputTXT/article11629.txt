Makale Başlığı: INQUIRIES CONCERNING ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY AND ITS NOTIONS FROM THE MIDDLE AGES TO THE PRESENT DAY
Özet: The Middle Ages is the period when world of thought was formed as well as physical structures of modern world such as institutions. In the Middle Ages when foundations of present forms of Judaism, Christianity and Islam were laid, also the philosophical systems dependent on these religions were formed. This formation has brought along debates which have not been concluded mosty for rather a long time as well. Although the religions and their practices are different, it is possible to reduce the source of the aformentioned debates to a single question: Should this philosophy (Jewish, Christian or Islamic) be defined as an act of members of this religion (Jewish, Christian or Islamic) or does this philosophy (Jewish, Christian or Islamic) take its source from this religion (Jewish, Christian or Islamic)? In short, should the identity of these religious philosophical systems be labeled according to their actors or their subjects? This single question brings along the inquiry on the most important and basic relationship, as well: Religion and Philosophy.Discussing the religion and philosophy relationship on Islamic Philosophy, this study is constructed upon inquires related to Islamic Philosophy about the subjects of revelation, absolute reality, indescribability of God or apophatic theology and interpretations of religious texts as common concepts of allegedly the three greatest monotheistic religions.

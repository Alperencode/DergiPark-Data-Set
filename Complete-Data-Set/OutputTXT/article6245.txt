Makale Başlığı: Social Security Rights and Social Protection Policies of Migrant Workers in the Light of International Standards
Özet: ABSTRACTMigration is a phenomenon encountered in almost every period of human history. However, today it has become a global problem. In addition to economic reasons, it is seen that the number of people who migrate due to reasons such as war and disasters is increasing. Immigrants face various risks during and after the migration process. In some countries, migrant workers are perceived as cheap labor and are generally preferred in the informal sector. This causes migrant workers, who are already vulnerable, to be socially unprotected and in an insecure environment. With Covid-19, the fact that immigrants are at a higher risk of losing their jobs and social protection inadequacies forced them to live in more difficult conditions. This study aims to emphasize the importance of social protection and social security problems of immigrants, who are more vulnerable and vulnerable in socio-economic terms, and to offer suggestions for this. For this purpose, relevant international standards and country practices were among the topics discussed.

Makale Başlığı: Sport events and Covid-19: Trail runners’ attitudes and intentions during the pandemic
Özet: COVID-19 has affected sport events, marathons, and trail-running events. Thus, it has become essential to understand the attitudes and intentions of runners, regarding their participation in the races. Therefore, this study aims to examine the changes in runners’ attitudes relating to their decision whether to participate in races, and changes in their habits because of the pandemic. Employing a qualitative research design, data were collected from 12 interviewees in Ephesus Ultra Marathon Trail Race, and by using participatory observation method. The results revealed that the participants’ motivations for participating in race events during the pandemic were socialization, healthy living, realizing their goals, and maintaining friendships. Despite the risks, the participants did not hesitate to participate in events for their belief in athlete immunity, confidence in individual precautions, their respect for the rules and the absence of fear. However, the decrease in the number of activities was found to create dissatisfaction, as it limited socialization.

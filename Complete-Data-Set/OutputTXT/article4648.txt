Makale Başlığı: Changes in Ecosystem Service Value in response to Habitat Change in the Gediz Delta Conservation Area
Özet: Coastal river deltas are very important morphological units, as they are valuable wetland ecosystems and characteristically form fertile agricultural lands. Delta wetland habitats support human existence by retaining sediment, preserving biodiversity, offering recreational opportunities, and constructing habitat and shelter, among other vital physical ecosystem services. However, delta wetlands are among the ecosystems that have been most negatively impacted by human activity, changes in coastal areas, and pollutants from urban and agricultural activities. In this study, it is aimed to determine the spatio-temporal changes of different ecosystems in the Gediz Delta Conservation Area and to determine the change in the economic value of ecosystem services. Analyses were performed using multi-spectral remotely sensed data from the Landsat TM 1987, Landsat ETM+ 2003 and Landsat OLI 2021 satellites Following the identification of habitat classes and the revelation of habitat change, the benefit transfer approach was used to calculate the temporal change in ecosystem service values (ESV). In general, reed swamp habitats decreased in area whereas shallow water surface ecosystems increased in the study area.  The yearly total value of ecosystem services between 1987 and 2021 has decreased as a result of the disappearance of reed swamp habitats.  In conclusion, the decline in ecosystem service values should be taken into account in decisions regarding the restoration and sustainability of wetlands in the study area.

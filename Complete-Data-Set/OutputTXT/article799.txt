Makale Başlığı: INDUSTRY 4.0 AND EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS
Özet: In this study, the subject of technological development and the current Industry 4.0: Smart Production-Digital Economy (I4.0) period are analyzed within the scope of evolutionary economics approach. The purpose of the analysis is to show where I4.0, as a phenomenon in change, stands in the overall functioning of capitalism. In this direction, the study consists of two parts. In the first part, the approach of evolutionary economics to the phenomenon of technology is discussed in comparison with neo-classical and Marxist economics. Secondly, it is discussed whether it would be more appropriate to consider each transition between the four industrial periods from the Industrial Revolution to the present, as a revolution or an evolutionary process. According to the results obtained, when E4.0 is considered both as a technical phenomenon and in terms of its relationship with growth and capital accumulation, it has been revealed that it progresses in an evolutionary process, just like the previous industrial periods.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Antimethanogenic Effect of Addition of Waste Coffee Extract to Alfalfa Hay (Medicago sativa) by In Vitro Gas Production Method
Özet: In this study, the addition of waste coffee extract at different doses to alfalfa hay (Medicago S.) harvested during flowering; fermentation parameters of alfalfa hay; The effects on pH values, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) production amounts, metabolizable energy and in vitro organic matter digestion were determined. The addition of waste coffee extract significantly affected the in vitro gas productions and methane production values of alfalfa hay (P<0.001). The 24-hour gas production amounts determined by the in vitro gas production method were found to be between 44.76 and 62.52 ml 200mg-1 dry matter (DM). Gas production values of alfalfa hay increased significantly with the addition of waste coffee extract, and the highest value was found in the group with 1.2 ml addition. While the lowest value in % CH4 production after fermentation was found in the control group with 16.98%; The highest production was found in the group that added 1.8 ml of waste coffee extract to alfalfa hay with 24.31%. Production amounts of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) with the addition of waste coffee extract varied between 19.27 and 23.77 mg 100ml-1, and the lowest value was found in the control group and the highest value in the group with 1.2 ml added. It was observed that the addition of waste coffee extract decreased the NH3-N production amounts of alfalfa hay (P<0.05). It significantly affected the levels of metabolizable energy and in vitro organic matter digestion (P<0.001). No difference was observed in the pH values of the rumen fluids after fermentation compared to the control group (P>0.05). As a result, it was observed that the addition of waste coffee extract to alfalfa hay does not have an antimethanogenic effect in ruminant animals.

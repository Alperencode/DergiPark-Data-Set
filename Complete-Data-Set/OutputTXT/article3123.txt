Makale Başlığı: Configural Frequency Analysis for Medical Sciences with SPSS
Özet: The aim of this study was to analyze the Configural Frequency Analysis (CFA) with the help of the CFA module prepared for SPSS and to interpret the results. The data set used in this study was taken from Von EYE and Nesselroade (1992). This dataset included 698 patients with four different behavioral disorders (L = logorrhea that is, uncontrolled, uninterrupted speaking, R = running away from home, F = fear of dark, and B = bedwetting), two different (1 = present, 2 = absent) status. The multiway contingency form is 2x2x2x2 and includes 16 configurations in total. The CFA module for SPSS uses the first degree independence model. It uses Z test and Asymptotic Binomial test to determine Type and Antitype configurations. Holm’s method was used for control Family wise error rate. The Pearson Chi-square test was found significantly under assumption of total independence of all four variables (P<0.01) Subsequently, CFA analysis was performed. As a result, CFA analysis, Types 4 and antitypes 3 of the 16 configurations were significantly found. The rest of that were non-significance. It has been shown that the CFA method can be done with the help of the SPSS program thanks to the CFA module prepared for SPSS, without the need to learn any programming language. This study will be an important work for researchers using multiway contingency tables.

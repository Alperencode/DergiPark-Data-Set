Makale Başlığı: DETERMINATION OF CAUSALITY IN TORT LAW
Özet: It is not possible for a person to be responsible for a result that he/she did not cause. Liability can only come into question because of the act that led to the re-sult. This link between the action and the result is called the causal link. The de-termination of the causal link has prepared the ground for different views in dif-ferent fields of science. In some areas, all of the conditions that lead to the result cumulatively are considered as the cause of the result, while in some areas, each of these conditions is considered exclusively as a cause. In criminal law, each of the conditions is also considered a cause, and normative limitation is provided with an objective attribution assessment after the causal link is determined. In the tort law, normative limitation is made in the causal link examination. Due to the wide range of strict liability cases in this area, this normative limitation in causal-ity analysis has a very important function. In the doctrine, various views on the normative limitation of the causal link have been put forward. Within the scope of our study, these views and their legal consequences are discussed in detail.

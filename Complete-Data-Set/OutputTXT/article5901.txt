Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Study on the Novels Jane Eyre, Tante Rosa and Sevgili Arsız Ölüm in the Context of Bildungsroman
Özet: Novelists such as Charlotte Brontë, Sevgi Soysal, and Latife Tekin have carved outa literary niche for themselves through their writings. These writers focused mainly onwomen characters mirroring gender restrictions in their milieu. When Brontë’s Jane Eyre(1847), Soysal’s Tante Rosa (1968) and Tekin’s Sevgili Arsız Ölüm (1983) are comparedwithin the framework of the bildungsroman, they have a lot in common in that they all tellthe stories of female protagonists from childhood through adulthood. The authors alsoincorporate romantic elements, which are known for elevating subjectivity, childhood,imagination and nature. The most notable aspect of these female bildungsromans is thatthe awakening of the female characters to the social roles imposed on them by societyis provided by the romantic tools. Thus, they acquire self-awareness and a sense of self.This study aims to compare the romantic elements in female bildungsromans JaneEyre, Tante Rosa, and Sevgili Arsız Ölüm to show that the female characters in thesenovels gain self-development during their journeys from childhood to maturity. As thenovels are written in different periods and societies, the effect of different cultural codes on the formation of women’s social roles and how women are represented in the novelsare also discussed.

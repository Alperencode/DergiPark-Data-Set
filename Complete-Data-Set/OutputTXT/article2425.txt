The goal of the study is to analyse the effect of the general COVID-19 outbreak-related anxiety on consumer anxiety and impulsive buying, furthermore, explaining consumer anxiety, escapism behaviour, consumers' compulsive buying behaviour, and impulsive buying behaviour relationships. In the data collection process, The researcher(s) employed an electronic questionnaire and collected data from 282 valid sources.

Besides, impulsive buying behaviour tendency has also positively affected consumer anxiety. Increased levels of consumer anxiety by both factors caused an increase in consumer escapism and compulsive buying behaviour.

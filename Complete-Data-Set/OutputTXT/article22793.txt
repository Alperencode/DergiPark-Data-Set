Makale Başlığı: Land Administration in Kyustendil in 1572
Özet: Köstendil, which came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1372, was organized as a sanjak and after a short time it began to gain the appearance of a Turkish-Islamic city. Here, of course, the development activities had a great impact. This situation naturally increased the population of the city. It is understood from the cadastral registers of the 16th century that the Muslim population is on the rise and it is mostly concentrated in the city center. The city of Kyustendil, whose lands are seen to remain within the borders of Bulgaria, Macedonia and Serbia today, is located in southwestern Bulgaria with its central and some lands. In this study, the soil system applied in Köstendil was examined. In this framework, income distribution, rate and amount numbers of has, zeamet and timar have been determined. Ishtib, Ivranya and Strumica castle officials and their duties and their timar distribution rates were examined. In addition, an explanation was given about the monasteries, communities (tribes) and voynuks in the region. The study was based on the Köstendil icmal cadastral register of 1572, registered with the number 523 in the Ottoman Archives.

Makale Başlığı: BETWEEN NATIONALISM AND UNIVERSALITY: KEMALIST JURISTS’ APPROACHES TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A UNIVERSAL PUBLIC LAW
Özet: Humanist and universalist ideas in Turkish political thought can be traced back to the Tanzimat and Constitutional periods. İbrahim Şinasi and Tevfik Fikret were the leading figures of their generations in this regard. Although Ottoman-Turkish statesmen and intellectuals were criticized within a nationalist framework during the early Republican period, it cannot be argued that their ideals were totally lost their influence on Kemalist statesmen and intellectuals. On the contrary, Atatürk, the founding father of the Republic of Turkey, tried to accommodate nationalism with universalist and humanist ideals. However Atatürk didn’t theorize his thougts; he only presented some general formulations. In this study the approaches of the Kemalist jurists such as Ethem Menemencioğlu, Cemil Bilsel and Necip Ali Küçüka to the possibilty of a universal public law will be examined to understand the theoretical bases of Kemalism which was in search of an accommodation between nationalism and universalist ideals, focusing on their published papers on this subject.

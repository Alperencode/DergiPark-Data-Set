Makale Başlığı: The Examination of Taking Off Headscarf Behaviour in the Context of the Cognitive Dissonance Theory
Özet: Being a hijabi is not only individualistic worship but is related to social, cultural, and political experiences. Therefore, wearing or taking of headscarf may not be a free decision of an individual. This study tries to find the answers to how women eliminate their cognitive dissonances in the process of taking off headscarves considering its links with social, cultural, and political experiences. In this study, 63 online letters that were published on the “yalnizyürümeyeceksin.com” website between 01.01.2020 and 01.03.2020 are chosen to be the sample. I applied content analysis to these documents. In the light of this analysis, I found that the dissonance between not wanting to wear the headscarf (1st cognition) and being hijabi (2nd cognition) can be the reason for a series of disturbances from discontentment to depression. As a result, to eliminate this dissonance, the individuals may try to use these methods to reduce the dissonance: secularizing both with the clothes and the style of living (adding supportive cognition), alienizing from the World (reducing the dissonance), describing religious life of their own family inadequate (adding supporting cognitions), emphasizing family’s oppressive attitudes (reducing the dissonance), getting economic independence (adding supportive cognition), have a separate house from family (adding supportive cognition), confirming that they do not perform other religious obligations either (adding supportive cognition). One of our findings is some individuals not only change their attitude about headscarves but also experience the conversion. Another prominent theme in the findings is some women take off their headscarves because they started to think that it is excessively hard to wear.

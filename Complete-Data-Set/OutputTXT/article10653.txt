Makale Başlığı: SEROPOSITIVITY OF HEPATITIS A IN PEDIATRIC AGE GROUPS IN KONYA
Özet: OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is common especially in developing countries worldwide. Prevalence of HAV varies according to public hygiene and sanitation conditions. In this study, it was aimed to determine seropositivity of HAV in pediatric patients in Konya province, investigate its distribution according to age groups, gender and seasons and compare findings with those reported in previous studies.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, records of 760 pediatric patients admitted to our hospital with various complaints and tested for anti-HAV immunoglobulin G(IgG)/ immunoglobulin M(IgM) between January 2019-April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Anti-HAV IgG/IgM in serum samples were analyzed by chemiluminescent microparticle enzyme immunassay method. Statistical analysis was performed by using chi-square Monte Carlo exact test.RESULTS: Anti-HAV IgG seropositivity was found to be 52.2% while anti-HAV IgM positivity was 0.5% for all patients. Seropositivity rate of anti-HAV IgG/IgM was detected as 5.3%. It was observed that anti-HAV IgG/IgM seropositivity rate significantly decreased in age groups of 9-14 (32.5%) and 15-18 (15%) compared to 3-8 (52.5%) age group (p<0.05). Males had significantly higher seropositivity rates of anti-HAV IgG (64.8%) compared with females (p<0.05). Seropositivity rate of anti-HAV IgG/IgM (42.5%) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in winter (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: HAV vaccine has been included into routine vaccination program in our country, in 2012. It was thought that anti-HAV IgG seropositivity might be related to maternal antibodies in patients under two years of age and its higher rate in 3-8 age group compared to other age groups has been the result of routine vaccination. Seropositivity rate of anti-HAV IgG/IgM together significantly increased in winter. This can be explained by insufficiency of sewerage and infrastructure systems with increasing rainfall in this season. Frequency of HAV infection can be reduced by strict follow-up of vaccine administration and attention to hygiene and sanitation conditions.

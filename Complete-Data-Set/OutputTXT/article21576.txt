Makale Başlığı: Morphology and phylogeny of a new soil ciliate, Colpodidiumzelihayildizae n. sp. (Ciliophora, Nassophorea, Colpodidiidae), from Van, Turkey
Özet: A new ciliate species Colpodidium zelihayildizae n. sp., which was discovered in a dry irrigation channel in Van (Turkey), was investigated morphologically using standard live and silver impregnation methods, and its SSU rRNA gene phylogeny was provided. This  new  species  was  characterized  as  follows:  body  size  about  40−60  ×  15−20  μm  in  vivo,  elongated  ellipsoidal  with  flat  or  slightly  concave ventral surface; the buccal cavity slightly below equatorial plane; macronucleus spherical or slightly elliptical, usually located in the last third of the cell; cortex distinctly furrowed in the anterior half; 19–22 somatic kineties, 4 postoral kineties; paroral membrane has 20 dikinetids; 3 nassulid organelles (NOs), with NO1 very close to the left edge of the paroral membrane, which consists of 1 dikinetid pair.  Phylogenetic  analyses  conducted  on  the  SSU  rDNA  sequences  determined  that  Colpodidium  zelihayildizae  was  clustered  with  Colpodidium caudatum and formed a clade with Apocolpodidium etoschense and Colpodididae sp.

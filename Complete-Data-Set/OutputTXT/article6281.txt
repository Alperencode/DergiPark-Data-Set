Makale Başlığı: Determination of Grapevine Rootstocks Resistancy to Cadmium (Cd) Toxicity
Özet: In this study, response of 12 grapevine rootstock genotypes  to cadmium (Cd) toxicity were investigated. The Cd application to the soil was made at the beginning of the experiment at 4 different (0, 5, 10 ve 20 mg Cd kg-1)  doses. Shoot, leaf and root dry matter yields, leaf Cd, N, P and Zn contents were determined to assess genotype tolerance of Cd toxicity. Present findings revealed that based on shoot, leaf and root dry weights, leaf Cd, N, P and Zn contents, there were Cd-sensitive and resistant genotypes among the present ones. At the greatest Cd dose (Cd20), the greatest Cd contents (µg plant-1) were observed in 8B (6.13), 420A (5.35) and 1103P (4.69) rootstocks and the lowest Cd contents were observed in 99R (1.27) and SO4 (1.58) rootstocks. Among the grapevine rootstocks, SO4 with quite lower leaf Cd accumulation than the other genotypes and increasing shoot and leaf dry weights and leaf N, P and Zn content was identified as resistant against toxic Cd conditions. On the other hand, 8B, 420A, 1103P, 5BB, Harmony genotypes with decreasing shoot, leaf and root dry weights under Cd toxicity conditions, higher leaf Cd accumulations and significantly decreasing leaf N, P and Zn contents were considered as sensitive to Cd toxicity.

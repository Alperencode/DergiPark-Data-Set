Makale Başlığı: VOLUNTARY CHANGE OF PARTY IN ENFORCEMENT LAW
Özet: The plaintiff determines the other party in the petition at the stage of filing the lawsuit. During the proceeding, both parties can change to the existing parties. Voluntary change of parties is a concept regulated in Article 124 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The change of party is regulated in this article in two ways. Accordingly, the change of party can be made with the express consent of the other party or secondly with the permission of the judge. There are different approaches in the doctrine regarding the legal nature of the voluntary change in the party. In this study, first of all, these approaches of the doctrine will be evaluated, and then, based on these approaches, the change of party in enforcement law will be assessed. First of all, whether a voluntary change is possible in terms of enforcement proceedings will be examined within the framework of judiciary, and then the change of party will be discussed for some legal remedies and lawsuits applied within the framework of enforcement law. In this context, the legal nature of the complaint, the annulment of the objection, the cancellation of the objection, the compensation and the negative declaratory action have been taken into account. It has been explained whether a voluntary change of a party as it is regulated in the Code of Civil Procedure is possible in terms of each specified procedure. Accordingly, how and to what extent the relevant provision will be implemented will be discussed within the framework of doctrines and judicial decisions.

Makale Başlığı: Effect Of Bone Ash and Compatibilizer on the Mechanical Properties of PP/PA6 Matrix Composites
Özet: In this study, the effects of bone ash and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) additives used in polypropylene (PP)/polyamide 6 (PA6) blends on the mechanical and also tribological properties of the composites were investigated. Bone powder is a waste material especially in food industry. The use of bone powder in polymer matrix composites is important because of the reduction of petroleum-based content in the composites and its advantage of biodegradable characteristic. The composites were produced using a twin-screw extruder by melt blending method and then molded to sample sizes to be used in mechanical and tribological tests by injection molding. Tensile test, three-point bending test, Shore D hardness test and ball-on-disc sliding wear tests were applied to the composites and the results were compared according to the composite composition. When the results were examined, it was found that the bone ash additive was more effective on the hardness and the compatibilizer additive was more effective on the tensile and bending strength. The highest mechanical properties were achieved with 20% and 30% bone ash additives. It has been found that bone ash is also very effective in reducing the friction coefficients, especially when used with compatibilizer it reduces the wear resistance significantly (up to 98%). In summary, PP/PA6 matrix composites obtained with the synergistic effect of bone ash and MAPP are promising for applications requiring mechanical and wear resistance.

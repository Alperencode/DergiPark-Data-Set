Makale Başlığı: LIPID COMPOSITION OF PAULOWNIA SEEDS GROWN IN BULGARIA
Özet: The chemical composition of seeds from paulownia (Paulownia tomentosa) was investigated. The main components in the triacylglycerol fraction of the oil were linoleic (64.1%), oleic (21.2%) and palmitic acids (7.3%). ?-Tocopherol (approx. 100.0%) predominated in the tocopherol fraction, and in the sterol fraction – ß-sitosterol (79.2%), campesterol (10.3%) and stigmasterol (7.7%). In the seeds were established 10.6% protein, 9.5% cellulose and 38.2% hydrolysable carbohydrates.

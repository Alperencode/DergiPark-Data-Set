Makale Başlığı: The Lending Behavior of Investment and Development Banks in Turkey:  Evidence from Quantile Regression Approach
Özet: The major aim of this paper is to analyze the extent to which the lending behavior of 14 investment and development banks in Turkiye is responsive to different quantiles of selected three core variables (i.e., (i) non-performing loans/total cash loans ratio (%), (ii) net profit/equity ratio (%), and (iii) liabilities/equity ratio (%)) for the period between 2005/January and 2020/December. The estimation of a change in the degree of lending behavior, proxied by total loans/total assets ratio (%), is stimulated through an  endogenous  model  where  different  quantile  regression  models are performed to examine the miscellaneous relationship among the selected variables and to correct potential diagnostic problems  stemming  from  the  endogeneous  regressors  in  the  panel  data  analysis.  The  empirical  results  imply  that  there  are  two fundamental outputs produced in regression analyses: On the one hand, the lending behavior is affected only by the non-performing loans/total cash loans ratio with a negative coefficient sign  and  the  liabilities/equity  ratio  with  a  positive  coefficient  sign,  mostly  at  the  lowest  quantiles.  On  the  other  hand,  the  highest quantiles showed that the coefficients of these variables are insignificant. In addition, the net profit/equity ratio is only significant with a negative coefficient sign in limited quantiles. This  means  that  there  is  a  mild  heterogeneity  of  statistically  significant variables across different quantiles where the lowest quartile  of  lending  behavior  of  investment  and  development  banks is not confronted with the higher level of financial activities.

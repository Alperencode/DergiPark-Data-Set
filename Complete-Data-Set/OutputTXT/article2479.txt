Özet: Retailing is one of the indispensable elements of the consumption economy in today’s world. Retailing, a bridge between the consumer and the product, expresses a wide range of products and services as a concept. The retail definition includes markets, stores, and service providers. The retail sector is rapidly affected by the trends emerging in the changing world with technological developments. Digitalization, new consumer behaviors and the conveniences brought by technology and alternative channels are also conducive to the redefinition of retailing. For example, the Covid-19 outbreak has led retail channels worldwide to shift from conventional merchandising to online sales channels called electronic commerce. In this study, the conceptual change and development of the retail sector in the new period, as well as the sector in the world and Turkey, are looked at from the perspective of the effects triggered by the Pandemic. The emerging changes are examined and the experiences in food retail are discussed. “Cooperative Markets”, which has evolved into a significant success story for Turkey, is reviewed in detail, and the situation of the markets in the Thrace Region is examined.

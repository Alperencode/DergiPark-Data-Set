Özet: The study “The Sultan’s Fleet: Seafarers of the Ottoman Empire” by Christine Isom-Verhaaren, in which she discusses the seafarers who served in the Ottoman navy from the pre-Ottoman period to the early 18th century, is analyzed in this review. In this paper, as well as the sources she used, I examined the chapters of the book, the information, and the observations she presented. This book provides value as a noteworthy academic work focused on Ottoman sailors within a particular context, even though it is not the first study on Ottoman seafarers.

Makale Başlığı: Similarities of Management Response: The Case of Tripadvisor
Özet: Thanks to the developing internet technologies, online shopping has become an important part of our daily life and economy. Tourism products, on the ot-her hand, have become one of the most accepted products by customers. The intangible features of tourism products that have been difficult to evaluate have caused consumers to place more emphasis on online consumer reviews, which provide information on both positive and negative aspects of products to reduce uncertainty. On the other hand, the negative effects of increasing complaints and negative comments sharing on the online customers' purchasing decisions caused online platforms such as TripAdvisor to start offering business management responsibilities to such comments. Studies show that the answers given by the management include stereotypes made up of thanks and apology. In this context, the aim of the study is to examine the similarity levels of the responses given by the management despite the comments shared by the consumers in the online environment by text mining methods. In the study, the management responses for 1000 online reviews of the top 10 hotel businesses operating in the Antalya region on TripAdvisor, were used as data. As a result, although some terms are frequently used in the management responses, the similarity levels of the management responses are found to be low.

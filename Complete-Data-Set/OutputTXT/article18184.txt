Makale Başlığı: THE CASE OF AFGHANISTAN IN NATO’S STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATION CONCEPT IN COMBATING TERRORISM
Özet: StratCom is a comparatively new term that has become almost a buzzword in many areas, including the military. It has no agreed definition, but is usually associated with winning people’s hearts and minds. The human factor is very important in strategic communication, as it is vital to understand, and to interact, engage, and communicate with, the public. StratCom is the synchronization of all communication and information-related attempts directed at the target audience in order to form, strengthen or maintain an idea or attitude that is in the interest of the operation or implemented policy. This paper analyses StratCom efforts of the NATO-led ISAF forces, which have been in combat in Afghanistan since 2003. It argues that StratCom has played a crucial role in achieving success for the Alliance and coalition forces in Afghanistan because to effectively combat terrorism, modern warfare requires a comprehensive approach rather than solely military power.

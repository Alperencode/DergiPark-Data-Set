Makale Başlığı: EUROPEAN UNION, POSITIVE PEACE CONCEPTION AND  THE THEORIES OF WAR
Özet: This study aims to reveal how the European integration process provided opportunity for the positive peace among European states. Apart from the classical theories of integration such as functionalism, neo-functionalism or federalism, the reducing effect of European mechanisms/rules upon the war proneness of nations are discussed within the frame of war theories. In this context, it is argued that the EU institutions, body of rules and frameworks have a reduction effect on war proneness of European nations. Based on the peace scale that developed by Klein, Goertz and Diehl (2006), this argument is examined within the system, dyadic and state levels of war theories in the scope of the article. Theories of war about these three levels help explain that the European Union has a significant impact on declining militarization, controlling of excessive capacity development, decreasing proclivities of conflict resolution through power politics, reinforcing to resolve territorial problems by peaceful methods, encouraging to construct a pluralistic security community and has thus achieved construction of a stable hierarchy between and among European nations. In that sense, the finding of war theories indicate that the EU provides a measurable positive peace, obviously fit for positive peace in the scale, which makes the war improbable among European nations.

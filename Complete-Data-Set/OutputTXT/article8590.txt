Makale Başlığı: AIR CONDITIONING IN THE RESTORATION OF ŞERIFLER MANSION EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF INTERIOR DESIGN
Özet: The Bosphorus mansions were mostly used as the summer residences of sultans during the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, no warming was required. Each mansion had their own land, starting from the sea and rising up the hill. Thanks to the grove and plan type of the mansions, there was no ventilation and cooling problem.However, today the mansions have started to be used in four seasons. Due to the developing technology, comfort and air conditioning problems arise due to the fact that the needs are at the maximum level and that the mansions do not have the groves and lands anymore. In this study, the effects of the air conditioning systems of the Şerifler Mansion, which has been restored in 1970, on the interior will be investigated. At the same time the view of the relevant institutions on the mechanical project of the Şerifler mansion will be evaluated and the physical benefits of renovation projects will be investigated. The Şerifler mansion is a 1st degree registered building and is located in Sarıyer, Emirgan. It is also one of the most beautiful mansions the Bosphorus has. Today, it is used by the Association of Historical Cities and ÇEKUL Foundation.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Mass Housing and Social Housing Production in the Context of Globalization: Examples from Around the World And Turkey
Özet: Due to the incapacity of lower-income groups in societies to meet their housing needs because of industrialization, rapid urbanization, population growth, compulsory migration after World Wars and other conflicts, governments implemented mass housing construction, including mass housing and social housing. This research aims to look at the influence of culture and globalization on mass housing and low-cost social housing created in the world and Turkey after 2000, in conjunction with central and local regulations. Twenty mass and social housing projects completed after 2000 in various countries were analysed using multiple criteria as part of the study’s scope (design firm, budget and investor, housing features, social and public spaces and settlement schema). In the projects examined, it has been observed that there are similarities and differences in the design, planning and implementation stages of mass and social housing projects implemented in the world and Turkey, and a comparative analysis has been made between the projects selected according to certain common characteristics. According to the findings obtained from the analysis, it can be effective and efficient to produce houses that take into account the local climate and materials, environmental values, the needs of the users, and offer different types of housing, personal and common activity areas and social areas, instead of standard mass housing produced in a similar way all over the world. The study is significant in terms of studying and comparing mass and social housing for poor and middle-income groups in many countries, as well as concluding effective and sustainable housing and its environs. For future research, it is suggested that mass and social housing concepts be developed in accordance with local regulations, economics, cultural, and social characteristics of the countries.

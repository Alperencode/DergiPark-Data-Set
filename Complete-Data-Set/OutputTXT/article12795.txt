Makale Başlığı: Solutions for KMM System and Generalized Hyperelastic-Rod Wave Equation
Özet: In this study, the Kraenkel-Manna-Merle (KMM) system and generalized hyperelastic-rod wave equation have been investigated. For this, generalized Kudryashov method (GKM), which is one of the solution methods of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs), has been implemented to KMM system and generalized hyperelastic-rod wave equation. Some solutions to the discussed equations have been found and visualized using Wolfram Mathematica 12 in two and three dimensions.

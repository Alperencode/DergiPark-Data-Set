Makale Başlığı: A Theoretical Discussion on The Components of the Promotion and a Definition Suggestion
Özet: In this study, first of all, a literature review on promotion was conducted in order to identify the uncertainties and debates in the literature regarding the promotion component of the marketing mix. In this process, uncertainties were identified on the definition of the concept of promotion, its components and in particular the sub-components of personal selling, direct and digital marketing and sales development.In the study conducted as a theoretical discussion, the concept of promotion was defined as “The coordination of personal selling, public relations, advertising, direct and digital marketing and sales development tools within the framework of integrated marketing communication in order to affect consumer behavior in this context to increase and support primarily marketing strategy and then the sales and to ensure the sustainability of products in market conditions with all kinds of abstract and concrete positioning and to support marketing policies”. In addition, a classification error arising from the tool-purpose confusion in personal sales and direct and digital marketing sub-components and errors in the sales development sub-component due to short-long-term applications were determined and new classification proposals in these areas were brought to the literature with their justifications.This study contributes to the literature by suggesting a new definition for the concept of promotion and a new classification for its sub-components. The fact that today's society is called a promotion culture shows the importance of the subject that the study examines.

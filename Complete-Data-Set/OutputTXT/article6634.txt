Makale Başlığı: The Moderating Role of Generational Difference in Adoption of Anthropomorphic Robots for Restaurants: An Extension to the UTAUT model with Socialization and Innovativeness
Özet: The aim of this research is to confirm the unified technology acceptance and utilization theory (UTAUT) in the context of humanoid robot and restaurant, and to contribute to the theory through touristic socialization and touristic innovativeness variables. In this context, the data obtained from 363 participants with restaurant experience were subjected to structural equation modeling. As a result of the study, it was determined that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions, which are the predictive variables of the UTAUT model, are seen to positively and significantly affect the behavioral intention to experience humanoid robots in restaurants. Among these, it was seen that facilitating conditions came to the fore as the variable with the strongest predictive power. Performance expectancy and social influence emerged as the other two strongest antecedents explaining behavioral intention. Besides, it was observed that tourist innovativeness positively affected behavioral intention, while the tourist socialization variable were seen to have any significant effect on behavioral intention. Also, social influence was determined as the most effective variable for X generation. As a moderating variable, it was seen that the participants within Y-Z generations give more importance to the facilitating conditions in adopting humanoid robots compared to the X generation.

Özet: This study focuses on the expectations of individuals with visual and orthopedic disabilities regarding the solution to the problems they experienced. Therefore, the main purpose of the study is to reveal the expectations of individuals with disabilities both from public institutions and organizations and from the social structure. In this context, the qualitative research method was used in the study. The study group of the research consisted of 23 individuals with visual and orthopedic disabilities. Individuals were interviewed using a Semi-Structured Interview Form to collect data. After the transcriptions of the collected data, the encodings were made with the help of the MAXQDA program, and the data were subjected to descriptive analysis for evaluation. As a result of the study, it was found that individuals with disabilities have expectations from public institutions and organizations to ensure social participation, increase employment, solve economic problems, and take their views into account in developing the regulations. In addition, it was found in the study that individuals with disabilities expect the abandonment of exclusionary, discriminatory, and pity-oriented understanding in society, replacing this approach with respect and understanding.

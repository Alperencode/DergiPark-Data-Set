Makale Başlığı: A COMPLEX OF LITERATURE AND GEOGRAPHY: ALBANIA AND ALBANIA
Özet: On the basis of chauvinistic ethnic nationalism in the Balkans, while each nation positions itself as the earliest people in the region, the perception that sees the neighboring nation either as traitors who have cooperated with the enemies and converted, or as nations that have come to the field afterwards and should not have any sovereignty over the land prevails. Accordingly, what is widely expressed by Serbian theses is to link the origin of Albanians to the east. Here, an effort to associate Caucasian Albania with Albanians appears. However, Caucasian Albania is not a place where Albanians live in terms of language and ethnicity. This area was the homeland of the today’s Udi nation. The global similarity in the naming of here, originating from the Latin-based word, ALBA, is due to the use of the same word, both for Shqiperia, the homeland of Albanians, and for the homeland of the Udis in the past. The situation in question is in fact not different from the linguistic poverty and a generalizing view in the eyes of the people who work on this thesis. In the study, why the places where these two nations live are called by the same name will be explained and the unreality of this will be revealed.

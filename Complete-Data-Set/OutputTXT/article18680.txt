Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Sensitivity to AZD7762 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) with RBFOX2 Gene Expression as a Biomarker
Özet: Objective:  Triple  negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC)  is  one  of  the  most  metastatic,  aggressive  with  poor  prognosis  types  of  breast  cancers.  There is currently no standard molecular-targeted treatment for TNBC. Therefore, new therapeutics should be developed. The aim of this study  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  AZD7762  on  several  breast  cancer  cell  lines  and  evaluate  the  RBFOX2  gene  expression  levels  as  a  marker to show sensitivity to this drug.Materials  and  Methods:  The  cytotoxic  effect  of  AZD7762  on  breast  cancer  cell  lines  was  determined  by  sulforhodamine  B  method.  The expression levels of RBFOX2 gene were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The association between the IC50 values of the selected drug AZD7762 and RBFOX2 expression levels was evaluated by using Pearson r correlation analysis.Results:  Although  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  IC50  values  of  TNBC  and  non-TNBC  groups,  it  was  determined  that  TNBC  cell  lines  tended  to  be  more  sensitive  to  AZD7762.  In  addition,  it  was  obvious  that  increasing  levels  of  RBFOX2  expression  were  detected in cells that showed more sensitivity to AZD7762. Conclusion: It was concluded that the RBFOX2 gene can be used as a biomarker to show AZD7762 efficiency. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential signaling mechanisms that are associated with the effect of AZD7762.

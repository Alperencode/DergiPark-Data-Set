Makale Başlığı: Ultrasound-Guided Bilateral İnfraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block
Özet: Anesthesiologists avoid multiple peripheral nerve block applications due to the increased risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. In selected patients correctly, the risk of complications will be minimized in the block procedure to be applied with low volume and correct local anesthetic selection within the safe dose limits under ultrasound guidance. It is aimed to share the case experience of the bilateral infraclavicular block, which has not been encountered with any complications and has been applied successfully.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation on the Expression Profile of Immune-Related Genes in Response to Lipopolysaccharide and Lipoteichoic Acid in Alveolar Macrophages of Akkaraman and Romanov Lambs
Özet: The alveolar macrophages (AMs) are frontier of defense against foreign materials that initiate immune response in lungs. Knowledge of the expression dynamics of major immune-related genes in the alveolar macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) challenge can help to understand disease mechanism involved in several respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the mRNA expression of selected immune-related genes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) challenge in sheep alveolar macrophages in vivo. Results revealed that Romanov lambs exhibited higher mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR4, NF-ĸβ, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 genes as compared to Akkaraman lambs along with the control of all treatments. Moreover, the expression of TLR2, TLR4, NF-ĸβ, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 genes was higher in combine treatment of LPS and LTA as compared to separate treatments of LPS and LTA in both breeds. The results showed that the mRNA expression of immune-related genes was significantly increased in the sheep AMs in response to LPS and LTA treatment whereas a synergistic effect was observed in LPS+LTS treatment. Also, breed comparison showed that the native Akkaraman was more resistant to disease compared to exotic Romanov.

Makale Başlığı: The Emotional Power of Visual: On the Representation of Migrants, Refugees and Aslyum Seekers in Global Visual Politics
Özet: Today, visual studies and emotional studies show a significant development by feeding each other. The triggering of feelings, emotions and thoughts by visuals that provide us reference in our making sense of the world, in other words, the emotional power of visuals constitutes the intersection point of these two sub-disciplines. As the common theme of these two fields, the visual representations of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the media plays an important role in mobilizing and collectivizing a range of emotions on a global scale. The aim of this study is to analyse how immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers are visualized and how these images turn into emotional and political outputs. These visual representations have the power to lead different emotions; while some visuals activate feelings of empathy and compassion and provide collective solidarity, others stimulate negative emotions such as fear and anger giving rise to securitization policies and practices of exclusion.

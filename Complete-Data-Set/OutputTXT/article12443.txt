Makale Başlığı: Transposition in narrative levels: A Comparative Study of Frankenstein in Baghdad by Ahmad Saadawi and Frankenstein by Mary Shelly
Özet: Transformation is one of the hypertextuality elements. Whenever hypertext and hypotext have a serious relationship and this transformation occurs in narratıve moode, then the serious transformation occures in hypertext. The serious changes cause transposition. Frankenstein in Baghdad is a novel written by Ahmad Saadawi. This novel is an adaptation of the Frankenstein novel by Mary Shelly, but the time and place, style, and content transformation leads to transposition. Therefore, transformation in narrative moodes in addition to narrative levels have led to a transposition. Transformation at narrative levels leads to transformation in the hypertext, affecting the events and levels of the narrative in the hypertext. This research according to Gerard Genet's theory studies the narrative levels in both texts and emphasizes on transformation in hypertext. Transformation in narrative levels and the placement of similar characters at different levels of narrative and reverse move in extradiegetik and intradiegetik in hypertext cause the transposition. Because of breaching between levels, the character located at the inner level in the hypotext appears on higher level in hypertext. Transposition makes character, which is at the top level in the hypertext, move from the outer level to the inner level of the narrative. Based on these changes, polyphonic and polycentric world is a situation encountered in the hypertext along with creating a new world.

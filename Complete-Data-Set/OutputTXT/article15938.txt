Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Physical and Mechanical Properties of Medium Density Fibreboards (MDF) Produced from Iron Tree (Casuarina equisetifolia L.) Wood
Özet: In this study, ironwood (Casuarina equisetifolia L.) raw material was used. 1.17 moles of urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin (12.5%), solid paraffin (1.5%) and 10% ammonium chloride solution were added to the fibers. Boards with a density of 0.694 g/cm³ were produced in the MDF production line. The physical and mechanical properties of the boards were evaluated. Swelling in thickness for 2 and 24 h were 2.53% and 6.01%, respectively. Modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and internal bonding strenght were 35.2 N/mm2, 2982.8 MPa, and 0.42 MPa, respecitvely. Average moisture content of the boards was 7.9%. According to results, except for IB, both physical and mechanical properties of the boards produced using ironwood (Casuarina equisetifolia L.)  were higher than the TS EN standard.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Importance of Advanced Age for Histopathological Prognostic Data in Patients with Kidney Tumor
Özet: Kidney tumors are more common in males, and are often considered to be in the category of older-age tumors. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the importance of age in terms of histopathological prognostic data for kidney tumors, with many defined histopathological prognostic parameters. Twenty–four patients >75 years, who were diagnosed with kidney cancer with nephrectomy between 2010 and 2020, were included in study. The relation between histological features as histological subtype, grade of the tumor, presence of lymphovascular, perineural, hilar and perirenal adipose tissue invasion, necrosis, and the state of surgical margins were determined. Twenty-three tumor samples were classified as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). One sample was classified as multilocular cystic renal cell neoplasm with low malignancy potential. The histopathological subtypes of RCC were; clear cell RCC (n=19), chromophobe RCC (n=2), Type 1 papillary RCC (n=1), and Type 2 papillary RCC (n=1), respectively. Among the histopathological data, renal vein invasion showed statistical significance in terms of survival (p=0.002). In addition, a significant relationship was observed between increasing tumor grade and LVI (p=0.009). Tumor size, and grade, presence of necrosis, lymph node metastasis, perirenal adipose tissue and renal vein invasion are among the prognostic markers for RCC. However, in our series of advanced age cases, only renal vein invasion was found to be prognostic for survival, while other identified markers did not have a significant effect on this age group. This phenomenon indicates that advanced age tumors may differ from tumors in other ages, and the data used routinely may therefore be insufficient to predict the course of the disease.

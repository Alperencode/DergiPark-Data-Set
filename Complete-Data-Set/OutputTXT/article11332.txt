Makale Başlığı: Fibonacci Lacunary Ideal Convergence of Double Sequences in Intuitionistic Fuzzy Normed Linear Spaces
Özet: The purpose of this article is to research the concept of Fibonacci lacunary ideal convergence of double sequences in intuitionistic fuzzy normed linear spaces (IFNS). Additionally, a new concept, called Fibonacci lacunary convergence, is examined. Also, Fibonacci lacunary I₂-limit points and Fibonacci lacunary I₂-cluster points for double sequences in IFNS have been defined and the significant results have been given. Additionally, Fibonacci lacunary Cauchy and Fibonacci lacunary I₂-Cauchy double sequences are worked.

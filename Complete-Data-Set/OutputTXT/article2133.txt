Makale Başlığı: Acute Effect of Small-Sided Game-Based Warm-Up on Change of Direction Speed Performance
Özet: This research aims to examine the acute effect of no warm-up versus a small-sided game-based warm-up on change of direction speed performance (Illinois agility test). Small-sided games prior to training and competition is a valid strategy used to improve performance. These benefits resulted from combined methods of small-sided games with passive rest. A total of seventy-one male subjects participated in the study between national team players of team sport and university students from regular sport class. A randomized crossover trial design was used to determine differences in change of direction performance between the two warm-up conditions. According to the random order assigned, all participants completed two conditions, warm-up and no warm-up. An analysis of variance in three ways with repeated measures in two factors was conducted to analyze data. The ANOVA interaction between group x treatment x measurement show no significant difference (F=0,081 sig= 0,778, p> 0.05). The present study concludes that the warm-up with small-sided games is not the causal factor in a change of direction test performance.

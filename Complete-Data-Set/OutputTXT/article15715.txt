Makale Başlığı: EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN HERITAGE CONSERVATION
Özet: This article has been prepared by the invitation of the ICOMOS Turkey Education Committee to share the author's personal experiences in education and training. Here, a significant emphasis is placed on the author's experience at ICCROM from 1971 to 1998. There are several reasons for this. The Second World War provided an important additional input to international developments in education and training, and ICCROM became a focal point in the process. The ICCROM was created by UNESCO to not only advise on conservation principles and approaches, but also – and perhaps more specifically – to advise on the development of international educational models in the conservation of different types of heritage resources. In this paper, the historical development of educational activities in the field of cultural heritage is analyzed with a comprehensive and detailed approach based on the author's personal experience, under the titles of 'Bases in ICCROM', 'Contribution to the Educational Guide', 'World Heritage Consulting'. It is hoped that it will shed light on the future. Recognition of heritage requires awareness, knowledge and hard work, so collaboration with building owners is needed as well as with managers and experts. In order to secure sustainable management for their heritage, it is necessary to understand what a 'heritage community' expects.

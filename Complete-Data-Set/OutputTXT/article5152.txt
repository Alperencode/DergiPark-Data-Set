Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF INNOVATIVE CULTURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND FIRM PERFORMANCE
Özet: The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of innovative culture and organizational learning on firm performance and the mediating role of technological innovation in these relationships. The questionnaire method was used as a data collection tool. For the innovative culture scale, the study of Ogbonna and Harris (2000) was used and the scale consists of 4 items. The organizational learning scale was adapted from the study of Jiménez-Jiménez and Sanz-Valle (2011) and consists of 13 items. Technological innovation scale was adapted from the study of Lee et al. (2014) and consists of 9 items. Firm performance scale was adapted from the study of Wang et al. (2014) and consists of 11 items. The research data were collected from 119 firms operating in the manufacturing industry in the Organized Industrial Zones in Gebze. The collected data were analyzed using AMOS. As a result of the analysis, it was found that innovative culture and organizational learning have a positive and significant effect on firm performance. In addition, it was found that technological innovation has a mediator effect on the relationship between organizational learning and firm performance, but no mediating effect of technological innovation was found on the relationship between innovative culture and firm performance. These findings reveal that firm managers should attach importance to technological innovations, create an innovative culture in their firms and improve organizational learning to increase firm performance.

Makale Başlığı: Being pregnant in Covid-19 (Fear of Giving Birth, Fear of Covid-19, and Marital Adjustment)
Özet: This research aims to examine the relationship between fear of childbirth, fear of Covid-19, and marital adjustment. In line with this general-purpose, differences in fear of childbirth, fear of Covid-19, and marital adjustment levels were also examined according to demographic variables. The research was carried out with 382 pregnant women who were followed up in the obstetrics clinic of a private hospital in Ankara. Demographic Information Form, Wijma Birth Expectation-Experience Scale (W-DEQ) Version A, Fear of Covid-19 Scale, and Revised Dynasty Scale were used as data collection tools. Independent Sample T-test and One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the scores obtained from fear of childbirth, fear of Covid-19, and spousal adjustment according to demographic variables. The relationship of the variables with each other was tested with Pearson Correlation analysis, and the predictive effect of fear of Covid-19 and spousal adjustment on fear of childbirth was examined by regression analysis. As a result of the research, while there was a difference in fear of birth according to age, there was a difference in both fear of birth and fear of Covid-19 according to health problems. In addition, the fear of Covid-19 differs according to the gestational week. A positive relationship was found between fear of childbirth and fear of Covid-19 and a negative relationship between marital adjustment. In addition, it was determined that fear of Covid-19 and spousal adjustment significantly predicted fear of childbirth.

Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of the Relationship Between Speed-Based Verbal Reasoning Subtest of Anadolu-Sak Intelligence Scale and Perceptual Speed Tests
Özet: This research has two interrelated aims. The first aim of the research is to present the relationship between the Speed Based Verbal Reasoning (SBVR) subtest, which calculates reasoning speed by adjusting the Anadolu-Sak Intelligence Scale (ASIS) Verbal Reasoning (VR) subtest, and the CAS 2 intelligence scale and RIAS-2 intelligence scale speed subtests. The second aim of the research is to examine the reliability of the SBVR subtest, the item-total correlations and its relationship to the ASIS index scores. The research employed a correlational survey model and the study sample consisted of 211 students aged 6 to 7. The reliability of the SBVR subtest was found to be high (α =.84). However, we found that there is a small level relationship between SBVR and speed variables (rHDSAM-SPS =-.16, rHDSAM-PNM =.18, rHDSAM-ND =.21 and rHDSAM-SNT =.20), a moderate level (r =.35) relationship with the memory capacity index, and a moderate level (r=.31) and significant relationship with the nonverbal potential index. The research demonstrates the discrepancy between the reasoning speed and the perceptual speed.

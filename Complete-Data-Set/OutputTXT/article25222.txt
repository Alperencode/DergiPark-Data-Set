Makale Başlığı: The Scrutinising of Changes in the Aquaculture Supports
Özet: In the world, aquaculture is seen as the fastest growing and developing food production sector and however, in the near future, it is estimated that the rates of fisheries and aquaculture will be equalized. In 2015, the fisheries production of the world amounted to 170,345,641 tons (fisheries; 93,704,616 tons and aquaculture; 76,641,025 tons) according to the FAO records. The aquaculture in Turkey started in 1970s and its rate in total fisheries production has rapidly increased as of 2000. In our country, the amount of aquaculture, which was 79,943 tons in 2003, reached 253,395 tons in 2016. The aquaculture rate in the total production of our country has increased by more than 310%. As one of the most important reasons for this rate increase, it is seen to be providing some support policies with various incentive systems by the government for support and encourage the aquaculture in country. Directly product support for aquaculture farmers was started in 2003. According to the total capacity of the farms, total product and fry supports were provided. In 2008, the total capacity supported was limited to 2000 tons/year. However, in 2012, different tonnage application (whole unit price to 250 tons/year and ½ unit price from 251 to 500 tons/year) were brought to the total product support and the fry support was removed. At the same time, the processed product support was brought at the rate of twice the amount specified in the invoices of the total product. In the present, the support system is still continuing. The types of product support, prices, supported capacities and the expense criteria are applied annually by issuing the “Aquaculture Support Communiqués” in the Official Gazette.

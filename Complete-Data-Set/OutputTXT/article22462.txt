Makale Başlığı: Ghana-China relations at the intersection of neocolonialism and the new scramble for Africa debates
Özet: The term neocolonialism, which was quite mainstream to analyse Euro-African relations at the time of the independence, has become popular in the media and academia in the last decades. Particularly, China-Africa relations have been evaluated within this framework by the Western point of view. Although China has placed itself in a different position rather than the old colonial powers, it is observed that the similar patterns of dependency have been created. In this article, Ghana-China relations in the last decades, including the new scramble for Africa discussions, have been analysed with the term neocolonialism which was coined by Ghanaian leader Nkrumah to criticise West and the colonial relations.

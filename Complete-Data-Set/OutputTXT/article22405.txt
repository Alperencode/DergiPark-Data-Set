Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of Detail Design Student Studio Studies within the Scope of Interior Architecture Education
Özet: Detail design constructs the application phase of the architectural design process. The construction of the application is necessary for the successful completion of the architectural design process. Due to this importance, the subject of detail design is seen as a priority in the architecture and interior architecture departments where architectural design education is given. According to the hypothesis, which forms the basis of the understanding on this subject within the scope of the study and is based on, the adaptability of the details increases the manageability of the design, production and use processes of the structure. On this basis, a comparative process was carried out within the scope of Cukurova University Interior Architecture Department Materials and Interior Construction-5 course. During the term, students were asked to express what the architectural detail evokes in two and three dimensions. In the process, students' first views on detail analysis and their approaches after transferring the detail design hypothesis were compared. In this context, the connection methods used by the students and the potential to create adaptive details were evaluated through scaled detail model studies. According to the results obtained from this evaluation, suggestions for the relationship between detail design and architectural design education are presented.

Makale Başlığı: A Lipoid Pneumonia After Machine Oil Ingestion: A Rare Case Report
Özet: Aim: Lipoid pneumonia is a clinical and radiological disease that occurs after aspiration of oil-basedfluid into the lung. In this case, it is aimed to present a case of exogenous lipoid pneumonia due toaccidental machine oil ingestion as a cause of unresolved pneumonia.Case: A 62-year-old male patient presented to the chest disease polyclinic for control because of theaspiration of the machine oil 20 days ago. It was learned that antibiotics were started on an outpatientwith a preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia, but there was no radiological improvement. He had a historyof benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypothyroidism. In addition, 38% polymorphous core leukocytes,27% lymphocytes, 29% alveolar macrophages were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage sample.Methylprednisolone 32 mg/day peroral was started, with the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia. Aftertreatment, he had radiological improvement in the control chest X-ray and was followed up as anoutpatient.Conclusion: The diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia can be missed because of its clinical and radiologicalconfusion with other pneumonia types. In conclusion, the patient’s anamnesis, clinic and imaging shouldbe carefully evaluated and followed up while making the differential diagnosis of non-healing pneumonia.

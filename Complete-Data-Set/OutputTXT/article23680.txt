Makale Başlığı: RETURN OF GIFTS AS A LEGAL CONSEQUENCE OF BREAKING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT
Özet: Couples who want to marry each other take the first step into marriage with engagement. At the time of the engagement or within the engagement period, the engaged couple and their relatives give each other various gifts. However, the engagement relationship does not always end with marriage. One of the legal consequences that will arise if the engagement is broken is the return of gifts received by virtue of engagement. It is designated in Article 122 of the Turkish Civil Code that the gifts exchanged due to engagement shall be returned if the engagement ends for a reason other than marriage. As per the provision, it is specified that not only the gifts exchanged by the engaged couple but also the parents or the persons who act like parents can request the return of the gifts they have given to the other fiancé(e). Those which can be requested back are the uncustomary gifts. The parties can request the return of the gifts only if the engagement has ended for a reason other than marriage. On the other hand, the gifts given by an engaged person to third parties and the gifts exchanged by the engaged person’s parents or relatives lie outside the scope of Article 122. Within the scope of our subject of study, the concept of gift, which gifts are customary and which are uncustomary, the conditions for requesting the return of gifts, the scope of returning the gifts, and the lawsuits that could otherwise be filed will be covered under the title of the return of gifts as a legal consequence of the breaking off an engagement.

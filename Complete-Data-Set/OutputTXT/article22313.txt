Makale Başlığı: Medallions Found on the Ceiling of the Nakhchivan Mumine Hatun Cupola
Özet: The thought, understanding and pleasure seen in pre-Islamic Turkish art also manifested itself after Islam. It is possible to see the reflections of this understanding in all geographies where Turks dominate and live. In Turkish-Islamic art, especially in religious architecture; There is a continuity in the interior and exterior decorations throughout history. It is an expression of the continuity of the Turkish-Islamic understanding of thought, both in architecture and decorations. Nakhchivan architecture and decorations have an important place among the examples spread in the area from Central Asia to Anatolia and the Balkans. Undoubtedly, one of the best examples of Nakhchivan architecture, which played an important role in the transition from Central Asia to Anatolia, is the Mumine Hatun cupola. The medallions on the inner ceiling of the Mümine Hatun Vault, which we examined, had an impact on the Turkish-Islamic works made after them in terms of cosmic and ornamentation.

Özet: The increased use of social media has led to the preference of modern advertising methods, such as social media advertising, rather than traditional advertising methods. Social media advertising is preferred by businesses because it has no time or place restrictions, is effective, and its target audience can be determined.One of the most preferred advertising methods in social media advertising is advertisements made through social media influencers. Social media influencers are social media users with a high number of followers on social media platforms and the ability to influence their audience. The large number of commercials made by social media influencers created the need to legally evaluate these ads.Our study will primarily focus on concepts of advertising, social media and social media influencers. Next, advertisements made through social media influencers will be evaluated in terms of unfair competition regulations.

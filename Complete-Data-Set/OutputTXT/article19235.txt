Makale Başlığı: Color as A “Thing in Itself” in Art: On The Example of Mark Rothko and Dan Flavin
Özet: While color has been dealt with by art historians and critics to evaluate artworks in art history, it has always been the subject of artists as one of the most basic elements they use to make sense of their works. Differences in the meaning of colors in the historical process and different cultures have brought about very different interpretations in the works of artists. Color is used by some artists to express anger, by some to express love, by some to express eternity, by some to express productivity or an inner journey. In this study, research was carried out on the use of color by getting rid of all these psychological references and meanings. The concept of “thing-in-itself” was used to express the use of color only as itself in art, by separating it from all references and meanings. Mark Rothko, one of the main representatives of "Color Field Painting" in the American Abstract Expressionist art, and Dan Flavin, who is in Minimal Art, are taken as examples of the artists who use color as a "mere thing in itself", in other words, with its material existence. Both artists center color; but they use color through different mediums: one with paint, the other with light. What both artists have in common is that the color does not represent anything other than itself in their work. Color is not used to represent anything, they just bring itself into existence. In the works of both artists, color functions with its material presence and as the material that creates the works. The audience interacts with the works through the direct communication that the material existence of color establishes with them.

Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ABUSIVE SUPERVISION, ORGANIZATIONAL HAPPINESS AND JOB PERFORMANCE
Özet: Aim: Employees spend a significant part of their time in organizations. For this reason, it is important to provide a peaceful and happy organizational environment. The aim of this study is to determine the relationships between abusive supervision, job performance and organizational happiness. Method: 274 nurses working in a public hospital constitute the sample of this study. Correlation and regression analyzes were used in the analysis of the data.Findings: In the research, significant relationships were found between abusive supervision, organizational happiness and job performance. It was determined that abusive supervision has a negative effect on organizational happiness and job performance. While organizational happiness directly affects job performance, it has been determined that the "realization of potential" dimension of organizational happiness positively affects job performance. Result: Abusive supervision causes a decrease in organizational happiness and job performance. Providing a work environment where employees can use their potential, improve their skills and abilities, and overcome difficulties will contribute to the increase of business performance. In order to create an effective, productive and peaceful working environment in organizations, abusive behaviors should not be tolerated and employee happiness should be given importance.

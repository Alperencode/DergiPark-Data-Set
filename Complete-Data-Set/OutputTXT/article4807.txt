Makale Başlığı: Holistic Education, Holistic Development, Holistic Person
Özet: The development of the individual is much more than the processing, development and therefore the appreciation of the academic side of the individual, that is, only the left side of the brain. Subjects such as reading, writing, and math are essential, but they are not the only things an individual must learn as s/he grows up, which will help them succeed in life and become both a good person and a good citizen. The philosophy of “holistic teaching, development, holistic person”, which we have been hearing often in recent years but is never a new philosophy, has become a popular and effective way of educating children. So, what is meant by “holistic teaching, development and person” and what does it mean? In this article, this question will be tried to be answered and suggestions will be made to both parents and teachers.

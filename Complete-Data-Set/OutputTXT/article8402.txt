Makale Başlığı: Reading Hülegü’s Invasion of Baghdad through the Point of the View of Iraqi Poet Ma'rûf al-Rusâfi
Özet: Baghdad by the Mongol armies in 1258. As a result of the massacre that lasted for days, the city was destroyed, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, and the libraries were poured into the river, meaning Islamic civilization. The destruction of Baghdad became the subject of the genre known as the city elegy in Arabic literature, and many poets lamented over what happened to the city. One of these poets, the Iraqi poet Ma'rûf al-Rusâfî (d. 1945), dealt with the events in Baghdad in a literary style in his eulogy of about sixty couplets. In the eulogy, historical data about how the occupation took place are depicted in the company of literary arts, on the other hand, it is tried to give messages to Iraq and the Islamic world by referring to the mistakes made. In this study, besides the literary language and style of the poet's ode, the political and social recommendations it contains are examined under two separate headings. According to the poet, there is not much difference in terms of Sunni-Shiite conflict between before 1258, when Baghdad fell silent, and at the beginning of the twentieth century, when the poet witnessed great collapses. The Sunni-Shiite conflict which has been going on for centuries in and around Baghdad and which made Muslims pay a heavy price, such as the destruction of the caliphate and massacres, still continues. In this respect, it can be said that al-Rusâfî's eulogy, while conveying a historical event in a literary style, gives an idea about how certain thoughts can be inculcated to the present and future generations.

Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF CHILD PATIENTS WITH PEPTIC ULCER: A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE
Özet: OBJECTIVE: Data on the incidence of peptic ulcer in childhood and risk factors other than Helicobacter pylori (Hp) are insufficient. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency, clinical findings, risk factors and complications of gastroduodenal ulcer in children.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The endoscopy reports and file information of the children who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy in our center between May 2011 and December 2018 were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Of the 5892 pediatric patients examined, 448 (7.6%) had peptic ulcers. Of the ulcers evaluated, 69% were duodenal, 27.4% were gastric, and 3.6% were both gastric and duodenal ulcers. The most common (52.2%) symptom was dyspepsia. The most common risk factor in peptic ulcers was Hp (66.5%). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were found to be the second most common (5.8%) risk factor. No risk factor could be demonstrated in 14.95% of the cases. Complications secondary to peptic ulcer disease were detected in 70 (15.7%) of the patients. The complications were; bleeding in 50 (12.7%) patients, gastric outlet obstruction in 11 (2.4%) patients, and perforation in 2 (0.4%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori infection is the most important risk factor for peptic ulcer in children. However, in cases where Hp cannot be demonstrated, other risk factors should be investigated.

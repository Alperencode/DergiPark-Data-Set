Makale Başlığı: FUNDING BY E-MONEY and TOKENS (DIGITAL TURKISH COIN): A STUDY ON DIGITAL TURKISH LIRA
Özet: The research deals with the transformation of developing technology into products and services. The subject discussed includes a system proposal regarding the acceptance and use of the Digital Turkish Lira (DTL) that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is preparing to implement. The research was carried out with semi-structured in-depth interview technique, one of the qualitative data analysis methods. 10 academicians who are experts in the field of economics and finance were included. The research sample was carried out with the snowball sampling, since many people did not know about Blockchain and DTL. While the study plans to ensure that companies can borrow with more affordable costs with the integration of DTL into the market in the future, it is aimed to contribute to the Turkish economy by enabling investors to shift their investments to the currency with nominal value behind them rather than the speculative and fragile structures of cryptocurrency and token markets. Among the suggestions of the study, a system specific to the tokens to be issued by the companies, namely the Digital Turkish Coins and the Digital Turkish Coins Exchange, where these coins can be traded, has been proposed. In this context, the study is exploratory research in the field of digital money and is expected to make a modest contribution to the literature with the proposal of a cost-effective system for Digital Turkish Lira (DTL), Digital Turkish Coin (DTC), Digital Turkish Coin Exchange (DTCE) and corporate borrowings in the new period. It is thought that studies in this field will increase as DTL studies are concluded positively and steps are taken towards its use.

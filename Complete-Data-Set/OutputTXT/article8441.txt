Makale Başlığı: Assessment of the Correlation Between Anthropometric Measurements, Mediterranean Diet and Nutritional Habits of Students
Özet: Aim: In the study, the aim was to assess the possible correlation between the Mediterranean diet quality index with anthropometric measurements by identifying the ability of students attending Tekirdağ Namık Kemal University Department of Nutrition and Dietetics to apply academic knowledge related to healthy lifestyles to their own lives and their healthy eating obsessions.Method: The sample for the study comprised a total of 174 students who volunteered to participate, aged between 18-24 years abiding by the study participation criteria, including 54 in the fourth year, 65 in the third year, and 59 in the second year of university. The survey form was applied to students participating in the research with the face-to-face interview method. Additionally, the anthropometric measurements and body composition of students completing the survey form were determined.Results: As a result of these assessments, students had a mean Mediterranean Diet Quality Index of 5.3±2.95 and mean ORTO-11 scale point of 24.75±6.48. The mean body weight of students was 59.7±11.1 kg and mean BMI was 21.72±3.1. In our study, it was determined that as the level of class increased, compliance with the Mediterranean diet increased. It was found that as the Mediterranean diet quality index scores of the students increased, BMI values and the ORTO-11 scale scores decreased (p<0.05).Conclusion: It has been determined that compliance with the Mediterranean diet positively affects the body weight, BMI and body composition of individuals. Moreover, there was a determined positive correlation between the orthorexic behaviors and compliance with the Mediterranean diet.

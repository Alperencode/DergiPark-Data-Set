The data collected via convenience sampling and online survey method. Dark Triad Dirty Dozen (DTDD-T) Scale, Personality Belief Questionnaire-Short Form (PBQ-S), Food Consumption Preferences Form and demographic form was used for handling data.  Analysis revealed negative correlations between age and all dark triad scores besides with paranoid and borderline personality features. Positive correlations were determined among Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and all personality disorders, except an insignificant correlation between Machiavellianism and avoidant personality disorder. Participants with omnivore food preference differed with higher means in terms of psychopathy and with lower scores regarding Machiavellianism and narcissism. Meat consumption associated positively and meat doneness negatively with psychopathy. Regression analysis revealed that %42,3 of the variance of psychopathy was explained by Machievellanism, and Schizoid personality features and, food related preferences as eggs, grains, meat, meat doneness, beside ice-cream, and sweets with milk variables.  Results evaluated according to relevant literature. Since associations between dark triad personality traits, personality disorders and food preferences is a novel and emerging area of study,  it is also obvious that it requires further investigation.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Usage Possibilities of Durum Wheat Flour in Bread Production
Özet: Durum wheat flour (DWF) is a by-product obtained from the production of durum wheat semolina. In this study, DWF was added to the bread formulation in certain levels directly (7.5%, 15% and 22.5%) and as sourdough to provide the same proportions. DWF which is substituted with bread wheat flour in the levels of  7.5%,  15% and  22.5% decreased farinograph water absorption value (p<0.05). Increased amount of DWF decreased the specific volume of bread samples significantly when compared to control bread (0% DWF). The highest crumb hardness (5.25±0,37 N) was observed for the bread containing high amount of DWF (22.5%) as sourdough. Direct addition of DWF into bread formulation increased the crust L* (lightness) value (p<0.05) than the addition as sourdough. The higher crust a* (redness) value was observed for DWF addition as sourdough (p<0.05). The hardness value (N) of both bread types (direct addition of DWF and sourdough with DWF) increased significantly (p<0.05) on other days of storage compared to day 0.

Makale Başlığı: Spontaneous rupture of congenital hydrocephalous: a rare complication
Özet: Hydrocephalous represents a diverse group of conditions that result from impaired circulation and/or absorption of CSF, or in rare circumstances, from increased production of CSF by choroid plexus papilloma. Hydrocephalous could be classified as communicating and non communicating. Hydrocephalous resulting from obstruction within ventricular system is called obstructive or non communicating hydrocephalous whereas that resulting from obliteration of subarachanoid cisterns or malfunction of arachanoid villi is called communicating or non obstructive hydrocephalous. Both forms can be congenital or acquired. The first surgical treatment reported in literature was performed by Hippocrates in 5th century B.C., who punctured the lateral ventricle in a patient with obstructive HC. Several procedures and devices have been developed since then, such as external ventricular drainage, external lumbar drainage, repeated lumbar puncture, Ommaya reservoir insertion, or ventriculosubgaleal diversion, ventriculoperitoneal and ventriculoatrial shunts.In untreated cases, head size may continue to increase. Spontaneous external rupture of hydrocephalous is rare presentation. Very few cases have been reported till date.

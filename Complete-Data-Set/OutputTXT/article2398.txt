Makale Başlığı: Comparison of whole and section otolith methods for age determination of northern pike (Esox lucius)
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to compare different otolith methods for age determination of northern pike inhabiting Ladik and Simenlik Lakes.  The northern pike specimens (Esox lucius L., 1758) were sampled between February 2017-2018.  Total length and weight values of fish were recorded, sagittal otoliths were removed and otolith sections were obtained in the transversal plane.  The whole and section otoliths, which underwent the necessary procedures, were made suitable for age determination and were read by a reader in three repetitions in different time periods.  In order to determine the reliable age determination method, mean age (MA), percent agreement (PA), mean percent error (APE) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated separately for both methods.  The total lengths of Lake Ladik and Lake Simenlik E.lucius individuals ranged from 33,0 cm to 74,0 cm, and 28,5 cm to 58,1 cm, respectively.  Their weights varied between 256,52 g and 2747,22 g, and 158,06 g-1513,64 g, respectively, in Lake Ladik and Lake Simenlik.  When the age distributions are examined, the ages of Lake Ladik individuals were 2-7 in the whole otolith and 3-7 in the section otolith; the ages of Lake Simenlik individuals were between 2-6 in whole and section otoliths.  For Lake Ladik northern pike sampling; the data with the highest percent agreement (81,40), lowest average percent error (2,363) and the coefficient of variation (3,070) were obtained from section otoliths.  In Lake Simenlik, on the other hand, the structure with the highest percent agreement (86,89%), lowest average percent error (1,639) and coefficient of variation (2,129) is the section otoliths.  Considering two different habitats and two different age reading methods, it was determined that the section otolith method is a more reliable age determination method than the whole reading method in determining the age of the species.

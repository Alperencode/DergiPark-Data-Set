Makale Başlığı: The Voyage of Archetypes: A Comparative Study on Achebe’s Things Fall Apart and The Book of Dede Korkut
Özet: With the beginning of mankind’s adventure on earth, each society has created its own social, cultural and religious systems. Although the first human existed in a single part of the world, the journey of mankind has veered to different continents. In this study, it is aimed to show the intercontinental voyage of certain archetypes by focusing on the reflection of Nigerian culture in Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart in comparison to Book of Dede Korkut. While making this cultural study between two separate nations, Igbo and Turkish culture were compared in terms of religious, social, and literary features, regarding the concept of “collective unconscious” by Swiss psychiatrist C. Gustav Jung. As a result of this comparison, it has been observed that the two nations located on different continents have similar cultural characteristics, which validates the voyage of archetypes. Keywords: Archetype, Culture, Achebe, Dede Korkut, Igbo, Turkish

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of monitoring parameters according to the body weight of dogs during ovariohysterectomy
Özet: The presented study was designed to determine changes in monitorization parameters during ovariohysterectomy (OHE). In the study, dogs were divided into three groups according to their body weight: group 1 (G1; n=10) included dogs weighing less than 15 kg, group 2 (G2; n=10) between 15 to 29 kg and group 3 (G3; n=10) included dogs weighing 30 kg and more. Each patient’s heart rate (HFr), respiratory rate (RFr), capillary refill time (CRT) and body temperature (T) were recorded prior to and after anesthetic induction. During surgery, HFr, blood pressure (S/D and mean), RFr, peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2) and T were recorded every 10 minutes and at certain critical points during the operation (incision, reaching the left ovary, removing the left ovary, reaching the right ovary, removing the right ovary, reaching the cervix, placing the transfixation ligature, removal of the uterus and muscle/skin closure). There were no differences between the pre-operative HFr, RFr, CRT and T values of the groups. The shortest time to reach critical points was at G1. HFr was found significantly higher in G1 than the other groups when reaching/removing ovaries critical point. RFr, SPO2 and T parameters did not show any significant difference. There was significances MAP parameter in the 10 minutes interval recordings (P= 0.007). As a result, it was determined that HFr values in smaller dog breeds and MAP values in large and giant dog breeds were higher during OHE. It was concluded that all parameters should be interpreted carefully and in conjunction with each other and no vital parameter should be examined by itself.

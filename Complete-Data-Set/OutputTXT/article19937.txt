Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Physical Problems Encountered in Hotels on Organizational Commitment and Job Satisfaction: A Study on Female Employees
Özet: It is possible to state that female employees are less advantageous than male in business life, especially when considering the existing cultural structures in underdeveloped or developing countries. The fixed or traditional ideas in these cultures, which often do not approach women’s work or promotion very moderately, support this opinion. In the tourism sector, which is a service sector, there are some problems faced by female employees in terms of gender, and these problems can affect the different organizational behaviors of employees. From this point of view, the aim of this research is to determine the effect of physical problems faced by female working in hotels on their organizational commitment and job satisfaction levels. In line with the purpose of the research, data was collected through a survey, and a total of 398 usable questionnaires were obtained from hotels operating in the Fethiye district of Muğla province. Ethics committee approval (17/3, E-50288587-050.01.04-59915) was obtained on 01.12.2021 regarding the data collection and processing. According to the findings obtained from the analysis of the data, strong and negative relationships were found between the physical problems faced by female employees in the workplace and their organizational commitment, and there were significant weak relationships between physical problems and job satisfaction levels.

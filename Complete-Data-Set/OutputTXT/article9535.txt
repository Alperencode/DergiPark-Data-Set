Makale Başlığı: PROJECT PLANNING WITH CPM AND PERT METHODS: EXAMPLE OF DEFENCE INDUSTRY
Özet: Project management is the process of planning activities in the project, estimating time and cost, assigning resources, making schedules, and performing controls. Project planning methods are used in project management to make time estimations. CPM, PERT, Gantt Charts, Fuzzy CPM, Fuzzy PERT are project planning methods. The CPM method is used when the activity durations are known certainly. However, in a project implemented for the first time, the duration of activity cannot be estimated certainly. In order to take this variability into account, the PERT method, which calculates the optimistic, probable and pessimistic durations of the activities, is used. Defense industry projects are of great importance as they are related to the defense of the country. In order for defense industry projects to be successful, the projects must be planned effectively. In this study, the planning process of a project realized for the first time by a company serving in the defense industry was examined. In the study, first of all, the activities of the project, their previous activites and duration are defined. In the study, the completion time of the project was calculated using CPM and PERT methods and the results were compared. In the last part of the study, the completion time of the project was calculated under different probabilities by using the PERT method.

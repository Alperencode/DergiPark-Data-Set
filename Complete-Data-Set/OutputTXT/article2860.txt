Makale Başlığı: Reflections of University Preferences: A Study on Information Management Programs
Özet: As a result of the Higher Education Institutions Exam, which approximately 2.5 million students take in recent years, the majority of the candidates are not able to get into any program. It is also debatable if the programs really preferred by the students, who qualified to study any program in the universities. Although there is a general acceptance that the majority cannot enter the program they wish to study, it is considered that the issue, which has too many stakeholders and interested parties, has not been adequately examined. In this study, the university entrance exam performances and preferences of students in information management programs are examined through the data shared by the higher education system with the public. Data such as the occupancy rates, the number of faculty members, and the preference tendencies of the candidates of the information management programs are presented by years or by comparing the findings of some previous studies. The results of the study revealed that there are potential dangers that await the information management programs. Foremost danger is the risk that these programs may turn into programs that are not preferred by the candidates. It is clear that the respective parties should act quickly and realistically about the future of the programs. In this context, it is suggested that this multidimensional issue should be handled on the basis of quantitative findings, supported by qualitative data, and action should be taken according to the results reached by consensus.

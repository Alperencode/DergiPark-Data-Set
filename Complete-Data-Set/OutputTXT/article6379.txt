Makale Başlığı: DETERMINATION OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL, ANTIOXIDANT, TEXTURAL AND SENSORY FEATURES OF PASTIRMA CEMEN PASTE PRODUCED BY USING DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF BLACK GARLIC
Özet: This study aims were to evaluate the effects of using different concentrations (10%, 15%, 20%) of black garlic (BG) as an alternative to fresh garlic on the physicochemical, antioxidant, textural and sensory properties of pastırma cemen paste (CP), and to determine the most appropriate amount of BG in terms of consumer acceptance and bioactive properties. The addition of BG at increasing concentration decreased the moisture, pH, colour (L*, a*, and b*), firmness and stickiness values of the CP compared to the control with fresh garlic. While the total phenolics and antioxidant activity of CP increased with the addition of BG, the highest values were in having 20% BG-added group. On the other hand, considering the parameters of odour, taste, spreadability and general appreciation, the 15% BG-added group was the most appreciated. As a result, 15% BG can be used as an alternative to fresh garlic to increase CP's sensory acceptability and bioactive properties.

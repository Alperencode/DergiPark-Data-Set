Makale Başlığı: Mehdîlik ve Nüzûl-i Îsâ Tartışmaları -İslam’ın Klasik Çağında Eskatolojik Kurtarıcı İnancı-
Özet: The resurrection of Jesus is among the most controversial issues. In addition, whether Jesus' coming to the world would be accepted as a sign of the apocalypse was also examined under the heading Nüzûl-i Îsâ. Even in most of the sources, the return of Jesus to the world was conveyed as one of the signs of the great apocalypse. İt can be said that this work which we will introduce is a resource that should be used in understanding the historical course of the discussions on the subject.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Electrical Parameters in Traction Transformers by Finite Element Method
Özet: Traction transformers feed the motor drivers used in electric locomotives in railway systems. Traction transformers are placed in a limited area above or below the locomotives. Due to the power needs of the equipment used in train systems, there are many winding structures at different voltage levels in traction transformers. Therefore, the design parameters of traction transformers should be specifically evaluated for providing a high level of sustainability, efficiency, and operational safety in railway systems. It is crucial to carry out detailed analyses during the design phase and evaluate them according to standards. Accurate calculation of critical electrical parameters such as short circuit impedance, inrush currents, tank losses and core losses in traction transformers is not always possible or very laborious with theoretical methods. In this case, the finite element analysis method has many advantages. With finite element analysis, calculations can be made with high accuracy and in a short time. This study calculated the electrical parameters of a sample traction transformer with Ansys Electronics Suite finite element analysis software. Summary information about the calculated parameters is given, and the analysis steps are explained. In this context, the necessity of the finite element method for the electrical analysis of traction transformers, which is one of the most critical components in railway systems, has been expressed.

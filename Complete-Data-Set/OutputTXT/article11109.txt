Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Factors associated with Peer Bullying and Self-Acceptance in Nursing Students
Özet: This study was conducted to examine the relationship between peer bullying-related factors and self-acceptance in nursing students. The sample of this descriptive study consisted of 405 students studying their education in the nursing departments of two universities. The data were collected between April-June 2020 using the Introductory Characteristics Form, the Peer Bullying Scale for University Students, and the Unconditional Self-Acceptance Scale. Descriptive statistics, Independent Sample t-test, One-Way Analysis of Variance, Tukey test, and Pearson Correlation coefficient were used in the analysis of the data. A negative significant correlation was found between the mean score of the Unconditional Self-Acceptance sub-dimension and the total score of the Peer Bullying Scale for University Students, and the mean scores of the Ideological Bullying, Isolation, and Sexual Bullying sub-dimensions. While there was a negative correlation between Cyber Bullying sub-dimension and the total score of the Unconditional Self-Acceptance Scale, a positive and significant relationship was found with the Conditional Self-Acceptance sub-dimension. As a result, relationships established with peers have great importance for university students who are in the emerging adulthood period. Being exposed to bullying by peers can lead to significant problems in the physical, mental, social, academic, and professional development of university students.

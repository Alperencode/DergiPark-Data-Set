Makale Başlığı: THE ENIGMA OF ARRIVAL: A STORY OF BELONGING TO SOMEWHERE
Özet: This paper aims to analyze the novel The Enigma of Arrival by V. S. Naipaul as a story of making sense of place. The novel is a mixture of autobiography and fiction. Thus, the protagonist is Naipaul, the writer, and the novel recounts the protagonist’s attempt to become a writer. The protagonist moves to England to study English literature as he thinks that his native land, Trinidad is in decay and does not have valuable material to write about. However, he is disappointed with England because he cannot find England as he expects. Instead of finding grand buildings described in the novels of Dickens and Thackeray, he finds that England is in decay like his country. As a result, he feels displaced and depressed in England. In order to overcome these feelings, he travels for years in England and he realizes that not only himself as an ex-colonized living in ex-colonizer Britain but also English people feel displaced in their country. Then, he rents a cottage in a city in England named Salisbury where he observes that places and people are not in decay but in a constant change, and in flux. He learns to adapt England as a candidate to be his home and integrates himself into its culture without rejecting his own culture.

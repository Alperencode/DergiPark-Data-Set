Makale Başlığı: Effect of Sequential Ejaculation with Short Abstinence Time on Sperm Chromatin Integrity and Antioxidant Activity
Özet: The effects of semen parameters on embryology laboratory results and clinical success vary according to the preferred treatment approach in assisted reproductive technology. Semen parameters vary according to the duration of abstinence and the washing protocols applied in the andrology laboratory and effect the quality of the sperm material to be inseminated. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a short abstinence period on routine semen parameters, sperm chromatin, DNA integrity, and antioxidant capacity against oxidative stress in normozoospermic men. Samples taken from the same patient after 2-5 days of abstinence with consecutive ejaculation (n=36) and after 1 hour of abstinence (n=36) were evaluated before and after washing. It was found that sperm volume and total motile sperm count were significantly decreased in the short abstinence group before washing. It was observed that motility did not change between the groups after washing, and the concentration decreased significantly in the short abstinence group. It was determined that sperm chromatin damage and DNA fragmentation rate decreased when the abstinence period was kept short, and there was no change in antioxidant capacity. As a result, in normozoospermic cases, keeping the abstinence period short will decrease sperm concentration and total progressive motile sperm count and allow the use of higher quality sperm in terms of chromatin and DNA integrity in insemination compared to the assisted approach reproductive treatment. Sequential ejaculation and shortening of the abstinence time do not have a positive or negative effect on the antioxidant capacity.

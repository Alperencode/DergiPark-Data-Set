Makale Başlığı: A Stylistic Analysis of Lawrence Durrell’s Famous Novel, 'Clea'
Özet: In recent years, stylistics studies have gained upmost importance especially within the realm of literary criticism. When modern approaches to the definition of “style” are analyzed, it is apparent that there is a tendency to refuse the idea that “style” is just a decoration. In other words, it is claimed that style is not something that stays outside the content and embellishes it, but it is inside the writing and complements the content in a certain way. Therefore, stylistics studies aim not only to define formal features of texts, but also to show their functional effect for the interpretation of the text. For this purpose, this study provides a comprehensive stylistic analysis of Lawrence Durrell’s novel, Clea, and questions how the stylistic elements the author uses affect the representation of the content in the novel. In order to identify various elements that constitute Durrell’s distinctive style, a detailed linguistic analysis was carried out. To this end, a linguistic methodology was applied, and the novel was discussed on lexical, syntactic and semantic levels. One of the motives of this linguistic analysis was to familiarize researhers (e.g. translators) with the stylistic features that are important in the interpretation and recreation of the content of the novel. After foregrounding the various stylistic devices that the author resorted to, their functions in the representation of the content were evaluated. As a result of the detailed analysis, it was seen that the stylistic elements contributed to the interpretation and representation of the content in different aspects.

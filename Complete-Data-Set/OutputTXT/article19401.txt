Makale Başlığı: ALTERNATIVE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES OF CURCUMINOIDS FROM TURMERIC
Özet: Curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin have recently beenthe focus of attention on food science due to their growing popularity amonghealth-conscious consumers. Traditionally, curcumin has been used as a colorant,a sweetener, and a food preservative. Natural plants contain various bioactivecomponents such as lipids, phytochemicals, compounds used in pharmacology,flavors, odors, and pigments, so extracts of these plants are often used inindustries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetics. Some traditional andmechanical processes are used to achieve maximum benefit in the commercialuse of these high-cost compounds. Alternative techniques are used to overcomethe disadvantages of traditional extraction methods. These techniques have beendeveloped to overcome these disadvantages and, most importantly, maintain the integrity of the compounds and achieve an environmentally friendly processDeveloped as an alternative to traditional methods to extract chemicals from plantsources, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), accelerated solvent extraction(ASE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), subcritical water extraction (SWE),microwave assisted extraction and enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) methods,such as fast, effective, and relatively environmentally friendly compared to theorganic solvents used are considered.

Makale Başlığı: Izmir’s Legacy for Future Generations, the Final Situation of Ödemiş Silks and Tire Beledi Weavings
Özet: İzmir and its districts hold various heritages that will continue into the future with their deep-rooted history with different cultural values. In the region, which has an old weaving tradition, Ödemiş silk weavings and Tire Beledi weavings are discussed in this article, and the current production activities are evaluated with the developments from past to present. Weaving activities continue with the efforts of a limited number of enterprises and weaving masters in the district, where weavings such as Ödemiş linen, handkerchiefs, crepe, idare cloth, pembezar, and loincloth, which are among the local weavings of Ödemiş, are now produced only by order. Tire Beledi weaving, on the other hand, is examined in a more specific context, within the framework of weaver training problems and current production activities, which occurred as a result of the death of the weaving master Saim Bayri. In this study, the condition of traditional fabrics in both traditional and innovative techniques and new usage areas are questioned in the light of the data obtained through field research including visits to manufacturers, local markets and museums and interviews with resource persons. In the conclusion, topics such as that of transferring these fabrics and skills to future generations and ensuring their sustainability, expanding their use in new areas, protecting production techniques, increasing the certificates of weavers and weaving masters are evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Democracy and Environmental Degradation: Panel Data Analysis on E-20 Countries
Özet: Environmental degradation occurs as an important problem that makes its impact felt day by day and affects all of humanity. Increased carbon emissions threaten human life and environmental sustainability. Factors such as industrialization, deforestation, unconscious and excessive use of resources increase environmental degradation. It is envisaged that environmental degradation will be combated in a democratic management approach where strong institutional structures, good governance and freedom of association exist. A democratic system in which freedom of information is established will also increase the environmental awareness of individuals. Increasing environmental awareness will increase environmental quality and reduce environmental degradation. It is aimed in this study to look into the relationship between democracy and environmental degradation. In accordance with the stated purpose, panel data analysis was carried out using data covering the period 2006-2019 in the E-20 countries. The Democracy Index published by The Economist was used as an indicator of democracy, while carbon emissions (metric tons per capita) were used as an indicator of environmental degradation. In addition, control variables such as GDP per capita, foreign direct investments, the share of the urban population in the total population and the ratio of trade openness were included in the study. It has been found as a result of the analysis that environmental degradation decreases as the level of democratization increases in the E-20 countries.

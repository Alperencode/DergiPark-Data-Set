Makale Başlığı: A NEW ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE PERSPECTIVE: AN AUTOPOIETIC APPROACH TO ORGANIZATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOPOIESIS SCALE FOR SCHOOL
Özet: This study is aimed at making a conceptual analysis of the autopoietic approach, which emphasizes organizational change based on the understanding of creating itself by preserving its original identity and by reproducing itself, and to develop a measurement tool for autopoietic change in educational organizations. The research has been conducted on a study group consisting of 250 teachers working in primary, secondary and high schools. The Autopoiesis Scale developed in the research consists of two subscales. The first subscale is "Adopting Autopoiesis Understanding Approach Scale", the second subscale is "Autopoiesis Approach Scale in Schools”. Exploratory factor analysis has been conducted separately for the content and construct validity of the two subscales, and then the results have been subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. As a result of the analyses, it has been determined that the Autopoietic Scale, which consists of two sub-scales, is a valid and reliable measurement tool that can measure the level of teachers' adoption of the autopoietic approach in schools and the current level of autopoietic change in schools.

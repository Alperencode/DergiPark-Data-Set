Makale Başlığı: Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Positive and Negative Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia in Intensive Care Unit
Özet: Aim: We aimed to compare RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR negative patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in terms of outcome and laboratory results in the inflammation process.Material / Method: Patients who were admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and had typical COVID-19 pneumonia findings on thorax tomography were included in the study. Patients were grouped as RT-PCR negative and RT-PCR positive. Groups were compared for descriptive and laboratory characteristics, treatments, length of stay and outcome.Results: Lactate, D-dimer levels, and leukocyte, neutrophil counts of the RT-PCR positive group were lower than the other group (p<0.05). Ferritin and CRP values were higher in the RT-PCR positive group (p<0.01). The duration between symptom onset and admission to ICU was longer in the PCR-positive group(p=0.016). PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 193.58±60.26 in RT-PCR negative group, and 111.16±58.51 in RT-PCR positive group (p=0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of length of stay, respiratory therapies or outcome (p>0.05). Conclusion: We may say that RT-PCR negative and RT-PCR positive patients were in different inflammation period in admission. We concluded that there was no difference between groups in terms of outcome.

Makale Başlığı: Teaching and Learning Centers for Faculty Professional Development in Türkiye:  Administrative and Organizational Structure
Özet: Globalization and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic have disrupted the way we live, work, and learn, which has resulted in an inevitable digital shift and transformation in education. In addition to the need for lifelong learning, continuous self-improvement, and renewing knowledge, the current digital transformation requires academics to apply their pedagogical and technological skills on their teaching and learning to address the newly-emerging needs. This study aims to determine the demographics, administrative and organizational structures, and the activities of Teaching and Learning Centers that strive to contribute to the professional development of faculty members in Turkish higher education institutions. The data from the centers were collected in a three-step process and analyzed qualitatively. The findings revealed that most of the centers, other than the pioneer ones, were recently established and were affiliated with and supported by university senior management, where the center administrators undertake most of the workload. Therefore, ensuring faculty members' participation in professional development activities organized by these centers is important to increase their awareness of using technology as a tool in teaching.

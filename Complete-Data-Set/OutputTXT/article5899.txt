Makale Başlığı: The Answers in Qur’an Against Negative Beliefs and Behaviors
Özet: While Qur’an contains information about a number of words and actions from theopponents of Islam, it is also observed that they are rejected afterwards. These wordsand actions, which are known to be coming from People of the Book, the polytheists, thehypocrites and the Satan, can be evaluated under the 3 main headings of Tawhid, Prophethoodand the Hereafter. What is meant by Tawhid is to believe in the titles of Allah suchas his unity, omnipotence and creativity. Prophethood means revelation based guidanceto help people to gain happiness both in the world and the Hereafter; and what is meantby Hereafter is for people to believe in the day of Judgement, resurrection after death,being rewarded or punished after being accounted for what they did in the world. Of thosementioned, some oppose either Tawhid or Prophethood, and some oppose the Hereafter.Moreover, it is also observed within the Qur’an that judgmental answers are provided tosome of the actions of some of the prophets. Hereby, this article will cover the words andactions that the Qur’an does not consider appropriate, as well as the answers provided forthem by Qur’an.

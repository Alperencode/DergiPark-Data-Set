Makale Başlığı: A study of the pupal development of Calliphoravomitoria (L., 1758)(Calliphoridae: Diptera) at different temperatures
Özet: In  this  study,  the  pupal  development  process  of  the  Calliphora  vomitoria  (L.  1758),  widely  used  in  the  estimation  of  postmortem time in forensic entomology, was examined. In the last decade, studies of the development periods in the pupal stage and the development times of these periods have increased around the world and specifically in Turkey. In this study, the aim was to detect the pupal development periods of the Calliphora vomitoria via a process of hourly pupal dissection, a process that would be the only one of its kind in the literature for this species. This method was repeated under three different temperatures. Adult emergence from the pupae was observed at hours 501–504, 312–314, and 208–210 at 15 °C, 20°C, and 25 °C, respectively. Nine new development periods, not specified in other studies, were detected with this study, thus producing new attained results for our country and the science world.

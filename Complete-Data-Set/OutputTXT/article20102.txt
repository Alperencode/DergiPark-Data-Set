Makale Başlığı: PROPHET MUHAMMAD’S GUIDANCE TO THE COMPANIONS IN PROBLEM BETWEEN SPOUSES
Özet: Along with different and challenging issues Prophet Muhammad was also a guide, arbitrator and mediator for the believers in the problems experienced between spouses. Some problems between spouses among the Companions had been reaching the Prophet through different ways and for different reasons. In this period, the problems between spouses were mostly based on divorce matters, matters originating from Jahiliyyah habits or practices (e.g. zıhar, ilâ) and matters related to violence. After these issues there came problems like stinginess, not spending time with the spouse, seeing the spouse as inadequate and disliking the temperament of the spouse. The examples of the guidance of the Messenger of Allah on this issue have found wide coverage in hadith sources. The attitudes and behaviors of the Prophet regarding the solution of various problems experienced between spouses constitute an extremely important example for people living in every period and society. Identifying principles from the guidance of our Prophet in this regard is among the main objectives of this research. Knowing and implementing these principles will play an important role in protecting the family and providing a peaceful environment in today's societies where divorce and domestic violence are widespread.In this study, the narrations about the problems between spouses are discussed, and evaluations for the determination of solution-providing principles are introduced.

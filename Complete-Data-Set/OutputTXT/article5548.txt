Makale Başlığı: Preventing of bread mould spoilage and reducing the use of calcium propionate in bread by using antifungal lactic acid bacteria
Özet: In this study; 8 lactic acid bacteria with antifungal activity and suitable for sourdough production were used in sourdough bread production to determine the effect of  bread on prolonging shelf life and to compare with calcium propionate used as a chemical preservative in the food industry/bakery. For this, Weissella cibaria 908, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides 2619, Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis 2709, Levilactobacillus brevis 2216Y, and L. plantarum subsp. plantarum Y201 isolates were chosen for bread production by paying attention to changes in total acidity and pH values, blistering volumes, organic acid production profiles in bread dough. Total 9 different types of bread were produced. Among them at the end of the study, it was observed that the shelf life of bread containing selected antifungal lactic acid bacteria mixed culture (1:1:1:1:1) and 0.15% calcium propionate was prolonged compared to commercially available breads where 0.3% calcium propionate is allowed. Thus, the use of calcium propionate can be reduced by half. It was observed that there was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the commercially sold and the produced sourdough bread in terms of general admissibility and it was concluded that it can be used in sourdough bread production.

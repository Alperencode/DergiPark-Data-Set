In this study, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 orthopedically disabled individuals who experienced the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a qualitative research method phenomenological pattern for the changes in the perception of disaster and the changes in their daily lives of the COVID-19 pandemic, and their views on disaster perception and COVID-19 experiences were analyzed. As a result of the research, solutions are offered for the problems experienced by orthopedically disabled people.

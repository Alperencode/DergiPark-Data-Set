Makale Başlığı: Turkish Higher Education Law 2547 and the Representation of the Higher Education Board in the Press (1980–1981)
Özet: In order for universities, which play a key role in the education systems, to adapt to the changing world, some innovations are needed in higher education. Since the first university was established, many different laws have been enacted to regulate the higher education system in Turkey. Each new law or regulation introduced brought along controversies with it, and even caused some social conflicts. Although the Higher Education Law 2547 and the Higher Education Council, which was established on November 6, 1981, are defined as an effort to reform and improve higher education, no consensus is observed among different social segments as to whether it has actually brought an effective regulation or not. This study aims to reveal how the Higher Education Law No. 2547, which has brought great debates since 1981, when it came into force in Turkey, was represented in the press of the period. Thus, the news published in Milliyet, Hürriyet, Tercüman and Cumhuriyet newspapers between 1980 and 1981 were analyzed. The analysis of the news revealed that the new higher education law was discussed by focusing on the administrative and scientific autonomy of universities, problems related to the centralized governance structure, the change and effects of the university admission exam regulations, and the problems faced by university faculty members.

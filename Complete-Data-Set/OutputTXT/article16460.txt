Makale Başlığı: WHEN BORDERS BLURRED: A SAMPLE OF DEMARCATION PROCESS OF THE COMMON FORESTS IN THE LATE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Özet: In 16 January 1905 the village headman of the Kaymarofça (Priştine) and two members of the village councile wrote a petition to Inspectorship of Rumeli Province on behalf of village people, and lodged a complaint with neighbouring villagers of Kraçiçe (Prezrin) along of their encroachment to the village coppice. This was an usual plaint at first blush, however the actual situation was more complex for the case was intervened two different offices: the courts and local councils. In such a context, I propose that to whom belongs village forests and how their borders define in case of controversy constituted main tensions between neighbouring villages. In this paper, on the basis of a conflict story, I will first discuss the problem of jurisdictional question in the Ottoman Empire concerning village forests. Secondly, I will scrutinize the process of trial and demarcation, by focusing on their actors, methods and potential outcomes.

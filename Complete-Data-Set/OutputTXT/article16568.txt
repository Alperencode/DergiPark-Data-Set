Makale Başlığı: THE ISLAMIC LITERATURE ISSUE: LOOKING AT THE PROGRESS OF A LITERATURE DISCUSSION IN LİTERARY JOURNALS BETWEEN 1960-2000
Özet: In the history of Turkish literature, a debate has started in the context of the understanding of "Islamic literature" since the 1960s. Although this discussion does not take place in the history of literature, it is important in terms of showing the literary discourses and literary environment of a period. The understanding of Islamic literature, which is formed by the sensitivities of Islam and the ideology of Islamism, is a discussion on the content of the literary work and the way the subject is handled. The rich publishing activities, journalism studies and translation movement, which started as a result of the partially liberal structure of the 1961 Constitution, prepared the birth of this literary understanding among the Islamic sections. In addition, the political, social and socio-cultural developments of this period are among the other important reasons that influenced the birth of this literary understanding. In the 1970s and 1980s, various opinions were expressed among the Islamist section in Turkey, based on the need to define and classify a literary understanding under the name of Islamic literature. This discussion has been developed with many questions such as whether there can be a religiously defined literary understanding, what will constitute the source of this literary understanding, and what will be the subject and how it will be handled in literary works. The course of the debate, which was carried out in the 1970s and 1980s with articles and investigations published in magazines such as Büyük Doğu, Diriliş, Edebiyat, Mavera, and in Islamist publications such as the Suffe Kültür Sanat Yıllığı, continued until the 2000s.In this study, the discussion of Islamic literature, which started in the 1960s around periodicals, diversified in the 1970s, evaluated in the aesthetic context since the 1980s, and the reasons that prepared the birth of this debate and the views expressed around the concept will be discussed.

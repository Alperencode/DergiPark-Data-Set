Makale Başlığı: AN ECOCRITICAL APPROACH TO YŌKO TAWADA’S DYSTOPIAN NOVEL “THE LAST CHILDREN OF TOKYO”
Özet: After the Great East Japan Earthquake and the aftermath of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Yōko Tawada has written many works that touch the issues surrounding earthquakes and natural disasters - she raises salient questions through the power of literature. The novel The Last Children of Tokyo, which will be examined in this study, is a dystopian novel written by Yōko Tawada after her trip to the disaster zone of Fukushima. The novel presents a society which was impacted by ecological disasters and environmental problems - a life of drifting into dystopia, taking place in the capital city of Tokyo the center of Japan’s industry and economy. Tawada's novel leads us to a confrontation with today's human questions; on environmental problems, the danger of nuclear radiation, and the relationship of nuclear power plants to civilization. In this regard, Tawada's text was analyzed through the concept of “deep ecology" that emerged in the field of ecocriticism. The term “deep ecology” was first used by the philosopher Arne Naess in his 1973 article titled, Deep Ecology Movement: Some Philosophical Aspects. Explaining the basic principles of deep ecology into eight items, Naess provides a defense for the richness and diversity of life forms and states that human and non-human beings are values in themselves. The Last Children of Tokyo, emphasizing the value of not only human but also non-human beings, defending the equality of all beings and depicting all beings as part of the web of life has shown that it is compatible with the basic principles of Naess's philosophy of deep ecology

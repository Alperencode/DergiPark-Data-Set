Makale Başlığı: Ikhtisar Tradition in Arabic Grammar (Nahw): The Case of Taftazani’s al-Irshad
Özet: In addition to creating short and concise information in a certain discipline, to abridge a voluminous book is called ikhtisar. Mukhtasar (abridged) books have been composed in various disiplines in classical Islam. They are mostly written to eliminate the difficulties a certain book or to facilitate memorization. The nahw (Arabic grammar) is no exception in respect of producing mukhtasar books. One of the scholars who wrote a mukhtasar books on nahw was Mas‘ud Omer at-Taftazani (d. 792/1390). Taftazani is a versatile scholar who produced many works in the fields of tafsir, kalam, fiqh, jurisprudence, logic, Arabic language and literature. However his books on nahw is not widely known compared to his works on other disiplines. One of his remarkable works in the field of nahw is al-Irshad. Taftazani wrote this work for his son Muhammad in 778 (1376). This article studies Taftazani’s mukhtasar work al-Irshad. It is argued by some scholars that al-Irshad is an abridgment of Ibn al-Hajib’s al-Kafiyah. After scrutinising the claim it has been argued that there is no convincing evidence of relations between al-Kafiyah and al-Irshad. It is established that Taftazani’s al-Irshad is an original mukhtasar book on nahw.

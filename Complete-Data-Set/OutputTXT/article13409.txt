Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE BALANCE AND LIFE QUALITY OF VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN: A PILOT STUDY
Özet: The aim of the study is to examine the balance and quality of life of visually impaired children. Eight visually impaired and 10 children with normal vision aged 8-12 years were included in the study. The age and degrees of vision loss of the children were recorded, and anthropometric measurements were made. The balance of children was evaluated by using "Balance Error Scoring System". Their quality of life was evaluated using the “Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0” for 8-12-year-olds. Both groups’ assessments were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The statistical significance level was accepted as 0.05 in all tests. The age and anthropometric characteristics of children in both groups were similar (p>0.05). It was found that standing on one leg on a hard/flat floor, to tally hard floor, to tally soft floor, and to tally balance error scores were higher in visually impaired children (p=0.003; p=0.016; p=0.001; p=0.002 respectively). No difference was found in the quality of life assessment of children (p>0.05). On the parental scales, visually impaired children were found to have lower physical health functionality and total paren talassessment scores (p=0.003; p=0.001, respectively). Balance development in visually impaired children may be delayed or progress differently compared to their typically developing peers. The effect of visual information on balance was mostly seen in the ability to stand on one foot on soft ground. This is thought to be related to the fact that dynamic balances skills are more difficult for visually impaired children than static balance kills.

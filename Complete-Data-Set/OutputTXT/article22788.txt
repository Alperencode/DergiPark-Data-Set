Makale Başlığı: A case of Listeria monocytogenes Meningitis Complicated with Acute Hydrocephalus in an Immunosuppressed Patient
Özet: Listeria monocytogenes meningitis is seen in elderly or immunosuppressed patients and may cause high mortality. Hydrocephalus is a serious complication of Listeria monocytogenes meningoencephalitis. Inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy and the development of hydrocephalus are the main independent prognostic factors associated with mortality. L.monocytogenes may be a causative agent of meningitis and bacteremia, especially in immunosuppressed patients. It may cause acute hydrocephalus and should be considered because of its high mortality risk. The presented case is a 58-year-old female patient, who was using steroids, with a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, and was admitted to the hospital with blurred consciousness and fever for two days. She was diagnosed with meningitis due to L. monocytogenes, which was complicated by acute hydrocephalus. The patient died on the 21st day of intensive care follow-up and the 16th day of mechanical ventilator support.L.monocytogenes may be a causative agent of meningitis and bacteremia, especially in immunosuppressive patients. Listeria should be kept in mind in elderly or immunosuppressed patients, and effective empirical treatments for Listeria should be started. Acute hydrocephalus should be kept in mind in patients with clinical worsening despite treatment.

Makale Başlığı: ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF SAMBUCUS EBULUS L.
Özet: Objective: Sambucus L. genus of Adoxaceae (Elderberry) family was investigated in previous studies for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial activities. Moreover, previous in vivo and in vitro studies performed on the leaves showed that the plant possesses anti-inflammatory activity. Our study aims to investigate the in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of the stem, fruit and leaf extracts of Sambucus ebulus L. plant. Material and Method: The antioxidant activity was evaluated in a biological assay using Sambucus ebulus, whereas the radical scavenging activity was measured using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ABTS methods.Result and Discussion: The maximum anti-inflammatory effect was observed in stem extracts followed by leaf and fruit extracts, respectively. Stem extracts exhibited the highest ABTS and DPPH free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) similar to the results of anti-inflammatory activity. As a conclusion, stem extracts were the most potent extracts among the others regarding the FRSA and anti-inflammatory activities.In our study, the biological activity potential of the extracts was demonstrated, thus providing data supporting the traditional use of Sambucus ebulus L.

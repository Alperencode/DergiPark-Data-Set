Makale Başlığı: The comparison of some important agronomic and quality characteristics of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) varieties grown as a main and double crop
Özet: This study was conducted at the experimental area of the Department of Field Crops, Faculty of Agriculture, Cukurova University as a main and double crop in 2018 and 2019. The objective of this study was to determine and compare of important agronomic and quality characteristics of sesame varieties grown in main and double crop growing condition. The experiment design was a split blok with three replications. 17 different sesame varieties were used as a plant material in this research. Plant height, the first capsule height, branch and capsule number per plant, 1000 seed weight, seed yield per decare, oil and protein content characteristics were investigated. The differences between the sesame varieties for the investigated characteristics were significant in both growing seasons. The data belonging to agronomic characteristics of the sesame varieties were found higher in main crop than in double crop growing season. Because, total temperature, day length and growing period were the higher in main crop than in double crop growing season. Specially, seed yield values were found 40% higher in main crop than in double crop. According to two-year results, the data belonging to Muganlı-57, Sarı Susam and Osmangazi-99 varieties for the seed yield, morphological and quality properties were higher than the others varieties in both growing seasons.

Makale Başlığı: Teachers’ Fidelity of Use of Selected Senior High School Subject Curricula
Özet: The study examined how faithfully senior high school teachers implemented selected senior high school subject curricula. Cross sectional survey design was used in the study.  Using the level of use dimension of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), 111 senior high school teachers were randomly selected from the pool of accounting, business management, economics, geography and social studies teachers in the Central Region. Questionnaires were administered to the respondents and retrieved within 3 weeks. Data generated were analysed using frequencies and percentages. Results showed that senior high school teachers teaching accounting, business management, economics, geography and social studies in the Region failed to use the official curriculum in teaching. Accordingly, it is recommended that Ghana Education Service should politically engage teachers to willfully accept and use the curriculum instead of strengthening instructional supervision to ensure that teachers implement the official curriculum.

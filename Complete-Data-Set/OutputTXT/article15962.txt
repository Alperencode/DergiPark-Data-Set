Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of bee pollen from different botanical sources with elemental analysis
Özet: Bee pollen contains many nutrients, including minerals. Elements are minor substances of bee pollen, they play a crucial role in identifying its quality. As a food supplement, concentrations of essential macro and microelements, and harmful trace elements have to be verified to determine its quality and safety. This study aimed to identify the element contents of bee pollens from different botanic sources. Firstly, we applied melissopalynological analysis to find the botanical origins of bee pollen samples. Then, it was determined the concentrations of 13 elements in the samples. Element concentration was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Potassium (K) occurred at the highest concentrations in samples (8666.67-9623.33), followed by magnesium (Mg) (808.08-672.08), sodium (Na) (263.00-349.67), calcium (Ca) (261.33-294), iron (Fe) (96.00-110), Zn (33.77-57.00), Manganese (Mn) (20.15-33.85), Copper (Cu) (5.27-9.60), Nickel (Ni) (1.13-2.48), Chromium (Cr) (1.95-2.20), Selenium (Se) (0.72-1.03) and Cobalt (Co) (0-008) respectively as mg kg-1. Target hazard quotients (THQ), hazard index (HI), and recommended daily allowance (RDA) values were calculated with these results. Considering the THQ values, it was determined that the consumption of bee pollen was safe for adults, but not suitable for consumption by children. At the same time it was concluded from this study that bee pollen can be a good mineral source in terms of essential elements, K, Mg, Se, Mn, Na, Ca, Fe, Cu., and Cr

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Psychometric Properties of the Ethnocentrism Scale
Özet: Ethnocentrism  is  the  evaluation  of  different  cultures  in  various  societies  according to the preconceptions of one’s own culture and with one’s own culture at the center. It has some distinct features compared to tourism, since one of the main motivations of  tourism is to know different cultures. The purpose of this study was to adapt “the ethnocentrism scale,” which was  developed  by  Neuliep  and  McCroskey,  into  Turkish  and  to  test  the  validity  and  reliability  analysis  of  the  scale.  The  study  was  conducted  through   a   self-administered   questionnaire   and   distributed   to   422   residents  of  Alaçatı,  Izmir  (Turkiye).  As  a  result  of  Robust  Diagonally  Weighted  Least  Squares  (RDWLS)  analysis,  it  was  concluded  that  the  adapted  ethnocentrism  scale  was  three-dimensional  rather  than  one-dimensional as in its original structure. None of the items were excluded from the study. Results showed that scale is valid and reliable with some limitations for the Turkish version. The ethnocentrism scale was found in the literature for the first time in three dimensions, and the names of the dimensions were determined for the first time in this study.

Makale Başlığı: A case report of vulvar lipoma
Özet: A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of adipose tissue and it is considered as the most common form of soft tissue tumor. Lipomas are soft on palpation, usually movable, and are generally painless. They are widely disseminated benign mesenchymal neoplasms commonly found over the nape of the neck and upper back, shoulders, abdomen, buttocks, and proximal portions of the extremities. Their occurrence in the vulva is said to be so rare that only a few cases have been reported. This case describes a patient; 47 years old who had admitted to our clinic with complaint of vulvar mass localized on labium majus approximately 1 year. Total excision of the mass was made and the pathological examination result was lipoma. Vulvar lipoma occurs in rare and should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of the other vulvar masses.

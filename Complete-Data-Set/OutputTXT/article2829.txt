Makale Başlığı: Tübitak 2237-A Evaluation of Statistical Modeling Methods and Applications Training in Natural Sciences
Özet: Today, the complexity of raw data and information traffic as a result of technological and scientific developments has made the analysis and interpretation of data even more important. Therefore, statistical methods and tools are needed more in curricula. Classical methods such as multiple and logistic regression analysis are generally used in modeling the suitability of target species to the habitat, productivity/species diversity in ecological studies, and natural events such as earthquakes, landslides, and floods in geological studies. However, especially in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of rule-based, empirical, and probabilistic-based methods in studies in natural sciences. In this study, the benefits of statistical modeling techniques and software in natural sciences and the benefits of the "Statistical Modeling Techniques and Applications in Natural Sciences" project carried out within the scope of TÜBİTAK BIDEB 2237-A Scientific Education Activities Support Program are emphasized.The sample of the research consists of 90 graduate students enrolled in graduate programs participating in the activities. Within the scope of the project, activities in which the application examples of statistics in natural sciences were transferred with statistical software were carried out. Activity evaluation forms created by the project researchers were used to measure the impact of these activities on the participating students. It was observed that the transfer of statistical modeling analyzes and application examples from R and Python-based natural sciences in the project affected the participants positively and increased their desire for learning and research.

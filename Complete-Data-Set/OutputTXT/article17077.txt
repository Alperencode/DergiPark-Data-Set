Makale Başlığı: A Passive Marker in South Azerbaijani Turkic: -mAK ol-
Özet: -mAK ol- structure in South Azerbaijan Turkic is essentially a passivity marker. There are both positive and negative conjugations of the structure in the verb + -mAK ol-  sequence. In this structure; -(y)(A)r, -(y)(X)r ~ -(y)(X)rI / -mAz ~ -mAs, -mXr ~ -mXrI aorist and present tense suffixes, which are mostly used to present non-focal and always continuous events, are included. In -mAK ol-  structured sentences, there are usually maxims, rules, general acceptances, traditions, prohibitions, etc. judgments are reported. In these sentences, besides passivity, the meanings of adequacy, inadequacy and necessity modality are also conveyed according to the context.Declaring passivity with the -mAK ol- structure is also found in Turkey Turkish. Between the two language areas, there are features that unite and differ in terms of usage limits and functions of the structure in question. In Turkey Turkish, -Ar ~ -Xr ~ -r / -mAz aorist tense suffixes are usually added after the -mAK ol- structure. However, in Turkey Turkish, -mAK ol- structure is used after both positive and negative verbs. When negatively conjugated -mAK ol- structure is added to the positive verb, a passive-negative verb emerges; when it is added to a negative verb, a passive-positive verb emerges. In Turkey Turkish, -mAK ol- structured passivity and necessity modality are also presented.

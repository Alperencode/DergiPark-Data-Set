The reasons for not making teacher empowerment by school principals were determined as personal, administrative, financial, and limited authority reasons. What the Ministry of National Education should do for teacher empowerment was revealed. They should adopt policies that support personal development and teacher autonomy, increase the authority of school principals, and make changes in the legislation.

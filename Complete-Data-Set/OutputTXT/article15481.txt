Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of The Effect of Using Devices Emitting Blue Light On The Total Sleep Duration of 1-3-Year-Old Children
Özet: Objective: This study was descriptively and relationally performed to determine the factors associated with blue light exposure in children aged 1 to 3 years and their total sleep duration. Methods: A total of 323 mothers with children aged 1 to 3 years were included in the study. As a data collection tool, a questionnaire was used to evaluate sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to blue light, and total sleep time, which was prepared for mothers of children aged 1-3. Results: A statistically significant difference was found (p<0.05) between the total duration of sleep and the child having his/her bed, presence of a tablet belonging to the child, presence of a blue-light-emitting electronic device, and a blue-light-emitting illuminator in the child’s room, whether the mother allows her child to use a smartphone and whether the child uses a blue-light-emitting electronic device in the dark right before going to sleep. Based on the multiple regression analysis results, Sociodemographic variables have affected sleep duration at a rate of 6.6% in Model 1 and 16.5% in Model 2, in which characteristics related to the use of blue-light-emitting devices were also added. Conclusion: The usage of the blue-light-emitting device is becoming an increasingly significant public health problem, and effective measures should be taken and implemented to prevent this problem from worsening.

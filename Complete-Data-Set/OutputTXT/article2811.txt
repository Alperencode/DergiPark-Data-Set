Makale Başlığı: Effect of Microplastics on Marine Environment and Aquatic Organisms
Özet: In this review study, the effect of microplastic pollution, which is considered as one of the serious environmental problems today and in the future, on marine and marine ecosystems is discussed in a holistic way. In the literature search, primary and secondary microplastics has been observed which are mixed with the marine environment by wastewater treatment plant discharge and river transport, therefore, many marine organism are ingested microplastics and negatively affect living things due to reproductive disorders, fake satiety and injury. In addition, depending on the raw material from which the plastics are obtained, it is possible to transport different toxic compounds to the marine environment. In the extensive literature research, it has been understood that primary and secondary microplastics, which are mixed with the marine environment by wastewater treatment plant discharge and river transport, can be swallowed by living things and negatively affect living things due to reproductive disorders, false satiety and injury. In addition, depending on the raw material from which the plastics are obtained, it is possible to transport different toxic compounds to the marine environment. The results of the study showed that in parallel with the particles detected in the seas, microplastics with similar properties were found in all living groups living in these environments. Particles detected in different structures and organs of other creatures, including protected corals and mammals, revealed that microplastics have spread throughout the entire marine ecosystem. The most common types of microplastics in the examinations are polypropylene and polyethylene polymers and fiber-shaped particles. In addition to the most common blue colored plastic particles, it was concluded that microplastics, which are evaluated as light-colored in the color scale such as white, transparent, and cream, are also quite common in the aquatic environment.

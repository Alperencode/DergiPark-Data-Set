Makale Başlığı: THE CONCEPT OF ORGAN UNDER TURKISH AND SWISS JOINT STOCK COMPANY LAW
Özet: Joint stock companies, having legal personalities provided under Article 125 of the Turkish Commercial Code, acquire their legal capacity once their organs are legally established and express their will through their organs in accordance with Article 50/1 Turkish Civil Code (Article 55/1 of the Swiss Civil Code). Representation of the legal entity by the organ, which makes a part of such legal entity, is not based on a representation relationship in the sense of the law of obligations, but on a relationship that stems from the law and the authority attributed to the capacity of organ. Since legal transactions carried out by the organs on behalf of the legal entity as well as unlawful acts committed by them during the performance of their duties bind the legal entity under Article 50/2 of the TCC (Art. 55/2 of the CC), it is noteworthy to clarify the scope of the concept of organ in terms of liability law in joint stock companies. 	As the concept of organ is broadly interpreted under Turkish and Swiss Law, the scope of the concept includes not only de jure organs (organe formel) established based on law, articles of association or internal company regulations such as internal directive but also person(s) acting as an organ despite not being authorized under such a regulation. In other words, persons performing management and representation functions reserved to organs, irrespective as to whether they have been formally appointed to do so, via participating in the formation of the company’s will, independently and under their own responsibility are defined as de facto organs (organe de fait). In addition, under Swiss doctrine and case law of the Swiss Federal Court, it is asserted that capacity of organ can be acquired based on external conditions pursuant to theory of trust and such concept is called as apparent organ (Organstellung durch/İnfolge Kundgabe/organe apparent). While this concept has been widely accepted among the Swiss scholars, binding effect of the transactions and actions performed by such organ remains still controversary.

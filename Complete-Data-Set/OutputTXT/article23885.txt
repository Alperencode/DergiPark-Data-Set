Makale Başlığı: A Comparison of Fas-Fas Ligand Mediated Apoptosis with Clinical and Pathological Parameters in Larynx Cancers; Twenty Years After Laryngectomy
Özet: Objective: Larynx cancer constitutes 2% of all cancers in adults with 96% of larynx malignancies being squamous cell carcinoma (SHC). Apoptosis is a cell death mechanism that is quite different from necrosis. It is also known as programmed cell death, physiological cell death, or cell suicide. Physiological mediators that activate programmed cell death (apoptosis) are Fas and Fas Ligand (FasL).Materials  and  Methods:  In  a  thesis  study  conducted  by  our  authors  in  2004,  we  investigated  the  relationship  of  Fas-Fas  ligand-mediated  apoptosis  with  survival  in  laryngeal  cancer,  prognostic  factors  (age,  localization,  histological  grade,  tumor  size,  lymph,  blood  vessel  invasion),  stage, and inflammatory response of the tumor. In this study, we investigated the relationship between survival and death rates after 20 years and Fas-FasL.Results:  When  FAS  was  evaluated  20  years  later,  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  found  between  mortality  rates  depending  on  stage  (p=0.023;  p<0.05).  While  the  survival  rate  is  higher  in  stage  1  cases,  the  rate  of  death  is  higher  in  stage  3  cases.  No  statistically  significant  difference was found between mortality rates according to stages for FAS Ligand 20 years later (p>0.05).Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that the Fas/Fas-L system was not associated with clinical parameters in laryngeal cancers in our short-term follow-up. However, when we repeated our follow-up 20 years later, we found that Fas system deficiency, although not in FAS Ligand, adversely affected survival in the long term in laryngeal cancer patients.

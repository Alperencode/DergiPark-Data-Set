Makale Başlığı: Sub-Lethal Effects of Heavy Metals Toxicity on Pathological Lesions of Sea Bream
Özet: Histopathological indices have been largely used as biomarkers in the monitoring of fish health status during exposure to heavy metals, both in the experimental and environmental studies. The aims of the present study was to provide baseline data on the prevalence of histopathological liver lesions in marine fishes (case study of liver histopathology at mercury exposure) under experimental mercury exposure and to compare the sampling areas in terms of the types and prevalence of lesions present, for monitoring purposes. Experimental study was at seawater re-circulatory tanks. Mercury concentrations were determined using a standard cold vapor atomic absorption. Histopathological analyses were done in tissue processor and the slides were stained with haematoxylin and counter stained with eosin. There were many liver lesions in both area include enlarged and lateral nuclei, nuclear degeneration and vacuolation; oncotic, apoptic, focal, massive, centrilobular and periportal necrosis; atrophy, lipidosis, hydropic and cloudy swelling, oval cell proliferation; bile stagnation, dilation of sinusoid, intracellular edema and dark granules. In conclusion the present investigation indicated that mercury is a toxic substance in seabream and the sub-lethal mercury concentrations tested may cause several changes in the histological indices of the studied fish and we can use these changes as biomarkers of mercury detection.

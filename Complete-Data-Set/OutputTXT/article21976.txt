Makale Başlığı: MEDICAL ACTIVITIES DURING THE BAHRÎ MEMLÛKS PERIOD (1250-1382)
Özet: One of the most important issues in human life is health. Like every great civilization, Islam was also very closely interested in the field of health. Health and the protection of health, which are accepted as the precondition of worship in Islam, have been intensively studied since the early ages of Islam. The first origin of Islamic medicine was the Qur'an and hadith. Ancient Greek and Hellenistic medicine became the source of this field, with the Islamic State reaching ancient inscriptions. Since the Mamluks were relatively stronger than other contemporary states, they excelled in scientific activities. Political power put the Mamluks over the top, especially in medical activities. In our article, information is given about the medical activities in the Bahri Mamluk period.

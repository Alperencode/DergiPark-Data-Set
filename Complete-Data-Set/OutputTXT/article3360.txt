Makale Başlığı: Case Report: Motor and Sensory Development of a Case Followed with Suspicion of Neonatal Thiamine Metabolism Dysfunction Syndrome
Özet: The aim of this study was to follow early motor and sensory development of the infant with Thiamine Metabolism Dysfunction Syndrome (TMDS). Newborn with 38 weeks gestational age, 2600 kilograms weight admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to respiratory distress, absence of suction reflex, and floppy appearance. Case had respiratory support during 5 weeks. Infant was referred to SANKO UniversityPhysiotherapy unit on postterm 12th week due to hypotonia after discharge. Prechtl’s General Movements (GMs) and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Evaluation (HINE) was performed at 3rd and 4th months. Sensory processing parameters were evaluated with the Newborn Sensory Profile-2 (NSP-2). Case had no Fidgety movements (FMs). The HINE score was 37-45 in the 3th and 4th month respectively. Total scorein NSP-2 was 33 in the 3rd month (general = 12, auditory = 7, visual = 8, tactile = 2, movement = 2, oral sensory processing = 1). While the case’s Newborn Sensory Profile-2 (NSP-2) total score was in newborn norms, visual, tactile, movement but oral sensory parameters and auditory parameters were in low limits. The low motor performance was associated with low NSP-2 score and showed interaction with motor-sensory development. It is concluded that early physiotherapy program can be effective.

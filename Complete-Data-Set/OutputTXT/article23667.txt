Makale Başlığı: Current Treatment Approaches and Nursing Care in the Management of Diabetic Neuropathy
Özet: Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common neurological complications of diabetes with a high risk of morbidity that affects the quality of life of individuals. Many people with diabetes do not report symptoms or problems associated with diabetic neuropathy. All patients with diabetes should be screened annually for neuropathy with a neuropathy-specific history, screening test, and physical examination. These individuals are at high risk for poor quality of life, neuropathic pain, falls, development of foot ulcers and infections, and amputation. In order to minimize complications and improve quality of life, early diagnosis of individuals with diabetic neuropathy, evaluation with valid and reliable screening tools, and management of diabetic neuropathy are important. Management of diabetic neuropathy requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Nurses, who are an important member of this team, are among the responsibilities of nurses to raise awareness of individuals with diabetic neuropathy and those at risk of developing neuropathy, to plan interventions for high-risk groups, and to ensure that they gain correct knowledge and behavior. The nurse's awareness and knowledge about the screening, diagnosis, treatment and care practices of individuals with diabetic neuropathy will be beneficial in preventing or reducing the development of negative outcomes.Keywords: Diabetic neuropathy; scanning; treatment; care; nursing.

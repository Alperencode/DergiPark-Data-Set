Makale Başlığı: An Analysis on the Comparison of the Performance and Configuration Features of Big Data Tools Solr and Elasticsearch
Özet: Today, every kind of text, audio and visual data, which are thought tobe transformed into pieces of information, are stored for long periods of timefor processing. The concept of Bid Data is not only associated with the data stored,but also with the system involving hardware and software that collects,processes, stores, and analyzes the data. As the data grows bigger, theirphysical storage options must be provided in a distributed architecture. Solrand Elasticsearch are among the most preferred tools which makes this storageprocess easier. As a part of Apache Lucene project, Solr is a software whichwas started to be developed in 2004 with the searching features of full text,multiple search, dynamic clustering, database-integrated, open source andelasticity. Similarly, Elasticsearch is a new open-source tool for real-time,full-text and distributed search, which was launched in 2010 using the Lucenelibrary. Although Solr and Elasticsearch have similar features, there are manyparameters that differentiates one from the other such as intended use, type ofuse, and query and indexing performances. This study researches and analyzesthe differences between Solr and Elasticsearch with regards to their query andindexing speeds, ease and difficulties of use, configuration forms, andarchitectures in light of the literature, and the results are discussedregarding these tools’ performances.

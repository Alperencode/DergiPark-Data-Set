Makale Başlığı: Syrian Children Living in Turkey at The Intersection of Victimization, Social Cohesion and The Right to Education: Analysis of National News
Özet: After the civil war that started in 2011 in Syria, Syrians who came to Turkey in masses have been the source of debates and polarizations in the social and political arena. Considering the power of the mass media in the construction of social problems, revealing how Syrian children are framed in the media is extremely important in terms of understanding the perception and interpretation of the people. The aim of this study is to reveal how Syrian children are framed in the news in Sabah and Sözcü newspapers. For this purpose, news about Syrian immigrant children in two newspapers which considered to be in mainstream media and dissident media, Sabah and Sözcü were analyzed.  Since the news frames are not visible at first glance in the text, qualitative and quantitative content analysis techniques were used to determine these frames. As a result of the examination of newspaper news and related literature, five themes were identified: Integration and social acceptance, Support and protection, Tragedy, Security issues and Immigration policies. After determining the themes and categories, four news frameworks including these themes and categories were determined by making use of the literature: (1) Solution framework, (2) Aid and empowerment framework, (3) Victimization framework, and (4) Policy framework. In the analyzed news, children were frequently featured in the news on education-related issues. Education of children as a fundamental right; It constitutes the most basic interpretation framework, both in terms of their adaptation to society and the support activities carried out in this regard, and in the context of solving the problems they experience.

Makale Başlığı: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE PHILOSOPHY AND THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE PROBLEM OF HUDÛS
Özet: In this article, one of the ancient issues of Islamic thought, the problematic of hudûs, is discussed. In this context, the ideas and arguments of Muslim philosophers, who advocate the intrinsic hudûs of the world, and theologians, who prioritize temporal hudûs, have been examined with a comparative method. In our study, first of all, the philosophical-theological framework of the concepts such as essence, object, individual essence and attribute, which constitute the elements of the universe, is shed light on. To understand the problem of hudûs on a sufficiently correct basis, first of all, requires an intellectual analysis of the mentioned terms. Secondly, by examining the philosophical theses about the intrinsic hudûs, the basic points of the philosophers were analyzed. Finally, it has been analyzed on which basic principles the theologians built the temporal hudûs doctrine. In our research, a critical and analytical method has been followed and attention has been drawn to the different meanings attributed to concepts such as hudûs, seniority and ibda.

The concept of theatricality in the 20th century spreads to many areas of social sciences such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, which tend to understand modern individuals, their conditions and experiences. In Selçuk Baran's stories, because of the incompatibility of the characters with the society and their social roles, the alienation and isolation brought about by this; the characters’ everyday life leads them to see the nature of life as a theatrical spectacle, an edited, fictionalized performance.

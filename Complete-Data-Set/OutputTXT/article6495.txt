Özet: The subject of this research is the life and ascetic poems of Abu Ishaq al-Ilbiri, who spent most of his life in the period of Mülukü't-tawaif, one of the breaking periods of Andalusian political history. Abu Ishaq al-Ilbiri had a great contribution in the development of Andalusian ascetic poetry and making it an independent art. al-Ilbiri has been accepted by literary historians as one of the greatest authorities in writing ascetic odes in Arabic literature. al-Ilbiri, who has an ascetic personality, is a scholar in the field of fiqh and hadith, and he also took on different duties in the Andalusian administrative organization. Although there are poems on various subjects such as piety, elegy, praise meth, self-praise, and satire in al-Ilbiri's divan, he is mostly known by the literary circles for his piety-themed poems. The finiteness of worldly life, old age, death, self-condemnation, regret for sins, repentance, hoping for the mercy of Allah, taking lessons from the graves and past nations, the life of the hereafter, taqwa, encouraging worship and knowledge have been constituted the most mentioned issues in al-Ilbiri's ascetic poems.

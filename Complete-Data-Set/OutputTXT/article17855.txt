Makale Başlığı: Effect of Compost and Vermicompost Applied with Different NPK Doses on Growth and Mineral Nutrition of Wheat
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to examine the effects of compost and vermicompost applied with different NPK doses on the growth and mineral nutrition of wheat. Study was planned according to randomized parcels experimental design and conducted as a pot experiment with three replications under greenhouse condition. Two dosages (0 and 1.5 t/da) of compost and vermicompost and three dosages of NPK (NPK0, NPK1: 150, 100, 100 mg/kg ve NPK2: 300, 200, 200 mg/kg) were used in the experiment. Looking at the results obtained, it was seen that compost and vermicompost had similar effects and their application alone did not have a significant effect on the parameters examined. On the other hand, applications of both compost materials together with NPK, positively affected the mineral nutrition of the plant. While it was seen that the most effective applications on the growth and mineral nutrition of wheat were NPK applications, organic fertilizer applications without chemical fertilizer did not have a positive contribution on the growth and mineral nutrition of wheat.

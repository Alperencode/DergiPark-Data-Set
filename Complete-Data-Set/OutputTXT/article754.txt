Makale Başlığı: The impact of the Turkish border on controlling power lines to Europe
Özet: Abstract: In the light of the increasing demand for energy, in particular natural gas, which has become, more than before, a goal for many countries of the world, which made them put its sources, transit routes and access costs at the forefront of their priorities. Among those countries is Turkey, which suffered a lot from the weakness of its energy sources, which affected its regional and national relations Accordingly, Turkey has sought over the past years to own drilling ships and exploit its strategic location, political stability and relations with producing countries in order to achieve sufficiency and play an important role in transferring energy to Europe, which will increase its regional and international weight. Turkey has made several agreements which allow  energy lines to pass through its lands, achieving its goals concerning energy, the most important of which is finding alternatives to Russian gas, raising its political influence on the global scene, increasing the income for its treasury and improving its service reality, and at the same time obstructing any pipeline that does not benefit its interests in the light of its historical conflict with Cyprus and competition with other countries. Moreover, Turkey's gas discoveries in Tuna Well-1 in 2020 had a great impact on its overall activities. But we find Russia, which is the most important exporter of gas to Europe, has done and is doing the impossible in order to strengthen this role, which provides it with an important economy and influence on the European arena, which brought it to fight wars, including the wars of Georgia and Ukraine, and also Syria to prevent the Qatari-Turkish pipeline through its territory. At the same time we find the American attitude, which supports everything that would reduce dependency on on Middle Eastern oil and Russian gas in particular, which makes it support the Qatari-Turkish line. In the process of this competition, we find that Russia prefers the Iranian gas to the Qatari one  because it's cheaper. Russia, also,   considers Iran the closest to it. By examining the details of those lines and their positions, we find how Turkey has turned into an impo111111rtant centre in the transfer of energy and how it works to benefit from this in all aspects of life, whether internal or external, including its international relations.

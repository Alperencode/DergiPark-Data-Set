Makale Başlığı: Impact of COVID-19 “Stay at home!” Restrictions on the Prevalence of Deep Vein Thrombosis in the Geriatric Population: A Retrospective Controlled Study
Özet: Objective: The restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period may have caused an increase in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the elderly population. We aimed to evaluate whether the frequency of DVT increased in the geriatric population due to the restrictions of COVID-19 pandemic period and to emphasize the importance of exercise in this population.Materials and Methods: Patients over the age of 65 who applied to our hospital, who underwent lower extremity venous doppler ultrasonography in the last year before the pandemic and in the first year with pandemic restrictions, were retrospectively analyzed from the database. The records of a total of 1531 patients were scanned. Patients with DVT were recorded.Results: Forty-nine DVT cases in the last year before the pandemic, and 53 DVT cases in the first year of the restrictions were detected. The incidence of DVT in the elderly was found to be higher in the restrictions period.Conclusion: Although the “Stay at home!” restrictions reduced the rate of spread of the disease, it may also have prepared the ground for serious conditions such as DVT in this population. Home exercise programs are important especially for the elderly population during the pandemic period.

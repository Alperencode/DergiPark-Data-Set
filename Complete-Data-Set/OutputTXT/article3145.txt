Makale Başlığı: The Situations of Syrian Refugees Journalists in the Host Societies and Asylum Countries
Özet: With the continuation of the war, the bombing in my country, Syria, and the displacement crises that the Syrians have been subjected for ten years, these bad conditions directly reflected on the Syrian journalists, who in turn were forced to flee Syria to save their lives. Therefore, the article aimed to identify the conditions and situation of the Syrian refugees’ journalists who are scattered and present in the host communities in which they reside or the countries of asylum to which they were displaced, by using the questionnaire form and distributing it to a purposive sample of Syrian refugee journalists residing in the countries of asylum in Turkey, Germany, France and a number of other countries, the number of the respondents were (20) journalists, (11) males and (9) females. And the results refer that most Syrian journalists are unwilling to return to Syria, especially in light of the insecurity and lack of basic life necessities there, in addition to the presence of other challenges related to racism and hatred by some members of the host community and the difficulty of finding job opportunities or even pay for home renting or medical treatment.

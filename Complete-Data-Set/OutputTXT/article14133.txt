Makale Başlığı: REFLECTIONS OF QUALITY, QUANTITY, AREA AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO THE STATE OF CONSERVATION IN URBAN CULTURAL HERITAGE AREAS AND PRESERVATION PROBLEMS
Özet: This retrospective study was conducted to determine threats to urban cultural heritage sites on World Heritage List and threats' effects on the conservation status. Seven sites were included between 1979-2018 with criteria i, ii, iii, iv or more, as urban-themed in the cultural category. Statements of OUV, Reactive Monitoring Tools and UNESCO World Heritage Committee Decisions of the sites have been evaluated. Findings indicate that 144 States Parties have prepared 3627 reports for 566 areas; In the categorical evaluation, it was determined that 385 (68%) cultural, 153 (27%) natural and 28 (5%) mixed sites. Another remarkable finding is that only 2 of the 14 threat titles have social content. Of these, five threats, which are sub-headings of management and institutional factors, are among the top ten list, although the rates vary by region, starting with 58% and reaching 84%. It is noteworthy that heritage sites, which started conservation studies early and carried out systematically, effectively managed the threat factors. The primary way to protect sites from threat factors; is to develop the management system in line with threats.

Serum 25-OH D level <20 ng / ml was accepted as severe insufficiency, 20-30 ng / ml insufficiency, 30-100 ng / ml proficiency,> 100 toxicity. The data were evaluated by the SPSS 22.00 program. One-way Anova test was used in the evaluation of the data. p<0.05 was considered significant.Results: In our study, 17,673 (74.34%) women and 6,100 (25.66%) men were included. The mean vitamin D levels of the patients (16.60 ± 10.83 ng / mL) were in women (16.51 ± 11.04 ng / mL) and in men (16.88 ± 10.19 ng / mL). When the mean vitamin D levels were compared to investigate the seasonal changes in vitamin D deficiency, it was statistically significant in both male and female patients among age groups.Conclusion: In our study, severe vitamin D deficiency was found in patients admitted to our hospital.

Makale Başlığı: Faculty Members’ Perceptions of their Academic Titles and Job Stress
Özet: This study aims to determine the relationship between faculty members’ perceptions of their academic titles and job stress, and the variables affecting their perceptions. Designed as a survey, the quantitative method was used in the study. The research sample consisted of faculty members working at ten public universities. The data were collected via two scales named “Scale of Academic Title Perception” and “Scale of Academics’ Job Stress”. The obtained data were analyzed by frequency and percentage values, t-test, ANOVA, correlation and regression analysis. A significant difference was found in terms of faculty members’ titles and subject areas and perceptions of the faculty members were differentiated by components of the Scale of Academic Title Perception. Likewise, there was a significant difference between faculty members’ perceptions regarding their job stress levels and their academic titles, seniorities and genders. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the academic title perceptions of the faculty members and their levels of job stress. The results indicate that the faculty members’ perceptions of academic titles and the components of the titles are a significant predictor of the level of job stress and there is a significant negative correlation between them. Some suggestions are made to take measures that will positively affect the academic title perceptions of faculty members and reduce their job stress.

Makale Başlığı: Note on the  convergence of fractional conformable diffusion equation  with linear source term
Özet: In this paper, we study the diffusion equation with conformable derivative. The main goal is to prove the convergence of the mild solution to our problem when the order of fractional Laplacian tends to $1^-$. The principal techniques of our paper is based on some useful evaluations for exponential kernels.

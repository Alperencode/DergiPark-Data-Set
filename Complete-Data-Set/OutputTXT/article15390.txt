Makale Başlığı: Fuel Properties of Sandbox (Hura crepitans Linn.) Methyl Ester and its Blends
Özet: Fuel properties of Sandbox Methyl Ester (SBME) blends were experimentally determined. Pure SBME designated B100 was blended with diesel at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50% volume designated B5, B10, B15, B20, B25 and B50 respectively. The fuel properties were determined according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) was used as a reference fuel. Fuel properties of the SBME were modified with the addition of diesel percentage in the blend from B100-B5: the density ranged from                                   891-865 kg m-3. The specific gravity ranged from 0.87-0.82. The kinematic viscosity ranged from 5.8-4.0 mm2 s-1. The flash and fire point decreased from 160-90°C and 230-140°C, while the cloud and pour points ranged from 4.6-3.4°C and -5.8-(-9.2)°C respectively. The heating value ranged from                                        40.50-41.45 MJ kg-1. The Cetane number for the SBME was 46.71. The saponification value ranged from                                               200-143 mgKOH g-1. The acid value varied from                                    2.7-2.2 mgKOH g-1, while the FFA content varied from                         1.33-1.10 mg g-1. The Iodine value was in the range of                              108-94 gI2 100g-1. The pH value varied from 6.80-5.60. The carbon content increased from 80.02-85.62 wt%, while the ash content increased from 0.01-0.16 g 100g-1. In comparison to the (AGO) and the ASTM standards, SBME was found to possessed good flow, ignition and combustion characteristics to power diesel engines.

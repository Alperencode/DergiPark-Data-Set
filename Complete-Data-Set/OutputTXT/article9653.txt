Teaching and learning in an e-learning environment is said to happen differently as opposed to the traditional classroom and this can present new challenges to instructors and learners. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to review the various ways of addressing virtual challenges in higher institutions of learningMethods: Literature Search of databases of Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS and ResearchGate using the keywords “Addressing virtual learning challenges” was done. Additional inputs were taken from blogs and relevant reports.Result: The results varied; some learners reported that "It's difficult to share our points as online discussions can move swiftly from one topic to another. Engaging a big class in a live forum can be challenging too." Other learners asserted that by regulating who can speak up at one time, the moderator can ensure that no one is left behind. However, it is also reported that there is a growing concern of plagiarism surrounding online examination and thus stringent plagiarism checks must be enhanced to curtail such vice.Conclusion: A lot is still needed to address virtual learning challenges. No single measure is exhaustive enough and more vigilance is required to sustain the adopted measures and improve the quality of virtual learning.

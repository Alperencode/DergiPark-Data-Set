Makale Başlığı: Influence of Voxel Size on Evaluation of Trabecular Bone Microstructure on Human Mandibles: A CBCT study
Özet: Purpose: This study aims to assess the effect of voxel size on trabecular microstructural evaluation onhuman cadaver mandiblesusing cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.Methods: Twenty two Volumes of Interest were obtained from to human cadaver mandibles which were scanned in three different voxel sizes using CBCT. Scanning performed in 0.125 mm (Group 1), 0.2 mm (Group 2) and 0.3 mm (Group 3) voxel sizes. Regions of interest are calculated in both mandibles for both voxel sizes which are adjusted from apical third of all interdental alveolar trabecular bone from anterior and posterior mandible. Trabecular thickness (Tb. Th); trabecular separation (Tb. Sp); Bone Volume/Total Volume (BV/TV) values were obtained using plug in BoneJ of the software ImageJ. The results were evaluated statistically in software IBM SPSS Statistics 21. Results: Trabecular thickness and trabecular separation showed significant difference between first and the third and the second and the third groups (p=0.000), while first and second group did not. BV/TV values showed no significant difference between whole groups. Conclusion: Beside microstructural analysis is not their first purpose CBCT images carry knowledge about trabecular bone microstructure could be a valuable bone quality assessment tool. High correlation between values with  0.125 mm and 0.2 mm and  low correlation between values with 0.125 mm and 0.3 mm voxel sizes suggest that; this knowledge is clinically more valuable when voxel size is 0.2 mm or thinner.

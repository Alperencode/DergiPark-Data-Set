A 67 year old female patientadmitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath. A right sided mass on the chestwall and thyroid nodules were detected. PTC was diagnosed and the patientunderwent a total thyroidectomy. pT3N0 were evaluated postoperatively. PET-CTdemonstrated the mass at right hemithorax (12 cm lesion, SUV max=7.2) plusneedle biopsy showed a metastasis of PTC. A chest wall resection plus rightupper lobectomy and lymph node dissection was performed as the first choice for PTC metastasis.

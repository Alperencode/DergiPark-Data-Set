Makale Başlığı: QUALIFIED FORMS OF THREAT CRIME IN THE TURKISH PENAL CODE
Özet: In our article, we will look at the serious cases of the offence of threat as regulated in Article 106 of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC). The basic form of the offence of threat is defined in the first sentence of Article 106/1 of TPC. Accordingly, the act of threat is penalized by stipulating "...any person who threatens another individual by stating that he will attack the individual’s, or his relative’s, life or physical or sexual immunity..." With the basic form of the offence of threat, verbal or written attacks against values relating to the right to live, physical or sexual immunity are penalized. And the second sentence of Article 106/1 of TPC defines the cases which extenuate the penalty in the offence of threat. Accordingly, the offence of threat is regulated as a case requiring a lesser penalty compared to its basic form by stipulating "Where the threat relates to causing extensive loss of economic assets or other related harms…" In the section on the cases which extenuate the penalty, we will elaborate the concepts of extensive loss of economic assets or other related harms. With "the other related harms", it is also intended to penalize the verbal attacks against the values remaining outside the legal values protected with the basic form of the offence of threat. And the aggravating circumstances of the offence of threat are regulated in Article 106/2 of TPC across four items. In our study, we will first cover the offence of threat as defined and regulated in TPC and then analyze the cases which extenuate and aggravate the penalty.

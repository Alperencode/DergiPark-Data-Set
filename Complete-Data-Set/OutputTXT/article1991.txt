Makale Başlığı: The Socio-Economic Aspects of the Hat Revolution: The Hat Import, Local Production and Their Impacts on People
Özet: The Hat Revolution has been the subject of many studies, but it has been neglected from an economic point of view. From this point of view, in this study, the socio-economic aspects of the revolution will be discussed in the light of rich economic data. The demand for hats was considerably supplied by import. The hats were mostly imported from Italy and France. The Foreign Trade Statistics indicate that the share of hats which replaced fez imports, in total imports, decreased to a very low level in a few years. Rather, it was observed that the local production replaced import in the supply of hats gradually. The impacts of the Great Depression of 1929 and The Customs Tariff Law on the hat imports were limited. The hat did not impose a serious burden on the economy of the state. But, in fact, cost of living index, civil servant salaries and hat prices data show that the public bore the main burden. Taking this situation into account, the government gave the civil servants an advance on hats on condition that they be paid back one year later. The economic conditions of the period did not allow such an appropriation to be issued to the public.

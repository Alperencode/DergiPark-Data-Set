Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS OF SUPPRESSION APPLICATIONS ON SUMMER ASPHODEL (Asphodelus aestivus Brot.) DENSITY, BOTANICAL COMPOSITION, FORAGE YIELD AND QUALITY OF AEGEAN RANGELANDS
Özet: Summer asphodel (Asphodelus aestivus Brot.) has an underground storage organ that enables the plant tosurvive extreme conditions and contains alkaloids that are toxic to the livestock in rangelands. For this reason,the experiment was carried out in the rangeland of Aydin province (Turkey) in order to determine the mosteffective methods of weed management where there is an increase in the summer asphodel (Asphodelus aestivusBrot.) population. In the study, the effects of 8 different control methods (control, mowing, fertilization,paraquat, glyphosate, 2,4-D, 2,4-D + Picloram, grubbing) on yield, quality and botanical composition wereinvestigated. Result of the findings in this study shows that the grasses increased more in vegetation. The highestvalues of hay yield were observed in paraquat and fertilization applications. High values of crude protein yieldwere found in fertilization and grubbing applications. The lowest population of summer asphodel (Asphodelusaestivus Brot.) was obtained grubbing and paraquat applications. Together with these results, grubbing,fertilization, paraquat and glyphosate applications come to the fore. However, due to the high workforce, it issignificant to choose an application considering the size of the rangeland and the population of the indicatorweed species.

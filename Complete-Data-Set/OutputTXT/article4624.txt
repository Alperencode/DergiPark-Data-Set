Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of the Subsections of Undergraduate Placement Examination of English (LYS-5)
Özet: Language is so generative and continuously evolving that defining what is meant by language and how to assess it are real challenges. In essence, developing an understanding of language ability and the nature of language can enlighten language assessment. The reason is that any test of language proficiency seemingly depends on how test developers define and describe the language construct. In the last two decades, the importance attached to high-stakes exams of English has risen because the results of these exams are used while making decisions regarding a test taker’s university or school admission. The aim of this study is to investigate the subsections of undergraduate placement examination of English (LYS-5) in Turkey by describing the form of the items in the test and what they are actually measuring (e.g. multiple-choice items of reading comprehension, translation, vocabulary, grammar, and etc.) and whether the multiple-choice translation items in the test are as good as open-ended translation items. The results of the exploratory factor analyses and the rotated component matrix indicated that vocabulary and grammar are all shared by those three abilities (factors) measured by the test, which could be grammar-related, vocabulary-related, and overall-ability. Besides, multiple-choice translation scores did not correlate with the scores of the open-ended translation test. The paper suggests that test developers need to study and focus more on high-stakes language exams like LYS-5 so that better and high-quality tests can be developed.

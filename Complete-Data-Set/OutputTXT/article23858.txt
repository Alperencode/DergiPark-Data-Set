Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECTS OF USE OF RECYCLED WOOD ON THE CONTEXT OF ECOLOGY AND INDOOR AND ITS USAGE AREAS
Özet: In addition to the fact that wood is a preferred material in every field, improving its sustainability will also become an acquired feature that will increase the usability of wood in the future. For this reason, the recycling process is a significant step for the wood to gain its sustainable quality and continue its use. The study's aims are to reflect that the wood, which is often preferred indoors, can also be used by transforming, that this use is an essential process in terms of ecology and sustainability, by examining the use and effects of this new material in the interior. In addition to many materials used by recycling, the reason for dealing with wood material, in particular, is that wood can be use in all areas as a living material. The importance of transformation, which is a critical point in determining the purpose of the research, allowed the study of topics such as recycled wood's usage areas as the scope of the examination, its effects on the interior, the contribution of wood to new products that emerged as additional material. The importance of the research is that it is based on studies that show that wood can be used as the primary material of a product, can be used as an interior support element, and can be used as an additive material. As a result of this research, it has revealed that it is possible to use wood as a processed or unprocessed raw material. It has been concluded that wood sometimes is seen as a material used outdoors and sometimes as a building material used indoors.

Makale Başlığı: Mineralogical and gemological characteristics of Kaman (Kırşehir-Türkiye) fluorites
Özet: Fluorites are found in the region between Hamit, Karakütük, Bayındır and Yeniyapan villages of the Kaman District (Kırşehir-Türkiye). Fluorites are located in altered levels due to faults in quartz syenites containing gray-pink colored K-feldspar, plagioclase and quartz, amphibole and biotite type mafic minerals in the Upper Cretaceous aged. Central Anatolian Granitoids, Fluorites observed in purple and green in places, pink, yellow, white colors as veins reaching from a few centimeters to two meters, purple and green in places, pink, yellow, white colors.According to X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results, quartz syenites are composed of quartz, feldspar and clay minerals; fluorites are composed of fluorite and quartz mineral combination. According to Wavelength Dispersive XRF (WDXRF) analysis results, it is observed that the amount of F in purple fluorites is 39.8%, the amount of CaO is 51.2%, the amount of SiO2 is 8.68%, the amount of F in green fluorites is 46.7%, the amount of CaO is 51.5%, and the amount of SiO2 is 1.15%. As a result of cathodoluminescence analysis, the presence of rare earth elements (REE) terbium (Tb), erbium (Er), dysprosium (Dy) and samarium (Sm) elements were observed in fluorites.In order for the fluorites in the region to be used as a gemstone; while features color variety, texture, and easy workability are revealed as positive features, features such as low hardness, low strength in atmospheric conditions, and cleaved structure in coarse crystals are determined as negative features. For this reason, the fluorites in the region can be used as gemstones, however it is important that they undergo improvement methods (saturation with epoxy).

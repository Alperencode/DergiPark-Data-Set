Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Macro-Economic Indicators on Foreign Trade Balance
Özet: With globalization, the mutual interaction of countries with each other shows a constant increasing trend. The role of foreign trade, which is an important factor in terms of international economic relations, is great in this interaction. Thanks to foreign trade, countries have the chance to use more advanced technologies in their own countries. Thus, countries produce more goods and services. In this context, foreign trade is a very important parameter that plays a role in affecting the growth performance of countries' economies and increasing the welfare of countries. The subject of this study is to examine the effects of the determinants of foreign trade on foreign trade for the top 20 countries with high foreign trade performance and the highest level of vulnerability. In the study, the effects of the determinants of foreign trade were tested with the help of the Panel Threshold EKK method using annual data for the period 1995-2019. According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that the exchange rate, interest rates, inflation rates and real product level are important determinants of foreign trade performance. However, it has been observed that the global risk level is not an important determinant of foreign trade performance.

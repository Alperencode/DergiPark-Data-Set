Makale Başlığı: Telelactation with Increased Visibility During Pandemic Process
Özet: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and was declared a COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. The pandemic process negatively affected the training and counseling service delivery, which are among the preventive health services. Considering the global targets of health, it is recommended to use telehealth practices actively for uninterrupted breastfeeding counseling during the pandemic. Telelactation is a telehealth model that presents scientific information about breastfeeding, breastfeeding problems, and solutions via audio talk or video conference and aims to encourage breastfeeding. Telelactation should be seen as an opportunity to provide uninterrupted professional breastfeeding support during the pandemic process and its active use should be further popularized.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of poultry meat products containing mechanically deboned meat by histological and chemical methods
Özet: Objective: In this study, it is aimed to determine histological and some chemical properties of poultry meat products containing mechanically deboned poultry meat.Materials and methods: For this purpose, histological examination and some chemical properties (moisture(%), ash(%), total protein(%), hydroxyproline (mg/100 g), total collagen (%) and calcium (Ca, mg/kg) quantities) were determined in heat treated chicken sujuk, chicken salami and chicken sausage samples at 6 distinct trademark obtained from Turkish global markets. The results of analyses were compared with the results of analyses obtained from control samples containing no mechanically deboned poultry meat.Discussion and conclusion: At the end of the study, higher ash, calcium, hydroxyproline levels and higher total collagen quantities were determined in the samples of chicken sujuk, chicken salami and chicken sausage seemed of containing more bone and more cartilage tissues in the histological examination. It was determined; 207.62-1,534.17 mg/kg Ca and 76.81-161.42 mg/100 g hydroxyproline in the heat treated chicken sujuk samples, 334-655 mg/kg Ca and 43.12-92.60 mg/100 g hydroxyproline in the chicken sausages, 121.47-703.22 mg/kg Ca and 52.64-83.78 mg/100 g hydroxyproline in the chicken salami samples. As a result, it is thought that evaluation of the results of histological examination together with the results of some chemical analyses (ash, protein, hydroxyproline, collagen and calcium) of the poultry meat products containing mechanically deboned meat would be more confidential to determine meat adulteration.

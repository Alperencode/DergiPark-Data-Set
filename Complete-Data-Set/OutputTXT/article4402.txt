Makale Başlığı: Separate Without Divorce: A Social Aspect To Living Separated
Özet: Marriage, which is frequently encountered in the construction process of consensual relations, is a form of union that has a formal meaning. Although it is based on a common future planning of the partners, it is an extremely normal process for these unions to end through divorce. While talking about the divorce in which the official relationship is terminated, living separated should also be considered. Multidimensional analysis is required to understand the process of living separated, which differs from divorce with many variables. In this study, it is aimed to shed light on the depth of the phenomenon of living apart and the psychosocial problems that may be experienced by the partners who prefer to live separated and the children, if any, from the literature. In addition, the basic principles on which various social policies that can be applied despite possible problems of living separated should be based were mentioned and suggestions were made.

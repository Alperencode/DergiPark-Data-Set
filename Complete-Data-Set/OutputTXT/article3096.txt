Makale Başlığı: Analyzing Some Relationships between Physical-mMechanical and Thermal Parameters of Bio-Briquettes Produced from Persimmon Pruning Residues
Özet: Turkey imports a considerable part of its energy means from abroad. This creates a huge burden on the national economy. Turkey can be considered as poor in fossil fuel resources, but rich in renewable energy sources. Biomass is one these renewable energy sources which comes from various agricultural production lasting whole year due to four seasons richness of the climate in Turkey. In this study, solid cylindrical briquettes produced from persimmon tree pruning wastes under 2 different moisture contents (12% -15%), with 3 different particle sizes (3-5-8 mm) and under 4 different briquetting pressures (80 - 120 - 160 - 200 MPa) were analyzed for its solid fuel properties. The lowest lower heating value was found as 18.50 MJ/kg where the highest lower heating value was 18.90 MJ/kg. The lowest ash content was obtained as 1.73% at 15% moisture content, 3 mm particle size under 200 MPa briquetting pressure while the highest was 2.47% at 12% moisture content, 5 mm particle size under 120 MPa briquetting pressure. The relationships between some physical-mechanical and thermal parameters of the produced briquettes were also analyzed.

Makale Başlığı: Estimating of Apricot Production of Turkey Using ARIMA Model
Özet: Purpose: To estimate the fresh apricot production in Turkey in the next four years and to develop suggestions by making use of the 1970-2019 period (50 years) data obtained from FAO and TURKSTAT. Design/Methodology/Approach: ARIMA (Box-Jenkins) model was used for future prediction for apricot production. Box-Jenkins method is one of the methods developed to analyze time series and is used to analyze univariate time series. In the study, the best statistical result among ARIMA models was obtained in ARIMA (1,1,1).Findings: According to the model results, it is estimated that Turkish apricot production will be 769426 tons in 2020, 761686 tons in 2021, 754236 tons in 2022 and 747052 tons in 2023. The most important risks encountered in apricot production are high input prices and frost risk. Therefore, farmers should be guided in obtaining agricultural insurance and spreading product sales over time. Originality/Value: Today, apricots are consumed as fresh and dry, and are also used as raw materials in fruit juice, jam, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Estimates about the future in apricot production are important in creating policies for farmers, consumers, exporters and industrialists. For this reason, researches on apricot production estimation need to be increased and updated.

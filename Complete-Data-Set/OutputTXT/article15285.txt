Özet: The main purpose of this study is in which the 2020 game called Cyberpunk 2077 is examined within the framework of the transhumanist approach, to analyze the ideology of transhumanism contained in digital games and to analyze the principles of the Transhumanism Declaration through the game's narrative and characters, and to question the way transhumanism is presented in the game's universe. During the first-hand experience of the game, the Nomadic background story and the character named V were chosen. The game was analyzed descriptively with the qualitative analysis method; based on the conceptual framework for the ideology of transhumanism, and it has been analyzed and interpreted under the categories created based on the Principles of the Transhumanism Declaration. In the findings, it was concluded that the play conveys the transhumanism approach from the framework of the current dominant ideology and constructs transhumanism through the imagination of a future world wherecurrent political economy conditions are valid. At the same time, the narrative of the play, in which these changes are told and mapped, is conveyed with images originating from the familiar dominant ideology of today, namely the traditions and belief systems of capitalism.

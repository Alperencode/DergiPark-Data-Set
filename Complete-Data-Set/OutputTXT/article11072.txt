Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Somatic Cell Count and Some Parameters in Cow's Milk
Özet: Somatic cell count (SCC), chemical composition and microbiological quality in cow's milk are among the important parameters in terms of general quality criteria. In the research conducted; In November-December/2020, samples (N:100) were obtained from a total of 100 randomly selected enterprises in the Çanakkale region, with an average of 22±5.24 dairy cows and milking with a manual milking robot, were evaluated 1000 ml milk samples collected from milk cooling tanks into sterile plastic bottles under aseptic conditions were brought to the laboratory under the cold chain and analyzed as soon as possible. While SCC was determined as a minimum of 5.000 units/ml and a maximum of 3.736.000 units/ml, it was determined that the number of TAMB varied between 2.56 and 9.06 log cfu/ml. Fat, protein, lactose and total dry matter of chemical parameters were found to be 3.24±0.61%, 3.03±0.19%, 4.74±0.51% and 11.76±0.28%, respectively. It was observed that there was a significant correlation (p<0.01) between SCC and lactose content and TAMB. It was determined that the rate of subclinical mastitis was 31% (31/100) in the samples. Raw milk samples; according to the Turkish Food Codex Communique on the Classification of Raw Cow's Milk, it is included in the A, B and C class milks in terms of % protein and fat value, 73 samples are in terms of TAMB number and 18 samples are legal in terms of Special Hygiene Rules Regulation for Animal Foods. observed to be above the legal limits. Developing measures for udder health and milking hygiene in enterprises and taking additional measures, making effective general and individual hygiene practices (shelter and udder cleaning, tools/equipment used in milking and personnel hygiene etc.) to be applied by business owners during milk production processes, it is thought that the monitoring and inspection activities of legal authorities at all levels from production to consumption will be beneficial in terms of public health and technological processes, and will ultimately contribute to the improvement of both the farm economy and profit maximization by increasing the quality and production amount.

Makale Başlığı: Biochemical and Histopathological Investigation of the Protective Effect of Lutein in Rat Kidney Exposed to Cisplatin
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the protection of lutein (L) (100 mg/kg, orally) against kidney damage caused by cisplatin (Cis) (10mg/kg, intraperitoneal).Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight rats aged 8 weeks were used and divided into four equal groups (n=7): Control, L, Cis, and Cis + L. Results: As a result of biochemical findings, serum Cr and BUN levels of the Cis group were significantly increased compared to the control group (p<0.05). Serum Cr and BUN levels of the Cis + L group were found to be significantly reduced compared to the Cis group (p<0.05). In addition, a decrease in MDA level and an increase in GSH, SOD and CAT levels were detected in the Cis + L group compared to the Cis group (p<0.05). In the histopathological examinations, in the Cis group kidney tissues; pathological changes such as interstitial mononuclear leukocyte infiltration, tubular degeneration, and tubular necrosis were observed. When the Cis + L group is compared with the Cis group, it can be said that there is a decrease in oxidative stress, an increase in antioxidant activity and a decrease in histopathological changes with the effect of L. Conclusion: These results show that L is effective in preventing Cis-induced kidney injury. It is also emerging that L is a pharmacological agent with the potential to be used in this damage.

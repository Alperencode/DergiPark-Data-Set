Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Different Nitrogen Doses and Seeding Rate on Grain Yield, Yield  Components and Some Quality Characters in Nusrat Bread Wheat Cultivar
Özet: This research was conducted in the Application and Research Center of Faculty of Agriculture, Uludag University, in a Randomized Split Blocks Design with three replications in 2020-2021 growing season. In the experiment, 3 different seed rates (300 seed m-2, 500 seed m-2 and 700 seed m-2) and 4 different nitrogen doses (0 kg, 8 kg, 16 kg, 24 kg per decare) were applied. The effects of these factors on grain yield, some yield components and quality characteristics of Nusrat bread wheat cultivar were determined. Increases in seed rates had statistically significant effects on the number of seeds/spike, seed weight/spike, seed yield and sedimentation value averages. There was no statistically significant effect on the averages of thousand grain weight, the rate of protein and gluten. Seed yield was taken at the highest value from 700 seed m-2. It was determined that the applied nitrogen dose increased up to 16 kg da-1, increasing the number of grains/spike, grain weight/spike, thousand grain weight and yield per unit area. As a result of the research; It can be said that the optimum seed rate and nitrogen fertilizer amount should be 700 seed m-2 and 16 kg da-1, respectively, in order to get the highest grain yield in Nusrat bread wheat cultivar in Bursa conditions.

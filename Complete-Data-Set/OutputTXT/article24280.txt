Özet: We have been studying on the protective role of CAPE on several disease models in animals and cell culture setups for several years. Here we would like to share our experience on a specific topic, bone resoption and some therapeutic approaches, and how CAPE was managed for this purpose by referring one of the great articles published in Acta Orthopaedica et Traumatologica Turcica, "Effect of salmon calcitonin treatment on serum and synovial fluid bone formation and resorption markers in osteoporosis patients" by Atbinici et al (2015;49:160-5). DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0339This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes. Published version may differ from the current version.

Makale Başlığı: Fathers' Experiences in the Perinatal Loss Process: A Systematic Review
Özet: Aim: While the people around the individuals who have lost their lives and the health workers focus more on physical and psychological state of the mother, the experiences of fathers are overlooked. The purpose of this systematic review is to understand the experiences of fathers in this difficult process. Material and Methods: Literature review, 'PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Cochrane' databases containing the studies done in the last ten years were searched and the studies on the subject between 2011-2021 were examined between 1-30 April 2021. Sixteen studies over the past ten years, which were available with full text, published in English, and which included the experiences of fathers who experienced loss during the perinatal period, were included. Results: Findings from studies were analyzed based on PRISMA reporting criteria. Nine of these studies were found to have quantitative, six qualitative, and one mixed research design. While it is noteworthy that most of the studies on the subject are in Australia, no study has been found in this field in our country. Conclusion: It was determined that fathers experienced intense grief, received the most support from their spouses, but still received insufficient support. It was determined that they wanted to receive professional support, they used more rational coping mechanisms, the role of paternity was formed in the early pregnancy period and they assumed the role of supporting their spouses. Fathers should be helped to overcome this process more easily by raising awareness throughout the society.

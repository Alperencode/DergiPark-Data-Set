Makale Başlığı: Structural Controls of High-Temperature and Deep Geothermal Systems Associated with Detachment Fault
Özet: In this study, the structural controls of a high-temperature system (188 to 287 oC) associated with the detachment fault in Gediz Graben generating approximately half of this electricity generation in Turkey which is in the top five of the world in the generation of electricity from geothermal resources are examined. The high-temperature geothermal reservoirs associated with detachment fault in the study area have formed along the normal faults nearly in E-W orientation and in intensely fractured rocks in a structurally complex manner associated with transfer faults approximately in N-S orientation. Generally, it has been determined that the reservoirs are closely located to strike-slip faults intersecting, overlapping, and/or terminated with Quaternary transfer faults.

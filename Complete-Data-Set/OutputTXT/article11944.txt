Makale Başlığı: Monitoring and Maintaining Cerebral Perfusion During Carotid Endarterectomy: Use of Selective Shunt Under NIRS and Root Pressure Guidance
Özet: Endarterectomy and eversion methods in carotid artery surgery are low-risk gold standard treatment methods applied to reduce the rate of stroke and mortality in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method and carotid root pressure measurement are commonly used methods for early detection of cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia. The most commonly used method to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion and reduce the risk of cerebral ischemia is the use of intraoperative shunts. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of decrease in NIRS rSO2 value and the effects of shunt use on peroperative stroke/mortality in patients who were decided to use shunt with a carotid root pressure value of ≤40mmHg. Between 2018 and 2020, 40 patients with stenosis of 70-99% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria and operated on were evaluated retrospectively. The mean ipsilateral NIRS values were 70.33±8.40 and 65.1±4.52 before clamping, 57.87±8.4 and 62.01±4.6 at the first minute after clamping in the shunt and non-shunt groups, respectively (p<0.05). In our study there is a good correlation between ≥15% reduction in NIRS rSO2 and ≤40mmHg root pressure threshold. Peroperative stroke and death were not encountered in our patients for whom the decision to use shunt was made with these values. However, we need larger prospective multicentre studies to identify the optimal cut-off value for the decrease in rSO2.

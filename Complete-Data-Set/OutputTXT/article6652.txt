Makale Başlığı: Establishment and Improvement of Police Organization in the Early Period of Turkish Republic
Özet: Although the police department was established in the period of War of Independence it is possible to assert that it was essentially established between 1932 and 1937 by legal regulations. Turkish police in 1920’s performed its duties through laws and officers which was inherited from Ottoman period. Furthermore, institutionalization process of the police department remained limited with only the headquarter and so the departments in cities hadn’t improved sufficiently in the aforementioned period. On the other hand, it was occurred a process that the police department was become stronger and its operational field was enlarged. It has importance to study three problematics in order to understand current situation of the police in this period. The first problematic is “what is institutional structure and human resource of the Turkish police?”. The second one is “For what purposes did the political power empower the police?”. And finally, “To what extent did the police adopt these aims imposed on it?”. The organizational structure and human resources of Turkish police organization in the early period of the republic between 1920-1931 and 1932-1938 which is the first of these three problematics were analyzed separately and comparatively in this study.

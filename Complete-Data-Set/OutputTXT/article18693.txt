Makale Başlığı: The Performances of Some Tomato Pure Lines under Cold Stress in the Vegetative and Generative Stage
Özet: Especially, in tomatoes occur due to low temperature stress serious yield and quality decreases in greenhouse conditions. For successful tomato cultivation under the cold stress, cultivars performances are extremely important both vegetative and reproductive growth stage.  In this study, 20 tomato pure lines and 3 commercial cultivars (Cigdem F1, Anit F1 and Bestona F1) and also Solanum hirsutum (LA 1777) known as tolerant genotypes were evaluated at vegetative and reproductive stage. The studies were conducted under both the cold stress in growth chamber and the optimal temperature condition (control) in the greenhouse. They were evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL)  and dry matter yield (DM) at vegetative stage. The results showed that EL rate and MDA content increased while DM decreased under the cold stress when compared with leaves of plants grown at optimal temperature. In reproductive stage, pollen viability and pollen germination were evaluated under both cold stress and control conditions for all genotypes. All the sensitive genotypes exhibited low pollen viability and pollen germination. Consequently, three pure lines were identified with low-temperature tolerant in vegetative and reproductive growth stage.

Makale Başlığı: SOME FINDINGS REGARDING RESIDENT SAYYIDS IN OTTOMAN KAYSERİ OF THE 17th CENTURY
Özet: Some general researches have been carried out regarding the sayyids of the Ottoman period. When these studies are examined, it is observed that the subject has been neglected for many years, but there has been a considerable increase in research on the subject in recent years. The main deficiency observed in the literature is the scarcity of studies on the sayyids in different places and periods of the Ottoman geography and prepared with a social history perspective. Based on this observation, it was thought that it would be useful to make a research about the sayyids of Kayseri in the 17th century. This study, which introduces the 17th century Kayseri sayyids, has been prepared. The sources of the study are 13, 20/1, 41/1, 41/2, 55/1, 55/2, 57/1, 57/3, 59, 60/1, 60/2, 61/1, 61/2, 64/1, 64/2, 66/1, 66/2, 69, 74/2, 75, 77/1, 77/2, 78/1, 78/2, 78/3, 82/2, 88, 91, 91/1, 91/2, 91/ 3, 92, 96, 100/2, 104 numbered Kayseri court registers, some Mühimme registers and some documents in the Ottoman archives.

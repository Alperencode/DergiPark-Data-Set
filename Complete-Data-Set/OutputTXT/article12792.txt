Makale Başlığı: Observed Genetic Bottleneck in Holstein Bulls Used As Stud in Türkiye
Özet: The more recent a bottleneck occurs, the more likely it is that its harmful effects will be avoided or minimized by management procedures. Even very large populations are likely to experience a severe bottleneck. The spread of artificial insemination and the global sperm trade have provided worldwide use of the sperm from the high-yielding bulls. In Holstein cows, which are the most common dairy breeds, the sperm from bulls raised by especially some countries are used globally. In addition, intensive selection programs applied to obtain high yield often result in allele losses. In this study, it was investigated whether breeding bulls used to inseminate Holstein cows in Türkiye were under any bottleneck effect or not. For this purpose, sperm from 300 high-yielding Holstein bulls produced in and imported to Türkiye was used as the material of the study. The bottleneck assessment was carried out by using Sign and Wilcoxon Tests under Stepwise Mutation Model and Two-Phase Mutation Model using Bottleneck v.1.2.02 program based on ten microsatellite loci. In addition, Mode-Shift analysis has also been interpreted to understand whether the bottleneck is recent or not. Based on this, it was concluded that a total of 300 Holstein bulls bred by 13 countries in 3 continents (Asia, Europe, Americas) were under pressure of a bottleneck effect in the past, but this bottleneck did not occurred in the recent time.

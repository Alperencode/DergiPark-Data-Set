Makale Başlığı: Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Electric Vehicles and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles Manufactured in Turkey
Özet: In this study the environmental impacts of electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles manufactured in Turkey were compared by using life cycle assessment methodology. The functional unit was chosen as 1 kilometre of distance covered by the vehicle. CCaLC software alongside CML 2001 method was used. The results show that while electric vehicles are the more environmentally friendly option as far as carbon footprint is concerned, there is no major difference between the technologies when other environmental impacts are also taken into account.. The overall impact scores calculated by assigning equal weights to the impacts revealed that electric vehicles have 4% higher environmental impact than internal combustion engine vehicles. The main cause of environmental impacts turned out to be automobile tires and the energy required for vehicle movement. If the targets for the proliferation of electric vehicles in Turkey are reached by 2030, the nation-wide carbon footprint of the country is expected to decrease by 1.6%. It was determined that the share of renewables in Turkish grid electricity production shall be increased if the environmental impacts of electric vehicle utilization is to be reduced.

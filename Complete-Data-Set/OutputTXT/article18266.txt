Özet: Scuba diving is an alternative tourism activity and a professional sports activity that has come to the fore in recent years. In order to carry out the scuba diving activity safely by protecting human health without experiencing an accident or incident, safety awareness must be created and, issues related to safety must be observed in a disciplined manner by both the instructors and divers. Excessive self-confidence, carelessness, insomnia before diving, etc., can cause damage to the human health. In this study, it is aimed to determine the risk factors in diving activities and the safety measures to be taken to ensure diving safety by interviewing diving instructors working in various destinations in Turkey. In the study, “case study,” which is one of the qualitative research designs, was used. The data were obtained by using “semi-structured interview method,” which is among the qualitative research methods. The data obtained from the interviews were analyzed with the content analysis method. The findings obtained as a result of the analysis show that loss of life and injuries can occur as a result of diving accidents, the number of accidents resulting in injury is higher than the number of accidents resulting in loss of life, and a significant part of the accidents are caused by the improper use of equipment or diving equipment that is not suitable for diving. In the prevention of diving accidents, it can be said that the safety measures to be taken regarding the correct use of the right equipment, making the diving plan carefully, ensuring the use of valid certificates, and providing an effective training are important.

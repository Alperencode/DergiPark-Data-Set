Makale Başlığı: Genetic Variation of Above and Below Ground Growth in Common Melon Lines
Özet: Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important agronomic interest for Turkey and worldwide. Melon has a wide range of genetic diversity and most of the available diversity is not well characterized. The knowledge of diversity level on basic root traits still needs to be investigated. In this study, we investigated five different melon lines and one wild melon genotype for their shoot and root morphological traits. According to our results, six different melon genotypes showed significant morphological diversity. Line Kışlık demonstrated the highest growth rate and the highest mean values in most of the above and below-ground morphological traits. On the other hand, Yabani showed the lowest values for those traits. However, yabani may have other advantageous traits for surviving and it needs to be evaluated in further studies. There is still very little knowledge of stress tolerance levels, photosynthetic capacities, and below-ground growth and development in melon species. We believe that this study may enable further studies on this species.

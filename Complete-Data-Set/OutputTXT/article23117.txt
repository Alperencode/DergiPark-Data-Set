Makale Başlığı: Traces of “Communication” in Social Studies Curriculum and 7th Grade Social Studies Textbook
Özet: Effective communication makes life easier by adding color to people’s lives. For this reason, the issue of communication is seen as an issue that needs attention. This study was carried out in order to reveal the patterning of the subjects and acquisitions related to “communication” in the Social Studies Curriculum and the 7th Grade Social Studies Textbook. In addition, the research reflects the paradigm of the relationship between the visuals in the 7th Grade Social Studies Textbook and the skills in the Social Studies Curriculum. In this respect, the document analysis method, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in this research. According to the results of the research, some of the Social Studies Curriculum acquisitions include communication codes such as “self-creation” and “life chronology”. Although the  acquisitions in the 6th Grade Social Studies Curriculum reflect high-level skills such as understanding of critical thinking and the ability to solve the problems encountered in legal procedures, communication-based acquisitions include a low rate of 6.5%. Within the scope of these results, the level of reflection of communication competencies in SSLCP to textbooks can be further increased in program development studies. “empathy” and “communication” club can be formed based on the skills in SSLCP

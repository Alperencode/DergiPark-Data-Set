Makale Başlığı: The Meaning of University Experience for the Visually Impaired: A Transcendental  Phenomenological Study
Özet: In this qualitative study, we investigated the blind university students’ experiences and how they made meanings of those experiences. Sixteen visually impaired female and eighteen male participants studying at various universities and majors have participated in the study. We followed the procedures of transcendental phenomenology design. We collected data through in person and virtual semi-structured interviews. After the analyses of the data, five major themes of dependency, learning, motivation, needs, and ontological equity and eighteen subthemes of these major themes emerged. In the conclusion and suggestion section of the paper, we have made suggestions for families who have blind children, blind university students, officials working at disability offices at universities, university instructors, engineers, architects, and contractors, as well as the society at large based on our findings.

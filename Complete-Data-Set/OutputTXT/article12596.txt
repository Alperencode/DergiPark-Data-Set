Makale Başlığı: Effect of Leadership Behavior Styles on Performance a Field Study on Civil Aviation Ground Services
Özet: Nowadays, the rapid growth of the civil aviation sector has brought with it great difficulties that cannot be predicted. Under these conditions, known classical leadership models have become more limited in effect. Today, the most fundamental problems of companies are that they do not have effective leaders who enable competition and performance. Organizations that are exposed to great changes, especially with the rapid growth in the sector and the development of technology, need leaders who can manage change and affect employee performance in order to overcome the challenges they face. In this study, the effect of leadership styles on job performance in ground handling companies, which have an important place in the aviation sector, was examined. The effect of inclusive and transformative leadership on job performance was investigated by using scales consisting of a total of twenty questions covering the variables of inclusive leadership, transformational leadership, and job performance. Data were collected from 213 employees working in ground handling companies at airports located in different regions of Turkey, by survey method, and analyzed with the help of Amos and SPSS. As a result of the analyzes made, it has been determined by this study that inclusive and transformative leadership approaches affect the work performance of the employees positively, that when these leadership approaches are exhibited, the employees express their ideas more effectively and adopt the organizational goals as their own goals by being a partner in change.

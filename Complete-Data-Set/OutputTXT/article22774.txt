Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Concept of Actual Interest in the Administrative Judiciary in the Light of the Decision of the Constitutional Court
Özet: Pursuant to the Administrative Justice Procedure Code No 2577, in order for an annulment suit to be heard, it is necessary that the petitioner’s interest is violated by the administrative act constituting the subject matter of the annulment suit. The concept “violation of interest” refers to the requirement that there must be a current, legitimate and personal link between the petitioner and the administrative act constituting the subject matter of the administrative case. When filing an annulment suit, the issue of whether the condition “violation of interest” has taken place is considered among the issues of prior review; and if the administrative case has been filed by persons who do not have an interest in filing the administrative case, the administrative case is dismissed on procedural ground i.e., on the ground that the administrative case has been filed by incapable persons. The requirement that the link of interest between the petitioner and the administrative act constituting the subject matter of the administrative case must be sought until the date the administrative case is adjudicated is controversial in the doctrine and judicial decisions. In particular the recent judgments rendered by the Constitutional Court on the disputes regarding administrative acts established against public servants necessitate a reevaluate of the requirement that the link of interest must be present by the end of the proceedings, taking into account the specifics of the annulment suit and constitutional principles.

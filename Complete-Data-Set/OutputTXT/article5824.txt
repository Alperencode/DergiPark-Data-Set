Makale Başlığı: SOME THOUGHTS ON THE HISTORICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF TURKISH MUSIC IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF IQÂ AND USÛL
Özet: There are similarities in various aspects between the structure of music, which consists of measured sound and rhythm patterns, and logic, which is the criterion of right thought. The usûl, which determines the rhythmic patterns of the music, ensures that the work appears in a harmonious and aesthetic structure and that the listener can hear the work in the same structure. The rules of logic, on the other hand, allow correct reasoning and obtaining information objectively. It is accepted that logical thinking gives objectivity to the universal and necessary conceptualizations of things and the judgments formed by their combination.With the usûls (rhythm patterns) in Turkish music, as in logical thinking, tunes and melodies are transformed into harmonious sounds that are transferred within certain patterns. This study will search for the central question of how usûls, as a logical criterion, provide the possibility of giving an objective structure to the work and creating objective musical judgments in the listener

Makale Başlığı: Semen Collection, Processing and Storage in Rabbits
Özet: The rabbit is quite suitable for biological research due to their physical properties and ease of working. Biotechnological studies are easily carried out thanks to the ability to collect semen from rabbits with the help of an artificial vagina without the need for euthanasia. The processing and storage of rabbit semen requires experience due to existing pollution, hypersensitivity to lipid peroxidation, and low total and progressive motility values after freezing and thawing. Similarly, the season and the frequency of semen collection also affect semen quality. The semen collection in rabbits with artificial vagina(AA) and electroejaculator(EE) are the main methods used. AV is preferred more often than EE in terms of not requiring anesthesia and the quality of the semen obtained. The most common semen extender used in rabbits is TCG (313.8 mM Tris, 103.1 mM citric acid, and 33.3 mM glucose) egg yolk (10-20%) extender. Cryoprotectant substances used in the long-term storage of rabbit semen affect the success of cryopreservation of semen. For this purpose, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and amide derivatives are frequently used in rabbits. Moreover, semen in rabbits is frozen using fast and slow methods. Studies show that the fertilization ability of semen decreases after freezing. Therefore, there is a need for advanced studies on the storage of semen in rabbits. In this review, it is aimed to give information about current developments in short and long-term storage of rabbit semen.

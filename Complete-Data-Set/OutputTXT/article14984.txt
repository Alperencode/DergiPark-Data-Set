Makale Başlığı: Bibliometric Analysis of Researches Examining Board of Directors with Agency Theory Perspective
Özet: The aim of this study is to reveal the development and trends of academic literature examining the board of directors with agency theory perspective, and thus to contribute to the literature and researchers who aim to do research on this subject. For this purpose, a search was conducted by using the keywords "agency theory", "board of directors", "board structure", "board composition", "board characteristic" and "CEO duality" in the Scopus database. As a result of the search, a total of 573 studies in business, management and accounting fields which were conducted between 1992-2022 constituted the research sample. The data set obtained from this sample was analyzed in “biblioshiny” application in the RStudio program. Analysis results reveal that the development of field is provided through articles, and the most frequently used keywords are "corporate governance", "agency theory" and "board of director". Also, the results indicate that the most cited publications put their journals at the top of the most cited journals list. Thematic map, on the other hand, reveals that even efforts to combine stewardship theory and resource dependence theory with agency theory have limited importance for the development of the field.

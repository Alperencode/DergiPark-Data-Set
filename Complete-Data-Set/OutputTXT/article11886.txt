Makale Başlığı: Migration and Language
Özet: Immigrant multilingualism is a highly politicized phenomenon. However, it might be argued that multilingualism is the most important consequence of human movement that is as old as humanity. Without language economic and political systems cannot function, people cannot communicate with each other, in short there can be no movement. Although the migration literature in social disciplines generally devotes very little space on multilingualism, starting with sociolinguistics, many sub-fields of linguistics have analyzed immigrant multilingualism for some decades now. In this article, the concept of multilingualism will be analyzed through these sub-fields. The connection between these fields and the current migration profile in Turkey today will be established through references to the Project, Contemporary Linguistic Diversity in Istanbul.

Makale Başlığı: Agent-Based Approach on Water Resources Management: A Modified Systematic Review
Özet: Social, economic, and ecological dimensions of water resources make water management a highly complex domain related to many intertwined human-nature systems. Therefore, the decision and implementation of sustainable policies require following the evidence-based approach. Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation is one of the latest computer-aided modeling and simulation applications widely used to understand the phenomena associated with water-related/human-oriented engineering systems. In this study, conducting a modified systematic review approach, a field-specific review of the 128 articles on water resources management with Agent-Based Modeling was presented. Application areas of Agent-Based Modeling in water resources management and examples of its use as a decision support tool were evaluated. As an integrative systematic review of Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, this study summarizes the leading work of Agent-Based Modeling applications on water resources management. Current trends show that water research professionals have often used Agent-Based Modeling as a social simulation tool. Due to its role in facilitating interdisciplinary research, its application area is widening. However, there is a need for a comprehensible and open share of application-oriented information to guide the scientific community.

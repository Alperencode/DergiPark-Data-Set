Makale Başlığı: Effects of Achillea millefolium extract on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced isolated rat uterine contractions
Özet: Objective: Achillea millefolium (AM) is widely used in traditional medicine in a wide geography due to its effects on the female reproductive system. However, its effect on uterine smooth muscle contractions is unknown. Our study aims to investigate the effects of AM on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced isolated rat uterine contractions. Method: Myometrial strips were obtained from 32 adult Wistar Albino rats. Contraction amplitudes and frequencies were recorded by isolated tissue bath system after either of the following: administration of only Krebs-Hanseleit (KBH) solution, administration of Achillea millefolium extract (AME); administration of KBH or AME after inducing contractions with oxytocin. The differences at the level of p<0.05 was considered significant.Results: When AM extract was administered at a dose of 2mg/ml, it significantly reduced the spontaneous (non-induced) contraction frequency compared to the control group with only KBH addition to the medium (AME: 2.37±0.49, KBH: 9.25±1.69, p=0.002). AME significantly reduced the amplitude of spontaneous uterine contractions in the administrations of 0.5, 1, and 2mg/ml (p <0.05). On the other hand, AME significantly reduced the amplitude of oxytocin-induced contractions in each increasing dose (p <0.05).Conclusion: It was revealed that AME significantly reduced the frequency and amplitude of both spontaneous and oxytocin-induced uterine contractions depending on the dose. AME should be used with caution in cases of preterm birth or miscarriage risk.

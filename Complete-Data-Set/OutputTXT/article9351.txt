Özet: Automation, machine learning and information systems concepts constitute the basic dynamics of the change of business management systems today. Robotic process automation is one of the most suitable areas of use, especially since the call center processes will replace the routine work of the customer representative with an automated system. Robotic process automation; With the advancing technology, it is a technology that aims to transform the business solution in which the Information Technologies department of technology companies can act as the human resources department for robots after 2020. Robotic workflow automation; It is a solution that includes robot, orchestrator, studio and robotic desktop automation components, and automating the workflow for all repetitive routine requests (initiated specifically for the call center, corporate firms and their customers) without requiring any human interpretation. This solution combines different technologies such as natural language processing, speech analytics and image processing. The areas where RPA (robotic process automation) technology is fed by artificial intelligence technologies; interpreting incoming requests in Turkish language with natural language processing, converting call voice data into text data with speech analytics, and enabling operating systems and browsers to directly use native libraries with image processing and supporting these natural libraries. In this study, a robotic process automation example has been developed for process improvement in the call center.

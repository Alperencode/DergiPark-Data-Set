Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Crosslink Density and Mechanical Values of Carbon and Kaolin-Silica Based Compounds for Different Vulcanization Parameters
Özet: Rubber materials are used in many areas with the discovery of vulcanization. Along with the increasingdemand, black and colored studies have started to be made in rubber compounds as well as differentrubber types. In this study, the properties of black and colored recipes created by using ethylene propylenediene monomer (EPDM) rubber at different vulcanization parameters were investigated. Differentproportions of carbon black were used in black recipes and different proportions of silica in colored recipes.Each compound was subjected to different curing parameters, and then its mechanical values and crosslink densities (CLD) were examined. It was found that the CLD increased with the increase in the amount of filler in black recipes and the maximum values of CLD, hardness and modules were vulcanized in 10 minutes, the CLD increased with the increase in the amount of filler in the colored mixtures, and themaximum values of CLD, hardness and modules were found to be vulcanized in 15 minutes. As a result ofthe study, it was concluded that the vulcanization parameters and the filler materials used affect the amount of crosslink density and mechanical values of the compounds.

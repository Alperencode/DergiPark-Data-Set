However, opening these areas to tourism without paying attention to the carrying capacity and without paying attention to their internal dynamics and conservation principles may cause serious ecological problems that cannot be reversed. In this study, it was tried to determine the awareness of the people living in Samsun about protected areas, their views and thoughts about these areas. In the study, a questionnaire developed by us was used as a data collection tool. According to the results of the survey; participants think that protected areas undertake important tasks for the world ecosystem, that new protected areas should be created in Samsun, that protected areas contribute to the local economy and have significant tourism potential. However, they also expressed their reservations that opening these areas to tourism may cause environmental pollution and a decrease in plant and animal diversity.

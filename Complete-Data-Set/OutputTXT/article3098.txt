Makale Başlığı: Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) Extract Promotes Motility, Microscopic, and Antioxidative Parameters of Ram Semen during Refrigerated Storage
Özet: This study investigated the effect of spirulina ethanolic extract (SEE) on the quality of ram semen during low-temperature liquid storage and the relationship between sperm features. Ejaculates were collected from five Djallonké rams, pooled, extended with Tris-egg yolk (TEY) enriched with 0 (control), 20 (SEE20), 40 (SEE40), and 80 µg/mL (SEE80) of SEE to reach the concentration of 200×106 spz/mL, and stored at 4 °C for 72 h. Extended semen samples were assessed for total motility, progressive motility, sperm motion characteristics, viability, membrane integrity, and morphology at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h of storage. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase, (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels were measured at 72 h of storage. The enrichment of TEY with SEE at 40 and 80 µg/mL, improved sperm total motility at 48 and 72 h of storage (P<0.05). Also, all SEE-treated samples evidenced higher progressive motility in comparison to the control at 48 and 72 h (P<0.05). SEE80 group showed the highest percentages of viability (76.26±0.90%) and membrane integrity (58.19±1.50%); whereas, SEE40 demonstrated the lowest percentage of morphological abnormality (18.14±1.01%) at 72 h of storage. SEE did not influence NO levels; however, at 40 µg/mL, it reduced MDA concentration and improved SOD and CAT activities (P < 0.05). Total motility was positively correlated to progressive motility (r=0.69, P<0.01), viability (r=0.91, P<0.01), and membrane integrity (r=0.49, P<0.05); while, morphological abnormality was negatively correlated to the other sperm parameters. Furthermore, MDA was negatively correlated to total motility (r=-0.91, P<0.01), progressive motility (r=-0.70, P<0.01), and viability (r=-0.91, P<0.01), and positively correlated to morphological abnormality (r=0.70, P<0.01). An entirely opposite figure was recorded for SOD. Overall, the results indicated that SEE, especially at 40 µg/mL, can protect ram semen against liquid storage-associated damages. Furthermore, positive and negative correlations exist between semen parameters.

Makale Başlığı: Mudaraba and Profit in Interest Free Banking
Özet: The banking system is the main factor shaping today's economy, which is based on the interest and debt relationship. The banking system is becoming the center of our daily lives, affecting even our daily shopping. This situation causes some problems for individuals with religious sensitivities.Interest is strictly prohibited in Islam. However, in today's modern world, commercial life revolves around interest, which is not legitimate in Islam. In order to adapt to the living conditions of our society, Muslims have developed an interest-free banking system that will allow the practice of the Islamic doctrine of interest-free life. Although the interest-free banking system, together with the advisory boards, is built on the principle of interest-free in the light of the principles envisaged by Islam, it certainly contains some problematic points under the banking conditions of the modern period. Therefore, it is very important to carry out solution-oriented studies against these problems. One of the studies in this field is Dr. Mudaraba, whose main aim is profit. It is the work of Cemal Kalkan that we examined.The main purpose of commercial activities is to make profit. Mudaraba is a profit-sharing agreement in which one party puts his labor and the other party's capital. Mudaraba has been used frequently as a financing method throughout the history of Islam. Kalkan's work also tried to find answers to the problems in applying contemporary mudaraba by determining how mudaraba, which is used as today's interest-free financing model, is compatible with classical mudaraba.

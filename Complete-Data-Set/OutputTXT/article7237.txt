Makale Başlığı: Antioxidant Properties, Total Phenolic Content and LC-MS/MS Analysis of Mentha Pulegium, Lepidium Draba and Centaurea Solstitialis
Özet: The Mentha pulegium, Lepidiıum draba and Centaurea solstitialis have traditionally been used in different cultures for the treatment of various diseases. We investigated the total phenolic content analysis, chemical compositions and antioxidant activities of different solvent extracts such as acetone, methanol and n-hexane obtained from the aerial parts of Mentha pulegium, Lepidiıum draba and Centaurea. The amount of total phenolic substance was determined as gallic acid equivalent determine. Also, the LC-MS/MS technique was used to determine the phenolic profiles of each extract. Finally, antioxidant activities of three extracts were determined by DPPH and ABTS methods. The highest total phenolic content for acetone, n-hexane and methanol extracts was found as 99 507, 46 305, and 18 227 μg GAE mL-1 in Centaurea solstitialis plant, respectively. While the major component rosmarinic acid amount in the acetone extract of Mentha pulegium was 128 195 μg analyte g-1 extract, this amount was determined as 780 383 μg analyte g-1 extract in the methanolic extract. The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was found in the acetone and methanolic extracts of Mentha pulegium as 77% and 79%, respectively. ABTS radical scavenging activity was also found to be 98% and 94% for Mentha pulegium in acetone and methanol extracts, respectively. The antioxidant capacity of the extracts is related to the total amount of phenolic substances.

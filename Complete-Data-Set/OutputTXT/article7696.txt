Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Brand Value on Word of Mouth Communication
Özet: This research, which examines the effect of brand value on word of mouth communication, was carried out on associate degree students studying at aviation departments in Istanbul foundation universities. “Convenience Sampling Method” was used in sample selection. Research data were collected by questionnaire technique. 507 pieces of data accepted as valid from the questionnaires distributed to the participants via Google Form were transferred to SPSS 26 and AMOS 21 programs and necessary analyzes were made. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that brand value has a positive and high level of relationship on word of mouth communication and positive word of mouth communication. However, the effect of brand value on negative word of mouth communication was found to be negative and moderate. The research has shown that while students in foundation universities with high brand value engage in positive word of mouth communication activities, they do not engage in negative word of mouth communication activities. As a result of the Anova tests, while the brand value, positive and negative word-of-mouth communication perceptions of aviation department associate degree students differed according to the studied program, their perceptions of word-of-mouth communication did not differ according to the studied program.

Makale Başlığı: THE HAMISH OGSTON FOUNDATION HERITAGE BUILDING SKILLS PROGRAMME IN ENGLAND
Özet: This short article explains the rationale for the development of the Hamish Ogston Foundation Heritage Building Skills Programme, a major in-work training programme enabled by the largest one-off investment ever awarded to heritage construction training in England. After briefly introducing the evidence for skills shortages in heritage conservation and the growing area of retrofit, it draws on literature and policy relating to building crafts, heritage conservation, and vocational education and training (VET) in England to establish the context for addressing them. In a wide-ranging discussion, it examines various social and practical constraints, before explaining how the Hamish Ogston Foundation Heritage Building Skills Programme proposes to make a difference.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMİC ON HOSPİTAL COSTS: A TRAİNİNG AND RESEARCH HOSPİTAL EXAMPLE
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the cost of health services provided to patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a training and research hospital. In the study, the files and financial records of patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated. Demographic, clinical and cost information of the patients were analyzed by transferring them to excel. Of the patients, 203 (55%) were male and 163 (45%) were female. In the distribution of patients by age, the largest group is composed of patients aged 25-49 with 39.07%. Additional risky diseases were detected in 165 of 366 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. While hypertension was observed in 105 (33.98%) patients, cardiovascular diseases were observed in 56 (18.12%) patients, diabetes mellitus was observed in 56 (18.12%) patients, and lung diseases were observed in 51 (16.51%) patients. The average length of stay in the hospital was calculated as 8 days for all patients. Of 366 patients classified according to their smoking status, 239 (65.3%) never smoked. The largest expenditure item of COVID-19 hospital expenditures was the pandemic care service with 1,658,238.45 TL (68,62%). Another important part of the expenditure amount was the intensive care cost with 401.403.08 TL (16.61%). The treatment costs of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 differed according to the gender, age, number of risky diseases, length of stay, smoking status, and whether they smoke and also have a risky disease. It is thought that this research will guide health administrators and health politicians in making effective decisions and planning patient treatments, understanding the importance of vaccination programs, implementing risky disease  prevention programs and managing hospital costs. It is also thought that it will guide researchers in conducting more comprehensive  research.

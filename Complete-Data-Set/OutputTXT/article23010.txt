The universe of the study consists of mothers living in Istanbul and children receiving pre-school education. The study group consists of 137 children and their mothers selected by easily accessible sampling method. The "Family Information form" developed by the researcher to collect data in the study; "Situation-Continuous Anxiety Scale" developed by Spielberger to measure the anxiety levels of mothers and adapted to Turkish by Öner and Le Compte (1976); In order to measure the anxiety levels of children, the "Anxiety Scale (Parent Form) in Preschool Children" developed by Spencer et al., (2001) and adapted to Turkish by Şahin (2020) was used. Due to the normal distribution of the data, the independent t-test was used to test the differences between the mean scores and the  personal information in the study, and One-Way Anova  analysis  to test more than two variables. The significance level was considered  as 0.05 in the tests. As a result of the  findings obtained, a positive relationship was found between the anxiety levels of the mothers and the anxiety levels of the children.. In other words, the increasing level of anxiety in mothers is one of the reasons why the child's anxiety also increases. It was concluded that the age of the mother also has an effect on the child's anxiety level. The mean scores of  the general anxiety and the  separation anxiety in children of mothers at an early age are higher.

Makale Başlığı: Multi-Criteria Analysis of Site Selection for Pasture Improvement: Provincial Example
Özet: The importance of meadows and pastures and their share in the agricultural sector are increasing significantly. Meadows and pastures are the cheapest and easiest sources to obtain quality roughage. Meadows and pastures are the cheapest and main feed sources for livestock in Turkey. Considering that sheep ang goats and cattle breeding is carried out intensively in our country, the importance of these areas becomes more evident. Therefore, it is very important to develop an effective and sustainable pasture system. In this context, it is aimed to analyse the adequacy of pasture capacities of a province based on general, district and village and to determine the places where pasture management should be applied first. To find pasture capacity adequacy, AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) based TOPSIS (Preference sorting technique according to similarity to ideal solution) method is used for grazing capacity formulation and for priority improvement areas. It was observed that the results obtained are consistent and are applied on a real given case study.

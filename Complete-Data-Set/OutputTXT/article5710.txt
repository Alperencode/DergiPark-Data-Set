Makale Başlığı: A New Convolutional Neural Network Based Method for Detection of Asphalt Cracks on Highways
Özet: Asphalt cracks on the highway surface are one of the most common pavement damage. If these cracks are not detected and taken care of on time, they grow and reach dimensions that will increase traffic safety and density. Therefore, it is very important to carry out the detection of asphalt cracks quickly. Traditional manual crack detection is extremely time consuming, very costly and requires a lot of effort. Therefore, the researchers concentrated their focus on the detection of automatic asphalt cracks. However, although automatic crack detection has been extensively investigated in recent years, it is still a difficult task due to the fact that cracks have different densities and the complexity of the pavement environment. In this study, a convolutional neural network-based method is proposed to overcome this difficulty. The proposed method was developed based on the convolution and inverted residual block structures used by MobileNetv2, which is known for its success and lightweight in classification and segmentation. As a result of the experimental tests, it is seen that the performance of the proposed method is higher than the other methods in the literature. This means that automatic asphalt crack detection is more successful.

Makale Başlığı: IS IT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE UNCERTAINTY IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET?
Özet: The subject of uncertainty is a phenomenon that has been researched and discussed in order to make the market more predictable by providing market balances in a historical process. Uncertainty is an important determinant of enterprise and investment for all kinds of markets, and it is effective at increasing and decreasing levels depending on time and events. However, due to the characteristics of the health services market, it is always considered as a factor that has to be taken into account.It is considered that the reasons why the concept of uncertainty in the health services market is more pronounced and effective than other markets are mainly due to the various differences in the field of health services, and an acceptance behavior has emerged about the concept of uncertainty in health services.In this study, the "uncertainty measures" that can be applied to other markets were evaluated as applicable to the health services market, and health markets were evaluated in terms of uncertainty measures in other markets, based on the hypothesis of "Uncertainty cannot be measured in the Health Services Market".  In the study, primarily, the definition of uncertainty in terms of the health services market was made, and the sources of uncertainty in the health market were tried to be determined as in other markets. The most frequently used uncertainty measures have been adapted to the health service market actors about the health services market uncertainty arising from these sources, and in this way, the measurability, quantification, and formulalability of the uncertainty in the health services market have been examined.As a result; Quantitative measurement of uncertainty in the healthcare market and making a numerical estimation of the expected uncertainty processes are hypothetically possible. Thanks to the determinable and predictable healthcare market uncertainty values, all actors in the healthcare market will have a higher level of knowledge in decision-making processes, face lower costs in a more balanced market, and make less risky investments.

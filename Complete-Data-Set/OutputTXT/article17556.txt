Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF SHORT SALES AND LIMITATIONS ON SHORT SALES IN CAPITAL MARKETS LAW
Özet: Short selling is the first prohibited or restricted capital market activity in times of financial crisis. It is considered objectionable on the grounds that it lowers prices in the capital market, prepares the ground for market manipulation, carries a settlement risk and triggers systemic risk. On the other hand, it is known that these transactions have benefits such as providing price efficiency and increasing the liquidity in the market by providing information flow to the market about the real value of capital market instruments. For this reason, instead of banning short selling transactions completely, there are regulations to carry out within limitations. In our study, the types, benefits and drawbacks of short selling and the reflections of the limitations foreseen in short selling transactions to the regulation in Turkey are examined.

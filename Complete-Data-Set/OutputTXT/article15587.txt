Makale Başlığı: A Numerical Method for Solving Singularly Perturbed Quasilinear Boundary Value Problems on Shishkin Mesh
Özet: In this paper, singularly perturbed quasilinear boundary value problems are taken into account. With this purpose, a finite difference scheme is proposed on Shishkin-type mesh (S-mesh). Quasilinearization technique and interpolating quadrature rules are used to establish the numerical scheme. Then, an error estimate is derived. A numerical experiment is demonstratedto verify the theory.

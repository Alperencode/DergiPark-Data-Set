Makale Başlığı: Geochemical investigation of the potability of surface water in Çit River and related creeks in Avliyana Basin (Gümüşhane, NE Türkiye)
Özet: In the study, physico-chemical parameters of Çit Stream and related creeks in Avliyana Basin (Gümüşhane, NE Turkey) were determined. In terms of physical parameters, it is seen that the Büyük Çit Stream has drinking water quality. According to piper diagram, all of the samples except one have fallen into region of class of CaCO3 and MgCO3 waters. The different one is the mixed water class. It has been determined that the metal content that may pose a risk to water is below the permissible limits. It has been seen that there may be only one point of risk for lead.  As a result, physico-chemical aspect of water quality of Çit River and related creeks in Avliyana Basin has been seen to be suitable for drinking water standards.

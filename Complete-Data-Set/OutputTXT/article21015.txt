Makale Başlığı: THE USE OF POETRY IN THE NOVEL "DAĞIN ÖTEKİ YÜZÜ" IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERTEXTITICAL
Özet: Erendiz Atasü published "The Other Side of the Mountain", the first novel of his literary life, which he started with short stories, in 1995. This novel, which won the 1996 Orhan Kemal Novel Award, has autobiographical features. There are examples of genres such as poetry and letters in this novel. The author wrote this inspired by the stories of his parents. In the novel, she included Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as a person in his work. He used letters and newspaper clippings to heighten reality. At the beginning of the most striking uses in the novel are the poems selected according to the chapters. Beyond being a novel belonging to the Turkish Literature of the Republican period, it integrates with Turkish poetry. The fictions in which the metaphorical counterpart is given with poetry makes this novel different. This work, which is directly related to recent history, will be tried to be examined with the theory of intertextuality in the relationship between novel and poetry.

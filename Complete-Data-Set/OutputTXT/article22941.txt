Makale Başlığı: VERBAL CLAUSES IN TERMS OF BEING AN ELEMENT OF THE SENTENCE AND COMPLEX COMPOUND SENTENCES
Özet: In the grammar resources of Modern Turkish, it is seen that the researchers cannot agree on the fact that the sentences formed with the verbals are complex compound sentences. Researchers cannot agree on some criteria in this regard. One of these criteria is whether the verbs have completely lost their properties, such as declaring a work, being, or movement; in other words, whether it declares a judgment in terms of form and meaning. Another criterion is whether verbs can take on the affixes of finite verbs such as time and person suffixes, whether it completely destroys the verb's feature of being a verb. In addition, it is a criterion put forward by researchers who accept these sentences as complex compound sentences that can be formally divided into their components and the verb clause being the element of the main sentence. In this study, the last of the above-mentioned criteria is discussed. According to the researchers who accept the complex compound sentence, the clause is an element of the main sentence in such sentences. That is, the clause can be the subject, object, indirect object, adverbial complement, prepositional complement of the basic sentence or can complement one of these elements.A clause constructed with verbals directly affects the meaning of the main clause. Or this kind of clause it affects the meaning of another clause that connects to the main clause and indirectly completes the main clause. In some sentences, it is seen that both situations occur with the use of more than one verbal.

Makale Başlığı: A Guide Proposal for the Evaluation of Risk Analysis Techniques Used in Occupational Health and Safety
Özet: The successful implementation of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) practices in production environments is directly related to utilizing the appropriate risk assessment technique. The calculated risk scores may differ due to the unique characteristics of each of the risk assessment techniques. Moreover, there are various situations where different answers can be given, such as the level of OHS knowledge required in the application of the techniques, the technical details, whether the techniques require teamwork, whether the technique includes preliminary preparation processes. Since the results of risk assessment are directly related to the measures to be taken regarding human life, it becomes an important decision problem according to which criteria should be considered in selection of the risk analysis technique. On the other hand, considering that all kinds of work carried out in enterprises require bearing a cost, the selection of the method is also an important decision for economic reasons. In the light of these explanations, in this paper, a study was conducted to determine the relative importance of the selection criteria of the risk analysis technique. Analytical Hierarchy Process, one of the most frequently used multi-criteria decision-making techniques, was utilized while calculating the relative importance weights of the criteria. As a result, the most important main criterion and sub criterion were determined as the technical criterion, and the sensitivity of the evaluation scale, respectively.

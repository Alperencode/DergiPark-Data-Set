Makale Başlığı: Characterisation of aluminium industrial wastewater and investigation of recovery alternatives
Özet: Aluminium industry is one of the largest sectors and wastewater generated from this industry could cause crucial environmental problems due to its high heavy metal concentration and conductivity. Therefore, this study aims to determine the characterisation of the wastewater discharged from the two aluminium facilities by considering water recovery potential. While Facility-A produces stainless steel kitchenware, such as pots and pans, In Facility-B, anodised coating takes place from secondary aluminium and wastewater is generated from the units where anodised coating baths and control processes are carried out. For the analyses, the wastewater composite samples from different sections, such as washing, sand-blasting and dyeing in Facility-A were taken in 2 and 24 hours. In Facility-B, three 2-hour composite influent water samples and an effluent sample from chemical wastewater treatment were taken to determine conductivity, pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), etc. As a result of the analyses made, a high value of TSS was detected at all sampling points in Facility-A. It was also seen that the conductivity after demineralisation process in Facility-A was below 30.  In Facility-B, it was determined that while the pH obtained from two influent samples was below the discharge limits and showed acidic characteristics, one sample was very basic with a pH value of 12.19 and exceeds the upper limit of discharge. All influent samples in Facility-B show high TSS content in comparison with discharge limits specified in the regulation.

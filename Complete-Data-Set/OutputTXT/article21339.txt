Makale Başlığı: Transcriptome profiling of Stevia rebaudiana MS007 revealed genes involved in flower development
Özet: Stevia  rebaudiana  is  a  medicinal  plant  recommended  to  diabetic  or  obese  patients  as  an  alternative  sweetener  owing  to  its  low-calorie property. Previous studies have found that the stevioside level is highest at the time of flower bud formation and lowest at the time of preceding and following flower bud formation. Hence, this study aims to identify the genes involved in the flowering of local S. rebaudiana accession MS007 by investigating the transcriptomic data of two stages of growth, before flowering (BF) and after flowering (AF) that were deposited under accession number SRX6362785 and SRX6362784 at the NCBI SRA database. The transcriptomic study managed  to  annotate  108299  unigenes  of  S.  rebaudiana  with  8871  and  9832  genes  that  were  differentially  expressed  in  BF  and  AF  samples, respectively. These genes involved in various metabolic pathways related to flower development, response to stimulus as well as photosynthesis. Pheophorbide A oxygenase (PAO), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit E (TIF3E1), and jasmonate ZIM domain-containing protein 1 (JAZ1) were found to be involved in the flower development. The outcome of this study will help further research in the manipulation of the flowering process, especially in the breeding programme to develop photo-insensitive Stevia plant.

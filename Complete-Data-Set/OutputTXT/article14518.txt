Makale Başlığı: Individuals' Perspectives on Work: Developing A Scale of the Thought of Work
Özet: People's feelings and thoughts are the factors that determine their behavior and direct their behavior. This study, which is important in terms of understanding the employees' thoughts about working, it is aimed to develop a theoretical and statistically appropriate, valid, and reliable measurement tool to measure the employees' perspectives on working. Following a rigorous scale development procedure and applying multi-stage studies (expression pooling, taking expert opinions, pilot analysis, structure and content validity, etc.), a five-factor measurement scale was determined for The Thought of Work, consisting of 17 items with sufficient reliability and validity. It is predicted that the scale developed by this study will be a solid basic tool for determining the working thoughts of individuals consisting of identity, caring for others, professional citizenship, personal satisfaction, and service dimensions, thus providing a better understanding of the relationships between the organizational behaviors that individuals will exhibit.

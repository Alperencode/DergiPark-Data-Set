Makale Başlığı: Relation Between Grammar Achievement and Types and Frequency of Errors in Grammar Course
Özet: This study aims to analyze the relationship between the students’ grammar achievement and types and frequency of errors they make in grammar course. The relevant data were gathered from an EFL class at a state university in Turkey by means of two sources; students' average scores of 3 midterm exams and audio recordings.  The analysis of the data revealed that the students mostly made phonological errors followed by grammatical errors consisting of syntactic and morphological errors. According to the results, high achievers tended to have more errors while low achievers tended to have fewer errors supporting the claim that errors are an indication of learning. However, it is difficult to infer a direct relation between these variables. The analysis of the data also indicated that there might be other factors affecting the frequency and types of errors such as number of the turns that students take, students’ personality traits, their willingness to participate and to take risks for testing their knowledge. The findings of this study also offer some suggestions for further studies on errors in language classrooms.

Makale Başlığı: System Proposal for Harvesting Raw Materials, Energy and Clean Water from Seas
Özet: This article proposes to obtain clean water, which can be a solution for the lack of precipitation and drought, which is expected to increase in the future, to obtain minerals from the seas as an alternative to today's expensive mining operations and to produce clean energy on a single system. The system described in this study aims to obtain mining products more easily, risk-free and cheaper by bringing a different perspective to the mining sector, which creates serious environmental problems today. In addition, an alternative to other systems that use various filters and chemicals while obtaining clean water from sea water has been introduced, and energy generation while obtaining clean water has been handled on the same system. While the prototype of the proposed facility has been realized, various suggestions and methods have been presented for the future success of the system.

Özet: The study was conducted to reveal the knowledge university students studying sports sciences about firstaid and basic life support (CPR). A total of with a mean age of 21.15±2.12 years who reached 803 universitystudents. Data were collected using a questionnaire which consisted of a total of 36 questions under threeparts. The questionnaire was prepared based on the 2015 guidelines of the American Heart Association andEuropean Resuscitation Council.It was found that 75,6 % of the university students had low level of first aid knowledge, and 99,7 % hadlow level of basic life support knowledge 83,3% of the university students received first aid training before,and 40 % reported that they received the training two years ago. One significant finding is that the firstaid (25,82±14,26) and CPR (45,23±22,88) scores of the university students who considered themselvescompetent in applying first aid were found to be lower than the others(p<0,05). The first aid knowledge level(56,40±21,12) of those who received applied first aid and CPR training was higher than those who receivedonly theoretical (53,13±21,65) training (p<0,05). The students of the Coaching Education Department gavethe highest number of correct answers to the First Aid and CPR questions. Almost all university students(88,4%) stated they wanted to receive first aid and CPR training. Our findings revealed that 90,4% of theDepartment of Physical Education and Sports Teaching students wanted to receive training, which showsthat the students in the teaching programs are more sensitive about first aid and CPR.It was found that the first aid and CPR knowledge level of the university students studying sports scienceswere low and, they were aware of this situation. Having received first aid training within the last year andboth theoretical and practical training positively affected the level of knowledge.

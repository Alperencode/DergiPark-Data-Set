Makale Başlığı: The Impact of the Argumentation- Flipped Learning Model on the Achievements and Scientific Process Skills of Students
Özet: The current study determined the impact of the Argumentation-Flipped Learning (AFL) Model on the scientific process skills and academic achievement of students by performing a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest and retention control group design. The data were collected by scientific process skills test and concept test from a total of 112 5th grade students randomly selected from a public school in the 2017-2018 academic year. In the curriculum, Experimental group-I and Experimental group-II students were taught the lesson by argumentation-flipped learning model and Flipped Teaching Method (FTM), respectively. The lessons in the control group were taught by the method where the teacher was the narrator. The information and the activities in the curriculum were presented directly. The study was applied in the “Matter and Change” unit. The data of the study were collected by scientific process skills and academic achievement test. SPSS 22.0 package program was used to analyze the data obtained from the study. Shapiro-Wilk Distribution Test and descriptive statistics were used to determine whether the data showed normal distribution. Furthermore, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used. According to the study’s results, it was determined that the methods applied to the groups did not make a significant difference in the levels of scientific process or in student’s academic success.

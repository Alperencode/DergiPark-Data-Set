Makale Başlığı: TRANSLATION AND ANALYSIS OF TWO AHIDNAMES FOUND IN THE RUSSIAN ARCHIVES OF SAADET GIRAY KHAN I PERIOD
Özet: Russian embassy reports are one of the most important sources we have to illuminate the early period of the Crimean Khanate, and the embassy reports must be examined. For this reason, we translated and analyzed two ahidnames prepared between the Moscow Principality and the Crimean Khanate of the Saadet Giray Khan I period, which we obtained from the RGADA (Rosskiyskiy Gosudartstvennıy Arhiv Drevnih Aktov/ Russian State Archive Old Correspondence Department) Archive in Moscow as a result of various difficulties. We wanted to contribute to the work of the Crimean Khanate in Türkiye, even a little bit. However, Saadet Giray Khan I period is briefly described, since we think that it would be wrong to give a direct translation of the documents without explaining the conditions of the period and without explaining why the ahidnames were repeated at short intervals. After giving information about the period, the translation of two ahidnames was added to the end of the study.

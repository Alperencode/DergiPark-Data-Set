Makale Başlığı: Social Life Cycle Assessment for Sustainability in Production Sector: A Cement Production Case Study
Özet: Nowadays, the analysis of social issues during the production, use and disposal of cement becomes im-portant for companies in terms of their social responsibilities for sustainable development. Social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) is a method that facilitates companies to work in a socially responsible manner, by providing information about the social impact of products or services, activities in the life cycle, worker, society, consumers, local commu-nity, value chain actors on their stakeholders. In this study, the S-LCA of an enterprise whose main activity is cement production has been examined in terms of worker stakeholder among the stakeholder categories proposed by UNEP/SETAC. Social and socio-economic aspects of blue- and white-collar employees working in cement production stages and their positive and negative impacts covering the S-LCA were evaluated comparatively. In inventory anal-ysis, site-specific data were collected through questionnaires conducted with employees, and a scoring method be-tween 0- 4 was used in the impact assessment of the determined subcategories. As a result of the study, the subcate-gories which have the most negative social impact were social assistance/social security and freedom of association and collective bargaining (2 score) for blue-collar employees. Considering white collar employees, social impacts were positive, and all subcategories were calculated as 4 score.

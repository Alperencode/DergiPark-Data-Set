Makale Başlığı: RELIGIOUS CO-EXISTENCE AND INTERRELIGIOUS DIALOGUE ACTIVITIES IN ALBANIA
Özet: In our days the world and especially western societiesare facing a lot of problems and challenges concerning cultural issues. As aproduct of globalism modern communities show the necessity of coexistencebetween persons who belong to different races, religions and nationalities. Inthe conditions of economic, political and social turmoil that the world facestoday, religion seems to be an important factor in the installation of positiveand constructive values which are the basic elements of coexistence in amulticultural society. By the second half of twentieth century not only thereligions themselves but also international political organizations increasedthe efforts to promote the interreligious dialogue and the coexistence inmulticultural societies. Such activities were very common in Albania after 90’swhen the Albanian people guaranteed the right to freely move, political pluralism,the freedom of speech and that of belief. As an old European nation, theAlbanians have lived for centuries in harmony even their religious affiliationconsisted in Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox communities. The historical past andreligious composition of Albania is an example of interreligious coexistencethat can be a model for the modern societies which face numerous problemsregarding multicultural coexistence.

Makale Başlığı: New reality of touristic travel in digital technologies: Virtual space
Özet: The digitalization process in tourism, which is the reflection of Industry 4.0 developments on tourism, shows itself in the context of tourism with a new activity product every day. Virtual reality tourism activities are the most remarkable and offer the closest experience to the real tourism activity. Next-generation reality technologies have the potential to offer a revolutionary new environment, thanks to well-crafted operating systems for virtual space. This situation creates a new concept of reality based on the combination of virtual and reality, with the integration of the virtual space perspective with the real perspective. In the social life cycle that has changed due to the global epidemic in recent years, the individual tends to experience daily life practices in virtual space and may turn to virtual touristic products within the framework of virtual space. At this point, it seems possible to obtain real-like tourism experiences within the framework of touristic products offered with virtual reality glasses. This research aims to evaluate the touristic travel experience in virtual space that can be experienced with virtual reality glasses and to understand how similar touristic travel products will develop in the future

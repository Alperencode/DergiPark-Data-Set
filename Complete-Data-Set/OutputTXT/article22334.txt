Makale Başlığı: Determination of somatic cell number and other quality characteristics of raw milk from milk collection centers in Erzurum
Özet: In this study, 30 milk samples were taken from different milk cooling tanks in Erzurum central districts and it was determined whether they comply with the standards with the differences between some microbiological, physical and chemical qualities. In the study, milk samples taken from milk cooling tanks into sterile containers on the same day were used. The average number of TAMB (TAMB) and Somatic Cell Number (SCN) of the samples, respectively; 5.5×106 cfu/mL and 5.35×105 cells/mL. Dry matter, Fat, non-fat dry matter, protein, lactose ratios, freezing point, specific gravity and pH averages of milk, respectively; 13.82%,4.78%,9.06%, 3.26%, 4.97%, -0.592 °C, 1.029 and 6.64. Formaldehyde and carbonate were not detected in any of the samples. Considering the microorganism load and SHS, it can be said that the milk is not milked under hygienic conditions, it is not kept at suitable temperatures after milking, or the milk is taken into cooling tanks after waiting. Composition differences are probably due to the fact that the cows from which milk samples were taken were of different breeds, were fed with different feed rations and were formed in different lactation periods.

Makale Başlığı: Industry 4.0 and Cybersecurity at Automobile Manufacturing in Smart Factories
Özet: The automotive industry in smart factories is constantly developing depending on technology. Depending on the developing technology, security problems come to the fore. Industry 4.0 and cyber security are widely used in automotive sector applications as well as in all areas of our lives. These applications pose security threats to automotive users and drivers. Attacks on vehicle software, especially by autonomous vehicle users, endanger passengers and vehicle safety. It should take the necessary precautions to be protected against cyber-attacks and be equipped to solve the problem. The rapid change of technology in smart factories and with industry 4.0 brings new security vulnerabilities and new cyber attacks. The hostility arising from inter-sectoral competition has lost its value compared to previous periods and has left its authority to cyberattacks, threats, and damaging moves against system security. Industry 4.0 is also known as the Industrial Revolution Industry, which covers a specific production technology and the interests of many groups, and exchanges data without human use and innovative system. With this industrial revolution, which also plays an active role in the establishment of a smart factory, more useful work examples are obtained as it ensures that each data is collected and analyzed in the best way in the production area. In this study, cyber attacks in the automotive industry and cyber threats in automobile factories are examined. In addition, layered protection has been proposed by investigating how to take precautions against these attacks and threats.

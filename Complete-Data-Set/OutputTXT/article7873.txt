Makale Başlığı: Usefulness of Homoeopathic Medicine in Oppositional Defiant Disorder(ODD):A Case Report
Özet: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a disruptive behavioural disorder in which a child displays a pattern of an angry mood, defiant or combative behaviour, and vindictiveness toward people in authority. The child's behaviour often disrupts their daily routine, including activities within the family and at school. An 18-year-old male reported in the Out Patient Department with symptoms of anger and vindictiveness. The consultant psychiatrist diagnosed it as a case of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Disruptive Behaviour Disorder Rating Scale (DBDRS) – ODD items was used to assess the severity of the disease.   Modified Naranjo Criteria was used to assess whether the changes were likely to be associated with the homoeopathic intervention. Overall improvement was noticed clinically. DBDRS score was 22 at the time of admission. Sepia 200 was selected as the individualized homeopathic medicine. His symptoms got improved and he was discharged. DBDRS score was reduced to 0 at the end of 16 months. Individualized homoeopathic treatment has shown a positive role for the management and treatment of disruptive behavioural disorder.

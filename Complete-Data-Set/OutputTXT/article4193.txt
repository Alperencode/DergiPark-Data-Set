Makale Başlığı: Orality in foreign language textbooks: An investigation of speaking exercises and tasks in the regional DaF textbook 'Deutsch macht Spaß (A1.2)'
Özet: This article examines the speaking-tasks and exercises as an important part of orality in a current German language coursebook Deutsch macht Spaß (A1.2) student book in Turkey. In the history of foreign language teaching methods, the emphasis on oral aspects has fluctuated. On the one hand, the importance of oracy for the essence of language has been recognized in many disciplines, wheras the way in which some behaviorist and grammar-driven language teaching methods tried to improve L2-oracy is considered outdated. The current post-method-era, on the other hand, with a focus on principles such as action-orientation, competence-orientation instead of methods, encourages more reasonable ways. In this context, the research desideratum arises as to how the elements of foreign language teaching and learning processes, including teacher-instructions, materials, etc., deal specifically with oral skills in particular. The findings of the present qualitative and inductive coursebook analysis demonstrate that, among other things, the conceptual and medial aspects of orality come to the fore as an important aspect that should be systematically taken into account in the development of future German language coursebooks.

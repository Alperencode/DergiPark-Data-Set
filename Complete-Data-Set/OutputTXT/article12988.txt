Makale Başlığı: A statistical evaluation of the effect of natural gas usage for urban heating on the air quality of Erzurum City via SO2 ve PM10
Özet: In this study, the alteration of air quality in the Erzurum urban atmosphere starting from the winter period of 1978-1979, when air pollution began to appear in Erzurum for the first time, until the 2018- 2019 period was statistically analyzed by choosing as the criteria parameters sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) and taking into account meteorological parameters such as the relative humidity, average temperature, precipitation, wind direction and speed. Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models have been used for this purpose. Since the most important factor that will affect the change of air quality in the Erzurum urban atmosphere is natural gas, which was started to be used for urban heating in 2005, the relationship between the results obtained from these models and the use of natural gas was determined. In order to determine the effects of 2005 and other years, if any, tests were firstly applied for determining the structural break dates. The results obtained showed that there was a highly significant structural break with a correlation of aproximately 75% in the PM10 model of 2006, the year after the natural gas became widespread in the city, while it was 2009 for the SO2 model with with a correlation of 72%.

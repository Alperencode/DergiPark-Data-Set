Makale Başlığı: RECEP PEKER'S THOUGHTS ON FASCISM AND QUESTIONING A CLAIM
Özet: In the memoirs of Hasan Rıza Soyak, who served as Atatürk's private secretary and secretary-general during his presidency, there is a famous assertion that cannot be verified or denied. Accordingly, Recep Peker, Secretary-General of the Republican People's Party (CHP), created draft regulations and programs for the CHP, copying fascist parties in Italy and Germany, with the goal of building a party state in Turkey. Peker's works enraged Atatürk and finally caused him to fall out of favor with him. Most works dealing with Recep Peker's worldview and approach to fascism regarded this occurrence recorded in Soyak's memoirs as true without any questioning, and numerous inferences were drawn based on this assumption. However, Soyak's memories can only be properly interpreted if it is not forgotten that he was a participant in the period's political struggles. Soyak was a member of the inner circle of Atatürk who preserved his distance from İnönü and Peker. He took a more liberal stance than these two people. The impact of the period's political disputes was reflected in Soyak's memories, as well as the memories of many people who were involved in these struggles at the time, and the memories in question should be read in this context. It is more scientifically useful to study Peker's approach to fascism through his works rather than Soyak's memories, which cannot be validated with documents. It would be reasonable to seek answers to the following questions in such a study: Was Recep Peker's approach to diverse ideologies consistent? What were the causes for any changes that occurred in this regard? Were Peker and CHP executives unaware of the programs of European parties, particularly fascist parties, before Peker’s trip to Italy in 1935? Why is this issue portrayed as though it arose out of nowhere in 1935-1936, if they were aware? What was Recep Peker's influence on the ideology and organization of the CHP, were there any conflicts within the party on this matter, and did these disagreements have an impact on his opponents' conceptions of Peker's ideology? Since the program and draft regulations described by Soyak could not be found, what conclusion can we draw about Peker's understanding of fascism from his writings and speeches, as well as his notifications to the party organization? It is argued in this study that, like various ideologies that were influential in Europe at the time, fascism was scrutinized by Kemalist intellectuals prior to 1935, that after the double crisis of liberalism in the 1920s, pragmatic modernist tendencies, which were also seen in other countries around the world, were also seen in Turkey, and that Recep Peker's approach to fascism can be grasped to a large extent within this pragmatic modernist framework. Peker regarded Nazism and fascism as an ideological threat to Turkey, and he criticized fascist movements for being reactionary and defending nationalism based on race. However, with the authoritarian trend seen in Turkey in the 1930s, Peker, who had an authoritarian worldview, began to express harsher criticisms of liberalism and parliamentarism, and he acknowledged that the fascists were right for opposing movements such as liberalism and socialism, which he thought led to class conflict. The reactions Peker received were a result of his efforts to establish the control of the party over the state, as well as his authoritarian tendencies, which occasionally strained the limits of pragmatic modernism.

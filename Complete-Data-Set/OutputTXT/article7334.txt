Makale Başlığı: Social Issues on the Academic Performance of Secondary School Learners in the Limpopo Province
Özet: South Africa, after Apartheid and with a democratic government and newly amended policies, committed to provider equal opportunities to every citizen, including the right and access to education. The purpose of this study, following the state of the education system as it is, is to investigate the social issues that contribute to the poor performance of secondary school learners in South Africa, and specifically the Palala circuit in the Waterberg district, Limpopo. A mixed methods approach was used (qualitative and quantitative) to investigate the possible improvements that could be used to deal with the social issues facing secondary school learners. The target population was 10 secondary schools in the Palala circuit in the Waterberg district, Limpopo. The sample was 10 principals, 10 Head of Departments (HoDs), 10 Life Orientation teachers, and 30 learners, 3 per school in the 10 selected schools. The response rate was 93% and data was collected by using questionnaire surveys and interviews with the same 56 participants. The study revealed the predominant social issues that affect the academic performance of learners in secondary schools in the Palala circuit as poverty, teenage pregnancy, bullying, low self-esteem, and parental unemployment. The strategies to eradicate these social issues are in place and need the input and active participation of all stakeholders, especially government, community members, teachers, parents, and the learners themselves.

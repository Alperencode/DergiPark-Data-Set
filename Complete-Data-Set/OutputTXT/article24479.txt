Makale Başlığı: Factors Affecting Mortality in Rapidly  Progressive Diabetic Foot Ulcer Patients
Özet: DOI: 10.26650/cjm.2019.43.39Objective: A diabetic foot ulcer withprogressive infection is a life-threatening condition that requires urgentsurgical intervention. Because of the severity of this condition, it isimportant to understand its epidemiological and prognostic background. Thisstudy aims to evaluate the epidemiology of the diabetic foot ulcer and describethe etiology and the surgical procedures performed to treat it.Methods: A retrospective review of 35diabetic patients with foot ulcers was performed. These individuals wereadmitted to the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized betweenApril 2006 and April 2011. Factors affecting their mortality were statisticallyassessed.Results: The long duration of ulcertreatment and need for intensive care were found significantly related tomortality (p<0.05). There was a trend toward higher mortality in the patientgroup with cardiac comorbidity (24% versus 20%), but this was not found to bestatistically significant.Conclusion:Infective diabetic foot ulcers may have a highly mortal course. Havingknowledge of how to discriminate between the acute infection and the factorsaffecting patient mortality may lead us to making better prognoses anddelivering more effective treatment.Cite this article as: Demiröz A, Arslan H.Factors Affecting Mortality in Rapidly Progressive Diabetic Foot UlcerPatients.

Makale Başlığı: Language Development of the Preschool Children: The Effects of an Audio-Visual Intervention Program in Delhi
Özet: Preschool may not be a place where formal education is imparted but yes, it  definitely is a place where children have their first taste of independence.  Preschool education is the provision of education for children before the  commencement of statutory education usually between the ages of 2 and 5. Thus  the purposes of the study were: to study the effectiveness of the audio-visual  intervention program on the language development of preschool children in  relation to their socio economic status. The researcher employed experimental  method to conduct the study. The sample consisted of 100 students from preschool  of Rohini, Delhi. Thus the total study consisted of 100 children of class L.K.G.,  besides, all (100) parents of the all sampled children covered under the  experimental and control groups were included in the sample so as to collect the  data related to their SES. The Language Development Test was developed by  investigator and Socio Economic Status standardized scale was used. The findings  of the study were: (i) the Audio-visual Intervention Program has also positively  affected the overall language development of the preschool children; and (ii) the  Audio-visual Intervention Program has not been found to be differently affecting  the language development of the preschool children at different SES levels. Hence,  in many ways the findings of the present study can be beneficial in strengthening  the non-formal preschool education component. It can be useful for the young  children, the teachers who handle the young children, teacher training institutions  and the policy makers as well

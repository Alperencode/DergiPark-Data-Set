Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Asymmetric Causality Between Growth and Emissions in Turkey
Özet: This study investigates the asymmetric causal relationship between emissions and growth over the period of 1960-2018 in Turkey. The Environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis has mostly been used to test the relationship between growth and emissions. However, in testing this hypothesis, each variable added to the model and the period chosen changed the results. Thisstudy asymmetrically examinesthe relationship between emission and growth using the variable’ cumulative positive and negative shocks instead of applying the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. To do so, we use a short-run asymmetric causality test and a hidden co-integration for long run. The estimation results of the crouching error correction model revealed long-run asymmetric causal relationships. In the short run, although no causal relationship exists between the growth and emissions components, a unidirectional asymmetric causality was determined from the negative component of emissions to the negative component of growth. We found a long-run equilibrium relationship between the positive components of the variables and the positive emission component and the negative growth component. Thus, both contractions and expansions in growth increase emissions in the long run. The results are expected to contribute to the literature regarding environmental policies to be developed for Turkey, which has a sustainable development and emission reduction target.

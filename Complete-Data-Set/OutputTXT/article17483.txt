Makale Başlığı: Aydın Yalçın’s Perspective on the Relationship Between Ataturkism and Democracy in His Articles in the Öncu Newspaper and in This Context, the May 27 Coup
Özet: Following the May 27, 1960 military coup in Turkey, the pursuit toward a new direction and order to the political system was the primary agenda in every social segment, particularly including the intelligentsia. Atatürkism was at the forefront in these turbulent and uncertain times as the most extensively discussed and defined ideology in the process of solution seeking, and it was embraced by different viewpoints. One of the intellectuals who grounded Atatürkism was Aydın Yalçın; a liberal intellectual who had worked as a professor, the Editor-in-Chief of Öncü newspaper, and a politician. This study aims to analyze at which points Atatürkism overlapped withthe core values of democracy in Yalçın’s intellectual realm. In this study, document analysis of Yalçın’s perspective on the May 27 coup is restricted to his articles published in Öncü as the Editor-in-Chief between 1960 and 1962. Yalçın analyzed the discussions on the reestablishment of democracy in Turkey and defined the suitable environment for it to grow. Furthermore, he rejected any “ready-made formulas,” any “-isms,” and any political move that excluded a democratic system. In Yalçın’s intellectual realm, in which he considered Atatürkism compatible with the core values of liberal thought as well as democracy, Atatürkism stood for a guarantee for democracy.

Makale Başlığı: Friendship and Rivalry: Local Relations and Cultural Environment in Constantinople and Nicomedia in the Light of Libanius' Orations and Letters
Özet: Nicomedia and Constantinople, the two largest cities of the Roman Empire on the Marmara  coast,  drew  attention  as  very  rich  and  developed  metropoleis  in  the  3rd  and  4th  centuries.  These  two  cities,  which  were  successor  capitals,  also  attracted  the  aristocrats,  scholars,  orators  and  statesmen  of  the  period  with  their  cultural  environment. The sophist Libanius of Antioch, who lived in both these cities, gives very valuable information about these cities. Orations and letters of Libanius provide quite  detailed  information  on  remarkably  interesting  topics  such  as  friendship  relations, local rivalries and factions, schools, educators, social networks and the local policies of the emperors in these two great cities. By putting Libanius in the center, this study aims to show the local relations in Constantinople and Nicomedia in the 4th century, as well as the socio-cultural environment and the differences between these  cities.  In  addition,  the  contributing  factors  of  the  cultural  environment  that  allowed  Nicomedia  to  compete  with  Constantinople,  the  new  residence  of  the  emperors, until the devastating earthquakes in Nicomedia, were also discussed.

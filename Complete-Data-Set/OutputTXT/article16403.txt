Makale Başlığı: AN EVALUATION OF THE REALIST GENERATION IN LITERATURE BY SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER
Özet: In Modern Turkish Literature, various periods are frequently mentioned for the novel genre (e.g. Tanzimat period novelists or the National Struggle period novelists...) Especially in the 1940s, we see that a realist and socialist generation began to take part in the literary tradition. The writers who stand out with their intellectual and literary identities begin to write novels with a sensitive perspective to the problems of the country. In this sense, despite the slight differences in their perspectives, Fakir Baykurt, Orhan Kemal, Sabahattin Ali, Kemal Tahir, Vedat Türkali and Yasar Kemal are considered among the important representatives of this generation. Focusing on the realities of Turkish social structure, these writers successfully employed many social-cultural phenomena in their novels. Through events and protagonists, they opened up to discuss the deep-rooted problems of Turkey. The heroes of these novels adopted a stance against the important social problems of Turkey. Poverty, landlordship, working life, feudalism, blood feud and immigration are among these social problems. This study aims to examine how women are considered in terms of gender sociology in the novels of all six writers. The study is thought to contribute to the reading of feminist literary criticism in terms of female novel heroes in the novels of the realist and socialist generation.

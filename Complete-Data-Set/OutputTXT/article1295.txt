Makale Başlığı: HOUSEHOLD DEMOGRAPHICS AND PREFERENCE FOR ORGANIC PRODUCTS IN SEVEN MAJOR FOOD CATEGORIES
Özet: Abstract: Amid increasing health concerns about industrially processed packaged consumer products, demand for organic products has risen in recent decades. Using rich panel data on food purchases of more than 60 thousand U.S. households, this study examines consumer profiles of organic products in seven major food groups. Results show that demand for organic products increases with income and education level. Preference for organic products is higher in younger households and peaks in the 30-34 age group and it also increases in smaller households consisting of four or fewer people. The effects of these demographic variables are strongest for staple foods such as cereals, milk, and eggs. Organic consumption increases in households with a young child, especially in categories that typically make up an important part of a young child’s diet, such as eggs and dairy products.

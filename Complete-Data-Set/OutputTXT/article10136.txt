Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Possible Risks and Failures in Terms of Surface and Environmental Conditions in the Route Selection of Underground Oil Pipeline with FMEA, Pareto and AHP Methods
Özet: With the rapid development of cities today, oil is common intensely operated fossil energy origin such as coal. Experts from various fields should come together and work, planning and projecting practices should be carried out interdisciplinary in all processes from extracting this energy source from underground to making it ready for use and even logistics. Oil pipeline projects have a significant share in the logistics or transportation of petroleum fuel. Especially in the creation of such projects, the importance of route choices is increasing. In route projects prepared for the logistics of petroleum fuel, topographical (superficial), geological, environmental, etc. have to considered. During the preparation of these projects, it may be possible to encounter some failures and risks arising from these factors. Mentioned risks and failures have explained by using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Pareto and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods in the study. Again, while determining these failures and risks, a study was tried to be presented by taking into account the risks and failures stated by experts on this subject and it was purposed to help for literature of same content. Also, results found by these methods have measured with others and findings have supported by graphics.

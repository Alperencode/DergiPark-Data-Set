Makale Başlığı: Nature-Culture Dichotomy and the Transformation of Mansur Bey in Lüzumsuz Adam
Özet: Human has been in an effort to make sense and interpret it since the moment he existed on earth. While realizing this, he has defined his surroundings with their opposites. This shows that both life and our signification system have a dualistic structure. Therefore, the terms nature and culture are opposite definitions within the dualistic structure. Culture is a concept that emerges as a result of the separation of man from nature, which is why it is located right in front of nature. Nature; it is considered a field of absolute pleasure, desire, satisfaction and fulfillment. Culture, on the other hand, is the domain of law and prohibition that prevents absolute pleasure and satisfaction. While nature is the medium of transformation, change and motion, culture is the medium of stasis, form and harmony. To define it allegorically, Dionysus represents nature while Apollo represents culture. While nature embodies idleness, vagrancy, wandering, vagabondism, in short, laziness; culture represents the hardworking, productive, disciplined individual. For this reason, all types other than the human type designed by the culture that separates from nature and builds the city are negated within the framework of modernity. On the other hand, in Sait Faik's Lüzumsuz Adam, published in 1948, the city and the human portrait that the city wants to create are criticized. In this study, the conversion of Mansur Bey in the story Lüzumsuz Adam [The Unnecessary Man] has been evaluated within the framework of nature-culture contrasts.

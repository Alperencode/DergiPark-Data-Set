Makale Başlığı: Effect of product presentation videos on purchase intention: The YouTube example
Özet: The aim of the study is to reveal the effect of product presentation videos shared on YouTube on the purchasing intention of consumers. In addition, the effect of product presentation richness on purchase intention and whether media usefulness and perceived enjoyment have a mediating role in this relationship are tested by structural equation modeling method.371 valid survey data were collected with the questionnaire form delivered to the participants online, and the obtained data were analyzed using AMOS 24.0 and SPSS 23.0 programs. The result of the study revealed that while the product presentation richness had a positive effect on the perceived enjoyment and media usefulness, media usefulness has a mediating role between product presentation richness and purchase intention. Moreover, while ease of imagining the product and media usefulness had a positive effect on purchase intention, ease of imagining the product has a full mediating role between perceived enjoyment and purchase intention, has a partial mediating role between media usefulness and purchase intention. The results make the research important in terms of determining the points that will affect the purchasing behavior of consumers while preparing product presentation videos.

Makale Başlığı: Changes of plant nutrients K and Mg in several plants based on traffic density and organs
Özet: Among the mineral nutrients, potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) are essential mineral nutrients for plants’ growth, development, and many biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis. If K or Mg is not present in plants, they are adversely affected by this situation. The excess of K and Mg concentration in plant tissues results in plants' toxicity. This study aimed to determine the variations in K and Mg element concentrations in branches, leaves, and seeds of Aesculus hippocastanum L., Prunus cerasifera Ehrh., Tilia platyphyllos Scop., Acer negundo L., and Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle, which are frequently used in urban areas, especially in landscape studies, based on traffic density. As a result, the changes in the elements based on the traffic density in all organs and organs in all traffic densities were significant (P<0.05). The highest concentrations were often found in individuals grown in areas with heavy traffic. The study results revealed that the element concentrations could show significant differences between organs in the same species, and this difference varies significantly based on species.

Makale Başlığı: GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SANCTION REGIME IN INTERNATIONAL LAW
Özet: In terms of international relations literature, sanctions are the means of pressure that are put into effect in order to punish the state, organization, group, company or person or to force the desired behavior. States apply various types of pressure when their demands on other rival states are not met. It is desired to achieve different goals in the sanctions that are applied unilaterally or by a combination of several countries in accordance with or contrary to international law. Therefore, it is important to examine the definition, concept, meaning and types of sanctions in this regard. These sanctions appear as a means of coercion or diplomatic pressure that both states and international institutions and organizations apply when they deem necessary.

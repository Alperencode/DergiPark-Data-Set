Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECTS OF WOMAN-CENTERED CARE ON VITAL SIGNS, ANXIETY AND COMFORT LEVELS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL
Özet: Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the woman-centered care given in the early postpartum period on vital signs, anxiety and comfort levels.Method: The study is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. 120 women were assigned to each of the experimental and control groups by the permutation block randomization method. Woman-centered care was given to the experimental group and standard care to the control group. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal Wallis, Wilcoxon Ranks Tests were used in the analyses. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant.Results: Socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar in both groups (p>0.05). There was a difference between posttest mean scores from the State, Trait Anxiety, and Postpartum Comfort Scales of the experimental and control groups (p=0.001; p=0.002; p=0.001). A difference was also identified between pretest and posttest total mean scores from the State, Trait Anxiety, and Postpartum Comfort Scales of the experimental group (p=0.001).Conclusion: In the early postpartum period, the recipients of woman-centered care were found to have lower state and trait anxiety levels and higher comfort levels compared to the recipients of standard care. It was determined that the pulse and systolic blood pressure were lower in women with low anxiety levels receiving woman-centered care.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Melih Cevdet Anday’s Poem "Gnomon" (Güneş Saati) with Ontological Literary Theory
Özet: The social responsibility of the artist against the social order is quite different. Anday, aware of this responsibility and also a poet of a transition and struggle, was not indifferent to the issues of the country and successfully reflected the concern and sensibility of the country in many of his poems. Melih Cevdet Anday, who first took part in Strange movement in the formation of modern Turkish poetry is one of the important identities who dared to create new doors in the Turkish poetry and expanded its borders. Anday who took credit for himself from the country's situation and had social awareness made an effort to integrate art with the people one-to-one with his friends Orhan Veli Kanık and Oktay Rıfat Horozcu. This study tries to analyse Melih Cevdet Anday's poem Gnomon-Güneş Saati in line with the ontological poetry theory. Ontology is a word formed by the combination of Greek words ontos (existence) and logos (being), briefly the knowledge of being. A work of art should be analysed from outside to inside within four layers including 1. sound base, 2. meaning units, 3. object and character base, 4. destiny layer. Consisting of three main structures, the Gnomon poem generally describes the existence and time of human on earth.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Exhibition Policy of Artifacts in Museums on Visitor Experience and Learning Motivation
Özet: Museums have been an essential instrument of cultural tourism and have become a necessary stop of cultural tours. Although the collection and the quality of the collection are among the parameters that make a museum possible, there are temporal, spatial, artifacts, and thematic fictions in its intellectual background. The aim of this study, which was carried out specifically for the Şanlıurfa Archeology Museum, is to investigate whether museums’ exhibition policy affects visitor experience and learning motivation. At the same time, whether these dimensions have a mediation role in the visitor experience was investigated in this study. In the study, a questionnaire was applied to 511 visitors who visited Şanlıurfa Archeology Museum and were selected with the convenience sampling technique. At the same time, a scale was developed regarding the exhibition dimensions of museums. By looking at the data obtained as a result of the study, the hypotheses put forward in the research were confirmed. It was determined that exhibiting artifacts in museums positively contributed to the visitor experience and learning motivation.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Corneal and Lens Densitometry with Scheimpflug Imaging in Young Beta Thalassemia Patients
Özet: The aim of this study is to compare corneal and lens density of children with Beta (β) thalassemia and healthy controls using Pentacam HR. This is a case-control and cross-sectional study. Anterior segment parameters, corneal, and lens densitometry of patients with β-thalassemia and healthy controls were evaluated with Scheimpflug corneal topography. For corneal densitometry analysis, the 12 mm diameter area of the cornea was divided into four concentric radial zones and anterior, central, and posterior layers according to corneal depth. The mean densitometry value for the crystalline lens was calculated in three regions around the center of the pupil. Non-contact specular microscopy was used to examine the morphology of the corneal endothelium. The study group consisted of 32 β-thalassemia major patients and the control group consisted of 31 healthy volunteers. The mean age of the study group was 12.12±3.94 years (range: 5-19 years) and 10.90±3.84 years (range: 5-19 years) in the control group (P>0.05). Corneal light backscattering in the posterior layer was significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group. Corneal endothelial cell density was determined as 3053.55±189.71 in the patient group and 3214±195.12 in the control group (P=0.094). Lens densitometry values did not differ between the two groups (P>0.05). We detected changes in corneal densitometry examination without any clinical findings in patients with β-thalassemia major. Pentacam may be a suitable screening technique for early detection of β-thalassemia ocular signs in children. Prospective studies with a large number of cases are needed to support these findings.

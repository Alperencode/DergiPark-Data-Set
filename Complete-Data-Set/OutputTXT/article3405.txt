Makale Başlığı: An overview to analyticity of dual functions
Özet: In this paper, the analyticity conditions of dual functions are clearly examined and the properties of the concept derivative are given in detail. Then, using the dual order relation, the dual analytic regions of dual analytic functions are constructed such that a collection of these regions forms a basis on $D^n$. Finally, the equivalent of the inverse function theorem in dual space is given by a theorem and proved.

Makale Başlığı: ACCOUNTING PROCESS OF TAKAFUL TRANSACTIONS BY PARTICIPATION INSURANCE (TAKAFUL) COMPANIES
Özet: The effects of risks can be reduced by many methods developed to protect people from risks they may encounter. The most widely used of these methods is insurance. Insurance transactions, which are expressed as compensation for the loss that may occur in return for a certain premium, are carried out by insurance companies. A distinction can be made according to whether these companies take into account Islamic rules while carrying out their activities. Companies that do not take into account Islamic rules can be specified as classical insurance companies, and companies that take into account Islamic rules can be specified as participation insurance (takaful) companies. The aim of the study is to explain the concept of takaful and to make accounting records of takaful transactions. For this purpose, first of all, the concept of takaful, takaful insurance models, and the differences between takaful from classical insurance are explained. Then, domestic and foreign sources about the evaluation of the accounting process of takaful transactions and the accounting records of the transactions are included in the literature. In the application part of the study, the accounting process of takaful transactions was carried out in line with the insurance chart of accounts used by insurance companies.

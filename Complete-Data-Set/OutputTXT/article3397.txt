Makale Başlığı: On the zeros of R-Bonacci polynomials and their derivatives
Özet: The purpose of the present paper is to examine the zeros of R-Bonacci polynomials and their derivatives. We obtain new characterizations for thezeros of these polynomials. Our results generalize the ones obtained for the special case r=2. Furthermore, we find explicit formulas of the roots ofderivatives of R-Bonacci polynomials in some special cases. Our formulas are substantially simple and useful.

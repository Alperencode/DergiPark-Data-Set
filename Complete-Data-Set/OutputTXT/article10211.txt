Makale Başlığı: The Symbolic Imagination of Horacio Quiroga’s Story “Wild Honey”
Özet: The purpose of this study is to analyze the story “Wild Honey” by Horacio Quiroga, one of the leading writers of Latin America, within the framework of the French philosopher Gilbert Durand’s theory: the Anthropological Structures of the Imaginary. The traumatic events that Quiroga experienced in his personal life are reflected in his literary style. Quiroga, who frequently includes themes such as wild nature and death in his stories, is one of the most influenced by American Gothic author Edgar Allan Poe. The story “Wild Honey” is about the protagonist Gabriel Benincasa’s journey into the wild forest. This journey, which started as a process of initiation, results in Benincasa being paralyzed by poison from the honey he ate in the forest and being eaten by a swarm of carnivorous ants called corrección until there is not the slightest bit of meat left on his body. Therefore, there is a failed initiation process in this story; Benincasa's journey into the wild forest, which is a threshold for him to pass from a weak individual to a strong individual, turns into a death journey when everything goes wrong in the forest. The objects such as sturdy boots, rifle, machete which reflect Benincasa’s urban life, the invasion of corrección, the events that Benincasa experienced in the jungle will be examined with regards to the symbolic meanings and will be discussed in terms of the contrast between diurnal and nocturnal regimes in Durand’s theory. By emphasizing the symbols that Horacio Quiroga used consciously or unconsciously, it is aimed to reveal the deep meaning of the story and to contribute to the relevant field of the study.

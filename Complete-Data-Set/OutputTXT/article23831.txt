Makale Başlığı: Editor's Foreword
Özet: As the annual peer-reviewed periodical of the newly founded Turkish Institute of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, this journal hopes to establish  international readership in Turkey and beyond through publishing peer-reviewed articles bilingually in both English and Turkish. We aspire to become a highly valued research institute journal, as known from other worldwide examples. The main aim of the Institute is to promote scholarship and further scholarly discussions that document, preserve, discuss, study, and advance the understanding of the cultures of Anatolia and its environs as well as the intercultural relations in the region. The journal functions toward accomplishing this mission. Our goal is to disseminate information, create an academic discussion platform, and promote interdisciplinary dialogues.

Makale Başlığı: Active Perpetrators Passive Victims: Madness as a Feminine Disease in Beş Sevim Apartmanı
Özet: In this study, the association of the concept of madness, which is considered out of norm and positioned against the mind, with femininity and the gendering tendencies of madness in literary texts, will be read on the basis of Mine Söğüt's novel titled Beş Sevim Apartmanı. By centering on the relationship between madness and femininity, the stories of five patients with mental health issues residing in a five-storey, fiveroom, and five-window Beş Sevim Apartmanı, will be addressed in light of their feature that brings together fantasy and reality, reason and irrationality. The collected material is considered based on the focus of gender roles. Considering the functions of madness such as marginalization and control the gender identity of women in the novel will be discussed in the focus of “madness” by making them passive victims. These stories of madness in women consider an existence denied by their fathers and husbands because they were not born men and did not bring a son into the world. In doing so, they allow us to witness what the patriarchy almost made the fate of womanhood, and that ultimately, women who could not change their fate could only change their world by going mad.

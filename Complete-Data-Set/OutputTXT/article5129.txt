Makale Başlığı: Investigation by molecular dynamic simulation of mechanical cycle applied to Cu nanowires with different crystal orientations
Özet: In this study, the effect of uniaxial tensile loading-unloading cycles applied to nanowires formed by placing Cu atoms in different crystallographic directions on the mechanical properties of the model system was investigated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation method. The forces effecting on atoms were determined from the derivative of the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential function, which includes many-body interactions. For the 1x1010s-1 strain value, the stress-strain curves, modulus of elasticity (E), yield stress values were examined by applying three tensile loading-unloading deformations to the nanowires at temperatures of 10 K and 300 K. By using the atomic images obtained as a result of the applied cycle processes and the common neighbor analysis method (CNA), it was determined that the plastic deformation in the nanowires occurred as a result of activation of dislocations, stacking defects and twinning for all orientations. However, it was determined that the nanowire did not fully return to its original shape for all orientations when the loading was removed. In addition, it was observed that break up occurred in the third cycle for <110> Cu nanowire. It was found that the applied cycling process had a significant effect on the mechanical properties for different crystal orientations of the nanowires.

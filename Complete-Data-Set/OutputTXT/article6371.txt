Makale Başlığı: An Elderly Care Model for Turkey
Özet: Demographic changes and their effects, which have emerged worldwide with the industrial revolution, have become more visible and perceived in our country since the 2000s. This demographic transformation, which has arisen with the prolongation of life expectancy and the aging of the population, has also brought along new social risks and problems. Some of these problems mentioned previously; are the aging population's need for care and the problem of care. There is no feasible model for elderly care in our country. Since there is no seeking for a solution regarding the elderly care problem, the expectation is that the care service is to be resolved usually within the context of informal social networks. The demographic change, the effect of which has become more visible in recent years, signifies that the problem cannot be solved in this way. If a practicable care model is not established soon, we may face a situation in which older people have to take care of more older people and despair in old age. While forming a model for the solution of care problems, it is thought that the model's care organization or objectives and complex structure should be understood initially.The organization of care outlined and staged in this article has been presented as a solution offered to create a practicable care model for the problem of the need for care.

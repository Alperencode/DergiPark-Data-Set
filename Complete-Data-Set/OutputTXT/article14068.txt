Makale Başlığı: Güney Sudan'da iç Savaş ve Önündeki Zorluklar
Özet: South Sudan’s recently ended civil war began shortly after gaining independence in 2013. The conflict grew out of proportion and became disastrous for the world’s youngest nation. In 2014 pressure amid sanctions from the international community forced rival parties into a productive process of a peace deal. However, there was little success as both the rebel militia and the government anticipated the downfall of each other. January 2015 indicated a positive move: the parties agreed to a cease-fire and peace talks were outlined.  Mediators and other neutral parties, on the other hand, must take advantage of the situation to ensure stability. Another year of war will undoubtedly lead to a division, which will ultimately endanger South Sudan's sovereignty. This article describes the causes of ethnic struggles, military operations, the consequences of war, the role of external forces, and how to reach peaceful solutions.

Makale Başlığı: Modernleşme Sürecinde Tasavvuf ve Günümüzde Tasavvuf Kültürünün Taşıyıcıları
Özet: Modernization is a social life style that started in Europe in the seventeenth century and spread the culture of enlightenment and the lifestyle of capitalism to the world. Pluralism and individualization processes that started with the modernization have revealed a relaxation in religious integrity and institutionalized religiosity. The shocking effect of modernization on the meaning of religion has weakened the traditional structures and institutional identities of Sufi movements. It has also weakened the ability of these secondary structures, which are between the individual and the state, to fulfill their social functions. This study focuses on the effect of modernization on the Sufi movements and who the bearers of this culture are today. This study aims to understand the transformative effect of the modernization process, which comes as a package that includes patterns of consciousness and directs behaviors, on the traditional religious institutions. Qualitative data obtained through screening method were discussed within the framework of Berger and Luckmann's theses. In the study, it has been concluded that new religious groups have emerged with the Republic period, which surpass traditional forms, are compatible with modern public structures and tolerate individualization at a certain level, and that these groups are the stakeholder bearers of Sufi culture today.

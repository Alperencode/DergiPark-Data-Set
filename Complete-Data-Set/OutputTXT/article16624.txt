Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMINATION ON THE USE OF GROTESK IMAGES IN PAINTING ART
Özet: The term grotesque, which emerged with Roman art, corresponds to concepts such as vulgar, strange, ugly, ridiculous. This concept, which started to spread in Europe during the Renaissance period, was frequently depicted by artists by including other meanings over time. Grotesque depictions have been used a lot in describing the social, political and economic disruptions that developed in the historical process, concepts such as war, pain and death. Starting from this point of view, this research deals with the grotesque images used by artists such as Hieronymus Bosch, Francisco Goya, James Ensor, Francis Bacon and Yue Minjun in the period from the Renaissance to Contemporary art, the way these images are used and the semantic dimensions that all these images leave on the viewer and it is aimed to deal with and analyze the semantic dimensions left by all these images on the viewer. In this context, in the text, firstly, information about the grotesque, which is the main subject of the research, is given, and then the artists who produce works in this context and their works are discussed. The literature review method was used to obtain the data in the study. The data in the text are discussed in the conclusion section. Although the use of grotesque depictions varies depending on the period in which the artists live, it has been revealed that the visualized form of the message conveyed by the works to the audience is ugly.

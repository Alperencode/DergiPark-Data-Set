Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Optimal Solution Type and Volume for Inflation of Foley Catheter Balloon in Indwelling Urethral Catheterization
Özet: Objective: In this study investigates the effect of the type and volume of solution used in inflation of the foley catheter balloon on the development of urine leakage around the catheter during indwelling urethral catheterization.Material and Method: This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted with 128 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit and carried out between 2015 and 2019. In each study group, different types and volumes of the solution including 10 mL 0.9% sodium chloride, 15 mL 0.9% sodium chloride, 10 mL sterile distilled water, and 15 mL sterile distilled water were used to inflate the foley balloon.Results: In the study, 7% of the patients who underwent indwelling urinary catheterization had urine leakage around the catheter. Urine leakage occurred on a mean of 11.33±8.22 days of catheterization. The urine leakage rate was calculated as 7.22/1000 catheterization days. Urine leakage rates of 10 mL 0.9% sodium chloride, 15 mL 0.9% sodium chloride, 10 mL sterile distilled water, and 15 mL sterile distilled water on the day of 1000 catheterization were 7.72, 5.60, 13.25, and 3.01 catheterization days, respectively. The most frequent urine leakage was in catheterizations using 10 mL sterile distilled water. Urine leakage was lower in catheterizations using 15 mL sterile distilled water compared to other groups.Conclusion: Using 15 mL of sterile distilled water to inflate the balloon can minimize urine leakage to ensure that the catheterization continues safely.

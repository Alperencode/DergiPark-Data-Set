Makale Başlığı: INCREASE IN VALUE AFTER NON-AGRICULTURAL USE OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND DEMANDING INCREASED VALUE BY THE HEIRS
Özet: After the transfer of the inherited agricultural land to one of the heirs, it may be possible to grant non-agricultural use permission to the land and increase the value of the land as a result. In practice, especially the granting of zoning permission to the land and the fact that the land is a residential, industrial or commercial area increase its value to a large extent. In this case, the heir who takes over the agricultural land based on its income value gains an unfair advantage over the other heirs. In order to protect the balance between the heirs and to ensure that other heirs benefit from the increase in value, With Law Code 6537 on Amending the Law on Soil Conservation and Land Use, a regulation was made in the 5th paragraph of article 8/C added to the Soil Conservation and Land Use Law Code 5403. Other heirs can benefit from the said increase in value, provided that certain conditions in this provision are met. In this study, the conditions for demanding an increase in value were examined, the issues that were not clear in the provision were criticized and solutions were presented.

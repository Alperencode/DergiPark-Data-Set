Makale Başlığı: Establishing the City of Gyumri as a Center of Russian Military Advance and Its Importance for the 1828-1829 Ottoman-Russian War
Özet: In wars, the starting and logistics points of the operation are as important as the cities and regions where the military operation is targeted. Although these cities and regions, which remain as operational points, remain in the background compared to the places where the main war took place, they have a great importance in determining the course and outcome of the wars. From this point of view, the city of Gyumri played an important role in the Ottoman-Russian Wars in the 19th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Russian Empire began to dominate the South Caucasus region rapidly in line with its military and political aims. For these purposes, Russia, which annexed Georgia in 1801, took over this region completely with the fights she had waged against the Iran and Ottoman Empires. In this study, the problem of determining a strategic center that will affect the course of the war in the military operations that the Russian Empire will organize against the Ottoman Empire in the Caucasus Front has been examined. Among the evaluations made on strategic points, the selection of Gyumri and the reasons for it were emphasized. Also, the importance of Gyumri in the Ottoman-Russian War of 1828-1829 was evaluated.

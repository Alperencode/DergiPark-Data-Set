Makale Başlığı: Difficulties Encountered in Sound-Based Primary Literacy Teaching According to Teachers' Viewstitle
Özet: The aim of the study is to determine the thoughts and evaluations of the teachers regarding the Voice Based Literacy Teaching Approach and the difficulties they encountered in the literacy activities they carried out with this approach. The research was designed as a case study by adopting a qualitative research approach. The study group of the research consisted of 13 voluntary primary school teachers who work in public schools in Istanbul and have taught at least once with the Sound-Based Literacy Teaching Approach. Descriptive and content analyses were used to analyze the data obtained through the semi-structured interviews formed by researchers. It was determined that the use of the phrase "Sound-Based Literacy Teaching Approach" in the Turkish curriculum caused conceptual confusion. On the other hand, nearly half of the teachers expressed a positive opinion about the literacy teaching carried out with the said method, while the other half stated that there were some limitations and problems. Family origin (methodological conflict), student origin (insufficient readiness, absenteeism), education policies (not all students receiving pre-school education, starting school at an early age), physical opportunities (crowded classes, economic impossibilities, insufficient textbooks) and method (going from the part to the whole, difficulty to understand, losing time and energy, having difficulties in reaching open syllables and combining syllables) were among the most frequently mentioned. In line with the results of the research, some suggestions have been presented to solve the problems.

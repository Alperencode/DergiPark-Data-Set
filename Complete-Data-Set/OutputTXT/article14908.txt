Makale Başlığı: TURKEY, D-8 AND ITS ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
Özet: States and societies today are faced with very complex problems such as financial crisis, power conflicts and climate change that transcend their borders. It seems almost impossible to overcome these without forming special structures for cooperation. In addition to international organizations such as the United Nations and supranational organizations such as the European Union, there are many other international organizations that are involved in various fields. It is difficult to give a reasonable definition and explanation of world politics without analyzing these organizations, which are an integral part of global politics. D-8, which was established on June 15, 1997 and announced with the Istanbul Declaration, took its place among these international organizations. Among the goals of the organization, with its members Turkey, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Malaysia, Nigeria and Bangladesh that have a total population of over one billion, is to establish a rich trade cooperation and to reach a strong position in world economy. It is aimed to ensure the unity of the oppressed peoples against various embargoes applied to Islamic countries and to represent the rights of all people by participating in international decisions. In this study, Turkey's place and future in the D-8 and whether the D-8 can contribute to the establishment of a new world order will be discussed in terms of International Relations.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of S2 Bean Lines Selected by Selection Breeding in Terms of Yield and Yield Components
Özet: This research was conducted to determine yield and some yield components of 22 local dry S2 bean lines. Study was established in the experimental farm of the Isparta University of Applied Sciences Faculty of Agriculture during the vegetation period of 2021. Önceler 98 and Göynük 98 cultivars were used as control in the experiment. Field experiment was arranged in randomized block design with 3 replications. The significant differences between genotypes were found in all the examined features in the experiment. According to the data obtained; the plant height varied between 24.51 and 68.60 cm., number of pods varied between 15.67 and 58.53, seeds per plant varied between 59.57 and 228.47, the grain yield varied between 2760.03-8620.90 kg/ha, hundred-grain weight varied between 25.25 and 56.86 g and the protein ratio varied between 18.47-24.43%. As a result, some genotypes superior to control cultivars were determined. In terms of grain yield, ISP34, ISP23, BUR14, ISP72, ISP31, BUR20, KON17, KON16 KON5 and ISP 34 lines had higher yield values than the cultivar Önceler 98.

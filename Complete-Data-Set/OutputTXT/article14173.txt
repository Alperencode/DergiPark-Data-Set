Makale Başlığı: FERTILITY CHANGE IN TÜRKİYE: RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF SOCIAL POLICY
Özet: nges can be the decisive factor in the change of total fertility rate. In this context, many developments such as the increase in the educated population, the increase in female employment rates, urbanization, the increase in the rate of people who have never been married, the increase in the average age at first marriage, the use of contraceptives, abortion practices, and the increasing cost of children are directly or indirectly effective in the decrease in the total fertility rate. Within this framework, the “demographic transition process” has been experienced rapidly in Türkiye and fertility has started to decline rapidly in the last fifty years. The decrease in the fertility rate brings many consequences in terms of demographic and socio-economic. The aim of this research is to discuss the causes and consequences of the change in the total fertility rate in Türkiye and to evaluate the possible risks and opportunities that may arise as a result of declining fertility. In the study, the relevant literature was reviewed. In this context, the general view of fertility in the world is evaluated first. Then, Türkiye's fertility change process is explained. As a result, despite the cultural and demographic transformation, it is foreseen that the negative effects of fertility can be mitigated with the policies and technological opportunities.

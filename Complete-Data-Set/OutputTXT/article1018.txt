Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Nepotism on Counterproductive Work Behaviors
Özet: The Aim of this study is to explore the effect of nepotism on counterproductive work behaviors. The research was conducted on the employees of textile companies operating in Kahramanmaraş in 2019. Data were collected by questionnaire method and 482 employees participated in the research. The data obtained were analyzed with the SPSS program and the results were interpreted according to the findings. As a result, it was observed that nepotism had a statistically weak, positive and significant effect on counterproductive work behaviors. Nepotism practices in organizations have a negative effect on employees. For this reason, productivity and performance of enterprises decrease and counterproductive work behaviors increase. There is a need for business managers to combat the factors that cause counterproductive work behaviors and to conduct more comprehensive research in this area.

Makale Başlığı: Acquisition of Own Shares by Corporations Whose Shares Are Traded on the Stock Exchange Within the Framework Shaped by Press Announcements of Capital Markets Board
Özet: The rules for acquisition of own shares by corporations whose shares traded on the stock exchange are specified in capital markets law. Capital Markets Board has enacted II-22.1 Communiqué On Buy-Backed Shares by exercising the power recognised in the Article 22 of Capital Markets Law with the code number 6362. Besides, the Board has adopted two public announcements which render buy-backs applicable in a wider scope for corporations whose shares traded on the stock exchange as an alternative way to buy-backs programs. In 2020, within the measures with respect to capital markets in response to the Covid-19 Outbreak, it is remembered that Board’s public announcements made in 2016 are still in force.Specifying an alternative system for existing legal framework for buy-backs by rendering particular provisions non-applicable in secondary legislation via public announcements is controversial in terms of the preference regarding the type of regulation and the place of liberalization of buy-backs of corporations whose shares traded on the stock exchange within the system as a whole. In this article, it is aimed to examine the current system regarding the acquisition of own shares by corporations whose shares traded on the stock exchange. The content of the press announcements will be revealed after the positive legal rules on the subject are determined first. After that, the alternative and more liberal system brought by the Board via press announcements and the rules for acquiring of own shares for corporations whose shares are traded on the stock exchange will be evaluated in terms of the Board's regulatory powers and effects of the content of the announcements on the practice of buy-backs.

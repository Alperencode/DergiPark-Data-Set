Makale Başlığı: Sleep Habits and Changes in Pregnant Women
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate pregnant women admitted to the outpatient clinic in terms of sleep apnea risk and sleep quality.Materials and Method: 31 women were included in this retrospective descriptive study which were conducted at Obstetrics and Gynecology Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital, between January 2016 and January 2017. Demographic characteristics, results of sleep questionnaires, pulmonary function test values, and information about delivery of the patients were obtained retrospectively for the 8th week and last trimester.Results: The mean sleep time was 7.9±1.3 hours at 8th week and 7.3±2.0 hours at last trimester; with no significant difference in two periods (p=0.077). According to sleep questionnaires there was no statistically significant difference between 8th week and the last trimester (p>0.05), except Stanford Sleepiness Scale score (p=0.047). There was no significant difference according to pulmonary function test values between 8th week and last trimester (p>0.05), there was a statistical difference between two periods only in terms of FEV1% (p=0.047). No significant difference was found between the mean birth weight of babies of 13 pregnant women with poor sleep quality and mean birth weight of babies of 18 pregnant women with good sleep quality (p=0.565).Conclusion: As a result, in our study, nearly half of the pregnant women had impaired sleep quality in the last trimester according to the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, but birth weight was not affected in pregnant women with poor sleep quality. Sleep quality, the presence of OSAS in pregnancy and its relationship with pregnancy and postpartum complications are not clear, OSAS pregnancy studies should be performed especially involving complicated pregnancies.

Makale Başlığı: The Transformation of Kemalism’s Pro-Enlightenment and Laicist Discourse From National Struggle Period to Turkish Republic
Özet: In this study, discourses of cadres, who were among the founders of the Republic of Turkey and close to the ideology would later be defined as ‘Kemalism’, on enlightenment and secularism and changes in these discourses are examined. The study, which is limited to the early republican period, is primarily addresses the sources of Kemalism's pro-enlightenment and laicist approach. In this context, the thought and philosophical movements that influenced Kemalism in local and international fields are explained, in addition how founding cadres tried to adapt these influences to Turkey and the new era is also analyzed. Finally, the change in the pro-enlightenment and laicist discourse of Kemalism is scrutinized, and it is shown that the said discourse differs when a comparison made between discourses of 1919-1924 era and post-1924 era.The aim of the study is to reveal that Kemalism's pro-enlightenment and laicist discourse had opposing aspects between the period 1919-1924 and the period after 1924 -at least at the discursive level, if not in essence- and that the main factor determining this opposition was the condensation of power struggles. Between 1919 and 1924, a more moderate and compromising secular discourse was being used in order to gain the support of Islamic countries and to build legitimacy in the eyes of the people, for the struggle against imperialism and especially the Istanbul Government, which had the trump of the caliphate. With the abolition of the caliphate after 1924, this attitude has been abandoned and a more evident laicist language was used for the construction of a modernist-nationalist society.The study leaves out institutional arrangements for the implementation of laicism during the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, enacted laws and similar activities related to the establishment of the new regime. Although historical data and developments will be referenced occasionally, only Mustafa Kemal's and his close circle’s discourses and expressions will be maintained as a basis for analysis.

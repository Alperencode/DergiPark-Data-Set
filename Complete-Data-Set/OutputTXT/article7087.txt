Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Results and Their Potential Factors Among Local Population and Refugees
Özet: Objective: Over five million refugees have been migrated to Turkey due to the current developments there. Language problems, high number of unregistered refugees, economic reasons, and unemployment in the refugee population makes it difficult for them to receive quality health care and may cause patients to apply to the hospital with more complicated diseases. This study aimed to evaluate surgical results and complications between the local population and refugee patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated who underwent PNL in two different healthcare centers between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. The patients were divided into two groups as "Local Population" and "Refugees" and were compared with each other.Results: The stone burden was significantly higher in refugee population (466.8 mm2 & 1107.4 mm2, p<0.01). On evaluation of time in terms of fluoroscopy, operation, period until the removal of nephrostomy tube, and hospitalization, the patients of local population had significantly lower values.Conclusion: The size of kidney stones and stone burden were observed to be larger and the success rate was significantly lower in the refugee patient group.

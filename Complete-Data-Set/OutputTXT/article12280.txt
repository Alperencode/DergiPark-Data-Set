Makale Başlığı: Why Do Pre-Service Teachers Who Believe In The Necessity Of Proof Have Low-Level Self-Efficacy With The Proof?
Özet: Abstract – This research aimed to examine the opinions of pre-service mathematics teachers towards proof. The students received low scores in the items containing the self-evaluation of the proof in the quantitative dimension, a qualitative form was applied to obtain more comprehensive information. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative research approaches were used together along with mixed methods. Although all students expressed their opinions on the necessity of proof, it was concluded that they had difficulties in the proof process due to the difficulty level of proof and their lack of mathematical knowledge in their self-evaluation. And also, a great majority of pre-service teachers stated that they intended to use alternative learning approaches instead of proof in their future careers. Although proof is seen as a necessary process, pre-service teachers' proof self-efficacy levels are low and their thoughts on using proof in their professional life are insufficient. Therefore, it can be recommended to include proof in pre-graduate education and to eliminate the students' lack of basic knowledge.

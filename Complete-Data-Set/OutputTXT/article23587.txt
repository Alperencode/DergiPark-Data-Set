Makale Başlığı: From Difference to Differences: Reviewing Theories of Women’s Autobiography and Contextualizing the Concept of Métissage
Özet: As a self–referential genre, autobiography explores the relationship between the “self” of the narratorand the “self” in the world. Based on this explication of “self,” theorists of autobiography differ. Autobiographyflourished in the West from the Westerner’s belief in the concept of the Renaissance individual that takes itsinception in the Cartesian philosophy, which correlates “self” with “the thinking subject,” capable of producingmeaning, knowledge, and truth. From this humanist look, while the male critics like George Gusdorf, JamesOlney read autobiography as a journey towards a self-understanding of the subject as individual and unique,women critics find the “self” split and textually produced. The present paper focuses on how women startedvoicing the difference of female subjectivity in terms of gender experience and how considering the context ofrace, gender, class, sexuality, location, and many other hallmarks, postmodern critics advanced towardsarticulating the “poetics of differences”. Moreover, reading Francois Lionnet’s concept of métissage in relationto other postmodern theories of women’s autobiography, the paper argues métissage as the culmination oftheorizing differences regarding subjectivity and representation strategy

Makale Başlığı: A Panoramic View at the Life of ʿArīb al-Ma’mūnīyya on the Road from Odalisque to Reputation
Özet: Odalisques, who were considered among slaves, were bought and sold in the markets. They have been preferred for many purposes, such as serving housework and singing in entertainment conventions. While some of the odalisques got privileges as spouses to the caliphs, some of them got privileges due to their character and abilities. Arīb al-Maʾmūniyye, which is the issue of this research, draws attention with both her talents and the narrations about her life and life. In the research, all the findings about her life were tried to be revealed through the sources. In fact, Arîb, who was not a odalisque, was the hidden side of Caʻfer al- Barmakid. Caʻfer al- Barmakid's child Arîb, from his wife named Fātima, passed into the hands of slave traders after the Barmakids. Arīb, who was the odalisque of Maʾmūn after caliph Emīn, was attributed to Maʾmūn because he loved her very much. Arīb, who was treated as a odalisque until the time of Muʻtasim, gained his freedom when Muʻtasim released him. In the study, it was determined that she was not an ordinary odalisque with her talents, political power and political influence. The subject is discussed through the life of Arīb, the evaluation of false rumors, her economic and political situation, her scientific aspect and her place in Arabic literature.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Some Environmental Factors on Cocoon Quality Properties in Farms Reared Silkworm Breeding in Diyarbakir
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of some environmental characteristics measured in enterprises in Kulp district of Diyarbakır province on the cocoon yield and quality characteristics, and to determine the cocoon quality parameters according to the operating capacities. Statistically significant differences were found between the grouped enterprises in terms of humidity and temperature (P<0.05). In the study, cocoon yield was 31.6±1.5 kg. From cocoon quality properties fresh cocoon weight (g), fresh cocoon weight without pupa (g), dry cocoon weight (g), dry cocoon weight without pupa (g), cocoon length (cm), cocoon width (cm), cocoon shell ratio (%), filament length, filament denier (den), single cocoon weight (g), the cocoon weight of the part that cannot be withdrawn from the cocoon (g), dry cocoon yield compared to wet boll (%), cocoon quantity per liter; cocoon amount in kg, the rate of faulty cocoon (%) were 1.92±0.06,  0.41±0.02, 0.73±0.03, 0.37±0.02, 3.41±0.05, 1.89±0.03, 21.3±0.6, 1222±35, 2.76±0.08, 0.365±0.014, 0.03±0.005, 38.5±1.7, 67±3, 547.15±22 and 18.7±1.6, respectively. When the relationship between environmental characteristics and cocoon quality characteristics is examined; negative correlation was found between carbon dioxide ratio and cocoon shell ratio (r= -0.560) (P<0.05).

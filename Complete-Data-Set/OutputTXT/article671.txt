Makale Başlığı: Production Methods of D-Allulose
Özet: Rare sugars are of great interest as alternative sweeteners because they are beneficial for human health and have a high industrial value. The existence of rare sugars in nature in very limited quantities has encouraged studies to convert common sugars obtained from plants into rare sugars by enzymatic, chemical or other methods. D-allulose, which has a very important place among rare sugars, is a sugar that stands out with its low calorie and sweetness very close to sucrose. It has the ability to regulate many biological functions such as lowering blood glucose level, improving insulin resistance, reducing fat accumulation in the body and reducing fever, as well as having high solubility and positive effects on food tissue, making the use of this sugar more efficient in food processing. D-allulose is known as "indigestible carbohydrate". It occurs naturally in many fruits and beverages and some cereal products. Today, D-allulose can be produced in many ways such as plant extraction, chemical synthesis, enzymatic conversion and can be safely used in the production of some foodstuffs. In this review, D-allulose production methods are presented, differences in these methods and their advantages and disadvantages are compared to each other.

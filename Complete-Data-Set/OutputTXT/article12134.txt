Makale Başlığı: The use of width measurements taken from the upper face and orbital regions in sex determination
Özet: Objective: The face is one of the anatomical parts that is crucial in terms of sex estimation. By focusing on the upper face region, the goal of this study is to find an answer to the question of whether the relatively under-examined breadth measures can be employed in sex estimation.Method: In order to achieve this aim, 5 width measurements were taken on CT (computerized tomography) images of 200 adult individuals (100 women, 100 men) aged between 18 and 75. These measures are: (1) bimalar (interzygomatic) width, (2) bizygomaxillary width, (3) orbital width, (4) biorbital width, and (5) interorbital width. The degrees of sexual dimorphism of the measures were analyzed by constructing univariate and multivariate discriminant functions.Results: The ratio of correct allocation of sex by univariate functions ranged from 63.5% to 76.5%. It was determined that the variables that best the discriminator of sex were bimalar (interzygomatic) width (76.5%) and biorbital width (73%), respectively. The function contains bimalar width and orbital width was the most successful multivariate equation in properly differentiating the sexes, with a sex determination rate of 77%.Conclusion: Findings reveal that the success of the width measurements in the upper face and orbital region is at a moderate level, therefore, in the medico-legal examinations the width measurements of the upper face region can be applied in cases where the bone elements forming the pelvis are not found.

Makale Başlığı: Clinical Significance of Spleen Size and Hematological Parameters in COVID-19 Patients
Özet: Objective: COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes systemic involvement and the spleen may be one of the target organs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of spleen size and laboratory parameters in computed tomography (CT) sections taken during hospital admission of COVID-19 patients on the outcome of COVID-19.Material-Method: This retrospective cohort study included 644 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between April and December 2020. The medical records of the patients were collected, and the thorax CT scans in which the entire spleen could be evaluated in the thorax CT sections taken at the time of admission were reviewed.Results: The study population included 644 patients (387 men, 257 women) with a median age of 59 (45 – 69 years). The three most common systemic diseases associated with COVID-19 were hypertension (28%), diabetes mellitus (22.2%), and heart disease (18.6%). The most common active complaints at admission were shortness of breath (57.5%) and cough (46%). 109 of 644 patients were mortal. At admission, patients with mortality had higher median leukocyte count (8.9 vs 6.5, p<0.001), lymphocyte count (1.3 vs 1.0, p<0.001) and platelet count (187 vs 200, p=0.001). 0.035) was higher in patients without mortality. Of the study population, 173 (26.9%) had splenomegaly, and the rate of splenomegaly was significantly higher in patients without mortality (31% vs. 6.4%, p<0.001).Conclusion: Although COVID-19 manifests itself with lung involvement especially in the early period, it also causes systemic involvement and one of the target organs may be the spleen. In addition, the lymphocyte, monocytes and platelet counts of the patients at the time of admission can predict the progression of COVID-19. The results of our study suggest that increased spleen size may be a marker that should be considered in terms of COVID-19 outcome.

Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF IMF-SUPPORTED REFORM POLICIES BY PROCESS FOLLOW-UP METHOD: THE TURKISH CASE
Özet: Structural problems of the Turkish economy occupied the agenda throughout the 90s and pushed policy makers to seek different solutions to solve these problems. In this study, making agreements with the IMF, which is one of these solutions, has been taken into consideration as an indicator of reform policy. The economic and political conditions in which the IMF-supported reform policies of the 90s emerged are explained using the process monitoring method. According to the results of this method, it has been found that the deterioration in economic activity has an indisputable and significant effect on reforms. Although there was no partisan government effect on the pro-market reforms and stabilization policies during the period examined; It is an obvious fact that communication between the IMF and the government is important in reform decisions. There has also been evidence to support the political business cycle hypothesis. Interestingly, there was evidence confirming the hypothesis that IMF programs cause crises during the period under review.

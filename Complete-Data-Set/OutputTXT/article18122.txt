Makale Başlığı: Automobilizing Masculine Cities and Walking Fluid Feminine Bodies
Özet: Walking in modern cities is a political act. This is because modern cities are the products of dominant power in a way which directly affects the relationships people establish with their bodies. This study engages in a critique of modern urbanism by examining walking as a not only physical, but also mental activity which deepens and intensifies walking subjects' relationships with their bodies. Arguing that modern cities are the products of existing governments and therefore are built to ensure the continuity of the latter's political interests, this study demonstrates how the automobilization of individuals and cities as a result of government interests affects subjects' relationships with their bodies. Eventually, this study will show how the physical and mental activity of walking also becomes a political one in the face of the alienation created by governments.

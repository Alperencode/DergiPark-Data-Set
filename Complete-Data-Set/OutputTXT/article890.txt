Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Agility, Speed, and Aerobic Capacities of Football Referees
Özet: This study aims to determine the referees' and assistant referees' agility, speed, and aerobic capacities. 24 middle and 30 assistant referees participated in the study. The agility assessment was done by Illinois, with sprint tests at 10 meters, 20 meters, and 30 meters. Determination of aerobic capacity was determined by the 20-meter shuttle run method. Independent t-test was used to compare the referees' and assistant referees' agility, speed, and aerobic capacities. According to the results obtained, while assistant referees have significantly higher values than middle referees in agility and 10 meters tests (p<0.001), middle referees have higher values in aerobic capacity evaluation (p=0.012). According to these results, it can be said that the positions of the referees in the field may affect their physical characteristics. It can be stated that the values such as agility, speed, and aerobic capacity of the referees who comply with the football game requirements will differ.

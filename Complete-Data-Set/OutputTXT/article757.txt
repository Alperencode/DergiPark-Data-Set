Makale Başlığı: The State-Religion Relations in Azerbaijan in the 17th – 18th Centuries
Özet: From the 17th to the 18th century, the Afsharid Empire was transitioning from madhhabism to pan-Islamism, advocating Islamic unity and pan-Turkism. The Turkish language served as the language of communication for all peoples and the administrative language in the Empire. The Persian language was also used for official diplomatic correspondence. In the Qajar State, Islam had almost no effect on political governance. During the Azerbaijani khanates, the khan was the ruler pursuing domestic and foreign policy and exercising secular and religious powers. However, he adhered to sharia and national spiritual traditions. High religous class, as a specific social class, actively participated in public life and governance.

Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Different Doses of Thyme and Lavender Oil on Quality Preservation in Apple (cv. Fuji) After Harvest
Özet: Contrary to the shrinking agricultural lands, it becomes very important to minimize the pre-harvest and post-harvest losses in agricultural production due to the constantly increasing population. In this study, thyme and lavender oil were applied to the fruits of the 'Fuji' variety of apple species with high ethylene production, with the aim of minimizing post-harvest losses, and the possibilities of being an alternative to 1-MCP, which is the most widely used commercially, were investigated in terms of results. Although promising results were obtained in the short and medium term in terms of weight loss, the effectiveness of the applications decreased with the increase in storage time. At the end of the 9-month storage period, it was determined that approximately 34.6% of fruit weight loss occurred in the control group, while these values were determined as 23.6%, 26.4% and 27.5% in the promising 400 ppm thyme, 500 and 600 ppm lavender applications, and similar results were obtained with 1-MCP (27.5%). Titratable acidity (TEA), which was determined as 0.33% before storage, showed a regular decrease during the storage period and was measured as 0.13% at the end of the storage period in the control group. As expected, the water-soluble dry matter increased in the early period of storage and decreased continuously afterwards. In line with the nine-month storage results, it was concluded that 400 ppm thyme and 500 ppm lavender applications are promising in minimizing the loss of SÇKM and TEA. In terms of all the properties examined, it can be said that 400 ppm thyme and 500 ppm lavender applications can be alternatives to 1-MCP in order to reduce post-harvest losses.

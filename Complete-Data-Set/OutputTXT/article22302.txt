Makale Başlığı: From a dermatologist point of view, enthesopathy and peripheral neuropathy in psoriasis patients
Özet: Background: Investigating psoriasis patients’ enthesopathy and peripheral neuropathy, which dermatologists often neglect.Methods: Seventy-four psoriasis patients’ lower limb entheses were evaluated by ultrasonography using Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring Scale (GUESS). Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies in median and ulnar nerve, motor nerve conduction research of peroneal and tibial nerves and sensory conduction study on right sural nerve was performed in 25 patients.Results: 172 of 730 entheses had ultrasonographic enthesopathy symptoms (23.56%). Enthesopathy was substantially more common in cases involving the nail (p = 0.004). The frequency of enthesopathy did not change significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.408). Seven of 25 patients (28%) had a pathology in nerve conduction studies. With increasing GUESS scores, bilateral ulnar and right tibial nerve distal motor latencies were shown to become longer (p = 0.001, p = 0.01, p =0.019), although left ulnar nerve sensory conduction velocity got slower (p = 0.033).Conclusions: Enthesopathy and peripheral nerve dysfunction were frequently observed in psoriasis patients. Dermatologists should be mindful of neuromusculoskeletal disorders in psoriasis patients.

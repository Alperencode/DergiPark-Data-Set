Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF URBAN OPEN AND GREEN SPACES WITH A WOMEN-FRIENDLY CITY APPROACH: THE CASE OF EFELER / AYDIN
Özet: Every individual in the society has the right to use and benefit from urban open and green spaces. All over the world and in our country, the ways in which urban open and green spaces are used by various layers of society and the factors affecting the motivation of using these spaces are at the core of livability and sustainability issues. Many factors such as the location of an urban open and green space in the city, the architectural characteristics of the surrounding area, and the different possibilities of use it offers to people, its accessibility and safety are effective on the use or (not) ability of different segments of the society to use these areas. As in all societies, the concept of gender equality in accessing various opportunities and services in Turkish society is always considered as a subject open to discussion. In this context, in this study, the sample parks selected in Aydın province Efeler district were evaluated with a woman-friendly city approach; and planning and design proposals for the future were proposed.

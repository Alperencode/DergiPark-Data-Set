Makale Başlığı: Effects of Levamisole Application on Immunity System in Anthrax-Vaccinated Cattle
Özet: The present study investigated the effect of levamisole administration on the immune system of anthrax-vaccinated cattle. Totally, 40 healthy cattle were employed in the study. Cattle were divided into 4 even groups. In the control group, saline was subcutaneously injected four times as a placebo, every three days, and one dose was administered on the 10th day. In the second group (vaccine group), anthrax vaccine was administered subcutaneously on the 10th day following the administration of physiological saline three times every three days. The 3rd group (vaccine-levamisole) was subcutaneously administered levamisole at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg three times with three-day intervals and on the following 10th day, anthrax vaccine was administered. The 4th group (levamisole) was subcutaneously administered levamisole at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg three times with three-day intervals and physiological saline was subcutaneously injected on the following 10th day. After vaccination neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes count, and the serum IgG amount of the vaccine-levamisole group were found to increase significantly (p<0.05) compared to the vaccine-only group. It was concluded that subcutaneously administered levamisole at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg three times with three-day intervals before administrating the anthrax vaccine to cattle, had a stimulating effect on the immune system.

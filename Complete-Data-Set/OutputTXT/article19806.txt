Makale Başlığı: Alarming Results of the Spatial Attention on Pilot’s Aptitude Testing
Özet: Among safety policies and protocols, which the civil aviationauthorities anticipate in order to achieve and maintain priorinvolvement in monitoring and/or observing behavioral construction,there is a fundamental action. The authority requires to know whethera candidate has the base line capability of bearing and fulfilling therequirements of the physical and mental pressures of the job onstudent pilot candidate election programs. IATA’s pilot aptitude testingneed and guidance declares that the student pilot candidate electionprograms should contain such parameters that a student pilotcandidate must succeed through (IATA,2019). We operated a testprotocol which was compatible with IATA’s demand of competence ona student pilot candidate. With the predetermined success rates ofevery test protocol battery, we provided results of the tests of spatialattention, with regarding to the feedback from personality test, spatialattention, spatial disorientation, perceptional focusing & memory,spatial aptitude, decision making under stress, team work &leadership. We analyzed the results of the tests and the spatialattention sufficiency requirement has the least success rate in themidst of basic abilities and sophisticated skills which a student pilotcandidate has to have. Among the 78 student pilot candidates, 38 pilotcandidates have failed from the pilot aptitude testing’s spatialattention sufficiency parameter.

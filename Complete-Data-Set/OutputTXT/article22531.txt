Makale Başlığı: Institution-Building on Shop-floor Employees’ Representation with Reference to International Norms and Representative Industrial Democracy: A First Attempt to Model Dual-channel Representation in Turkey
Özet: This article explores the feasibility of setting up a shop-floor social dialogue mechanism in Turkey based on the synthesis of EU Directive (2002/14/EC), the German works council model and various dimensions of Turkish labour law and practice. Evaluating the outputs of the questionnaire conducted between the years 2015-2016 and addressed to selected samples of representatives of labour unions and employers’ organizations as well as to officials of the Turkish Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the article proposes two alternatives for a dual-channel representation system: namely, the establishment of works councils to co-exist with unions and the election of employee representatives. Since the majority of Turkey’s workplaces are currently unrepresented by unions, it is assumed that either option may serve the objectives of adapting Turkish labour relations to international standards and locating representative industrial democracy at the core of work life.

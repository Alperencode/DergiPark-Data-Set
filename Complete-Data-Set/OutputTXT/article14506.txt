Makale Başlığı: TURKEY’S MIDDLE EAST POLICY IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA (1991-2011): FROM SECURITY-ORIENTED APPROACH TOWARDS COOPERATION
Özet: This article aims to study the basic factors shaping Turkey’s Middle East policy, the main instruments to realize Turkey’s goals and determine the outcomes of these policies in three periods (1991-1997, 1997-2002 ve 2002-2011) in a detailed manner. Due to the threats posed from the Middle East region, security-fist approach has dominated Turkey’s perspective towards the region between 1991 and 1997. Between 1997 and 2002, with the effect of İsmail Cem who was advocating Ankara should take steps to overcome the problems in relations with the region, Turkey adopted a vision to construct a relation model based on cooperation with the countries of the region. Between 2002 and 2011, under Ak Parti administration, Turkey approached its policy towards the Middle East upon constructing mutual cooperation, activating and strengthening economic relations, reviving historical and cultural ties and contributing to peace through regional stability. Moving forward from this point, this article sets forth that during these periods Turkey’s Middle East policy reflects radical and comprehensive changes in terms of foreign policy discourse, instruments and goals.Since the process is continuing and due to limitation of the study, post-Arab Spring period has not been included to the scope of the study.

Makale Başlığı: Thermodynamic Properties of Binary Liquid Mixtures Containing Furfural with Chlorobenzene, Nitromethane, Diethylmalonate and 1-Butanol at 308.15K and 318.15K Supported by FTIR Spectral Studies
Özet: A study on thermodynamic properties of the liquid mixture is used in the industrial process, which often extends to solution chemistry. Density(ρ), Viscosity(η), and Ultrasonic velocity(U) were determined for binary liquid mixtures of furfural with chlorobenzene, nitromethane, diethyl malonate and 1- butanol at temperature of 308.15K and 318.15K at atmospheric pressure over the whole range of mole fractions. The calculated thermodynamic properties and some excess parameters such as Excess Volume(VE), Deviation in Isentropic Compressibility(∆KS), Deviation in Viscosity(∆η), Deviation in Intermolecular Free Length(∆LF), Deviation in Intermolecular Free Volume(∆VF), Deviation in Internal Pressure(∆π) and Deviation in Acoustic Impedance(∆Z) were calculated and applied to the Redlich-Kister type polynomial equation to determine the appropriate coefficients. The effects of composition and temperature on thermodynamic parameters have been studied in terms of molecule interaction in these liquid mixtures. Further, IR spectra of these liquid mixtures were recorded and the data were utilized to examine the mixing behavior of the components.

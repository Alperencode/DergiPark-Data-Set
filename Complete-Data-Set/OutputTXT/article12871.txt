Makale Başlığı: Development of public administration education in Kyrgyzstan and current situation analysis
Özet: Kyrgyzstan, which gained its independence in 1991 and passed to a democratic administration system, initiated a comprehensive reform process regarding the public administration system and implemented various legal regulations. Qualified personnel in public institutions were urgently needed for the smooth operation of the established public administration system and the reforms' success. In line with this need, departments that will train staff who can work in central government and local government bodies have started to be opened in higher education institutions. Over time, both the number of universities opened and the number of public administration departments increased. Today, 8 out of 51 universities in total accept students in public administration in undergraduate and graduate programs. This study is aimed to reveal the emergence, development, and current situation of the public administration departments in the Kyrgyz Republic, which are very important for the development of a country.

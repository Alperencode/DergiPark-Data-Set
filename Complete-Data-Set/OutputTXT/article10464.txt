Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Seroprevalences of Vaccine Preventable Diseases in Children Admitted to a Regional Training and Research Hospital
Özet: Objective: In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the seroprevalences of measles, rubella, mumps, varicella, hepatitis A and B in patients that were admitted to a regional training and research hospital.Material and Methods: This study is a retrospective patient file scan. Age, gender, adherence to the vaccination schedule, and antibody levels for measles, rubella, mumps, varicella, hepatitis A and B were recorded. Data were presented in terms of number, percentage, mean and standard deviation. Chi-square and t-test were used for the statistical analysis of the data.Results: The mean age of the patients was 9.35±3.78 years (range 2.4 –16 years). For measles, rubella, mumps and varicella, incidences for vaccination were 89%, 79%, 65.5% and 15.5% while seropositivity rates were 78.5%, 87.5%, 63.5% and 81.5% respectively. HAV-IgG was positive in 143 (44.9%) patients. Seropositivity for hepatitis B was found in 231 (72.9%) patients; isolated anti-HBs positivity was found in 156 (67.9%) patients while anti-HBs positivity with anti-HBc IgG positivity was found in 75 (32.1%) patients.Conclusion: In the present study, seroprevalences of vaccine preventable diseases in patients who were admitted to a research and training hospital were evaluated for a one-year period and in general the seropositivity rates were found to be between 70-80%. The higher seronegativity rates for rubella and mumps could be related to the fact that these vaccines were added to the national vaccine program later on than measles and also awareness should be increased about these two vaccine preventable diseases.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Important Quality Components of Some Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) Genotypes Grown as Main Crop
Özet: This research was carried out to determine the important quality factors in 12 peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) genotypes grown as the main crop in Kahramanmaraş province conditions. The study was carried out in Kahramanmaraş conditions in 2016. The study was conducted at randomized complete block design with three replications. In the study carried out, the ratios of saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids were investigated. Besides these; quality factors such as oleic acid / linoleic acid ratio, which is one of the oil stability values, iodine value, unsaturated/saturated oil ratio, oil yield and protein yield were also investigated. As a result of the study, peanut genotypes; The values of some important properties examined, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and oleic/linoleic acid ratio, iodine value, unsaturated/saturated oil ratio and yield, and protein yield, respectively; It was determined that it varied between 44.811-81.787 %, 3.955-36.066 %, 1.109-1.465 %, 1.242-20.677 %, 77.197-101.012 % and 4.751-7.773 %, 112.295-199.818 kg da-1 and 56.311-105.204 kg da-1. Differences between genotypes were found to be very significant (P<0.01) for all traits studied.Osmaniye-2005 variety is recommended for obtaining the highest oil (199.818 kg da-1) and protein yield (105.204 kg da-1) in Kahramanmaraş conditions.

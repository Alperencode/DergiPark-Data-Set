Makale Başlığı: Inscriptions Signed by Calligrapher  Behçet Arabî in Urfa Architecture
Özet: The leading role in the formation of a work of art undoubtedly belongs to the artist. In addition to his imagination, skill and style, the culture of the city where he lives also has a share in shaping the artist's work. Behçet Arabî, one of the important representatives of calligraphy, also has the influence of the city Urfa where he lives. So much so that in a large part of his calligraphy works, he completed the signature of “Ketebehû Behcet Arabî” with the word “Urfa” and made this effect traceable and permanent.In this study, the inscriptions in Urfa where Behçet Arabî's biography and signature are included were examined. Literature review, field research and oral history are among the methods of the study. In the context of oral history, a personal interview was held with Behçet Arabî's student Calligrapher Mahmut Dörtbudak and new findings were reached about Arabî's biography. In addition, the inscriptions signed by Behçet Arabî in 9 buildings in the Eyyübiye and Haliliye districts of Şanlıurfa were identified and evaluated within the framework of calligraphy.The buildings where the artist’s signature can be determined are Abamor Mosque, Arabî Mosque, Hasan Padishah (Hasan Pasha) Mosque, Mevlid-i Halil (Dergâh) Mosque, Fırfırlı Mosque, Ubeydullah Mosque, Urfa Grand Mosque, Yeni Arabî Mosque and Yenişehir Mosque. As a result of the research, it was concluded that Behçet Arabî contributed to the architecture of Urfa and the signature tradition in the city

Özet: Objective: In the present study, it was aimed to determine the sport-related injury region, injury type, maneuver and fall direction that caused the injury, protective equipment usage, and perceived injury risks in competitive and recreational motocross athletes.Materials and Methods: Seventy-three athletes (mean age: 38.98±8.88 years, mean body weight: 78.38±13.73 kg, mean height: 175.28±6.50 cm) participated in this crosssectional study. An online questionnaire including training information, traumatic and overuse injury history, protective equipment usage habits, and perceived injury risks was applied to the participants.Results: Post-driving wrist pain (42.47%) was mostly reported pain due to overuse by the athletes. Injuries following acute trauma were mostly detected in the shoulder (31.50%) and knee (31.50%) joints. The most common injury type was fracture (90.41%). Athletes were injured mostly with the jumping maneuver (30.13%) and fell to the right side (41.09%). Helmet (67.12%) was stated as the most used protective equipment, and ground conditions (52.05%) were the most reported perceived risk factor.Conclusion: Motocross athletes are frequently exposed to injuries. In line with our results, it was recommended to develop equipment materials with higher protection, especially for the shoulder and knee joints.

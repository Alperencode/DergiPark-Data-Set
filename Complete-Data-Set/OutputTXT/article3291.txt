Makale Başlığı: Harith ibn Jabala’s visit to Constantinople: The Ghassanid-East Roman Relations Between Religion and Foreign Policy
Özet: The purpose of this article is to examine Harith ibn Jabala’s two visits to Constantinople, the most famous ruler of the Ghassanids, at the beginning and end of the reign of emperor Justinian. According to sources, Harith who came to the Eastern Roman capital with an official invitation was greeted with a large ceremony and on his first visit, Justinian gave him the title of phylarkhos, which means “head of a tribe or local potentate”. His second visit to Constantinople took place in 563. One of the most important results of these visits was, in contrast to sharp religious differences between Justinian and Harith, the appointment of the famous Monophysite leader Jacob Baradaeus as the bishop of Edessa by a diophysite pro-Chalcedon Eastern Roman emperor. This was no doubt a result of the positive atmosphere in the political-military relations between the Ghassanids and the East Rome in the face of the Sasanid threat from the east. Therefore this appointment was not without reason, because the main motivation behind Harith’s visit and his new title was to strengthen the alliance between the Eastern Roman and the Ghassanids against the disturbingly growing power of the Sassanids in Syria.

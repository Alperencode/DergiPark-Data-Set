Makale Başlığı: Prevalence of rotavirus-adenovirus positivity: 5-year retrospective evaluation
Özet: Background: In our study, we aimed to determine the frequency of rotavirus and adenovirus in patients admitted to our hospital.Materials and Methods: Rotavirus and adenovirus antigens were studied with the immunochromatographic cassette test method in stool samples that came to Malatya Training and Research Hospital Microbiology Laboratory between January 2015 and December 2019, and the results were evaluated retrospectively.Results: Viral antigens were detected in 15288 (12.1%) of 126124 stool sample in the study. 13706 (89.7%) were detected as rotavirus and 1582 (10.3%) as adenovirus in the positive samples. When the adenovirus and rotavirus positivity rates were examined, the difference between the genders was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Adenovirus positivity was found significantly higher in between 0-2 years of age compared to patients that older than 2 years (p<0.001).Conclusions: We believe that the appropriate treatment to be applied as a result of the accurate and rapid determination of the etiology of diarrhea will significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity rates.

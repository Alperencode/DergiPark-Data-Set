Makale Başlığı: Determination of Toxoplasmosis Frequency by Real-Time PCR in Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital
Özet: Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that can infect humans and warm-blooded animals. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the frequency of toxoplasmosis in clinical samples taken from various patient groups. Within the scope of the study, a total of 535 clinical samples, including mainly amniotic fluid, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples, which were sent to the Molecular Parasitology laboratory of Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Parasitology between 2009 and 2019, were evaluated.The frequency of toxoplasmosis was determined as 2.61% (14/535) in the specified time period. While the positivity rate was 5.40% (8/148) in the samples taken from the central organs directly affected by the disease, the positivity rate was 1.74% (5/286) in the samples taken from the periphery, and this difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Although the positivity rate of the disease was higher in immunosuppressive patients, no statistically significant difference was found (P>0.05).The findings show that Real-Time PCR method has a very important place in the diagnosis of active toxoplasmosis. In addition, it was concluded that sampling methods are very important in the diagnosis of the disease.

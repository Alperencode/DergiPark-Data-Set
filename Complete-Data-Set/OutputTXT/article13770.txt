Makale Başlığı: CLINICAL, SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE ORAL-HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN WITH MALOCCLUSION
Özet: Background: The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the socio-demographic, clinical and behavioral factors affecting the oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) in preschool children with malocclusion.Methods: This study was carried out with 113 children (30-to-71 months) and their parents attending to the clinics of the Pediatric Dentistry Department at Istanbul University. Data were collected through clinical examinations and a questionnaire including the Turkish version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS), socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney-U test, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and the multiple linear stepwise regression analysis. Results: In the bivariate analyses, significant positive correlations were found among the number of decayed and filled teeth, the scores for the total ECOHIS and its child and family sections. It was found that children with distal plane and deep bite malocclusion and those with non-nutritive sucking habit had better oral health-related quality of life than those without. In the regression analysis, having a habit related to malocclusion, presence of dental caries and increasing child age were determined as factors that decreased the child-related quality of life and explained 17.1% of the total variance. Conclusion: It was determined that periodontal status and malocclusion type did not adversely affect oral health-related quality of life in children. The number of dental caries and filled teeth, having parafunctional habits, child's age and attendance at educational institution were identified as important determinants affecting oral health-related quality of life of children.

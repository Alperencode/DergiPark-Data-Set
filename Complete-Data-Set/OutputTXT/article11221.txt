Makale Başlığı: Systemic immune-inflammation index and other inflammatory parameters in patients receiving biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs for inflammatory rheumatic disease
Özet: Objective: To investigate the short – and long-term dynamics in inflammation markers [systemic immune-inflammation index (SII),neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte/ monocyte ratio (LMR)] before and afterbiological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) treatment.Patients and Methods: Two hundred twenty-six patients (115 women, 47±13.8 years) were included. Age, gender, disease duration, andtreatments were recorded retrospectively. Complete blood counts including neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, monocyte and acutephase reactants were noted at the visit before the biological treatment, at the 3rd month, 6th month, and the last visit on medication.SII, NLR, PLR and LMR were calculated, and their dynamics over time were compared.Results: Significant changes were observed over time in all parameters reflecting inflammation (SII, NLR, PLR, LMR, ESR, and CRP)(p<0.05). In the correlation analysis of changes at baseline and six months, significant correlations with ΔESR were observed withΔCRP, ΔPLR, ΔSII and ΔNLR (p<0.05), but no correlation with LMR was detected. Also, significant correlations with ΔCRP werenoted with ΔNLR, ΔSII, ΔPLR, and ΔLMR (p<0.05).Conclusion: Significant and favourable changes were observed in all inflammatory parameters after treatment, and this variationremained stable as long as the drug was continued.

Makale Başlığı: Endoscopic ultrasonography guided endoscopic necrosectomy in the treatment of walled-off pancreatic necrosis: Case report
Özet: In the late stages of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, walled-off pancreatic necrosis is a serious local complication. Infection of the necrotic component of walled-off pancreatic necrosis can result in life-threatening complications. Half of the patients may develop symptoms related to pressure, infection, gastric outlet, and biliary obstruction. Moreover, organized necrotic material should be drained from symptomatic patients. In the early years, while open surgery is the standard treatment for walled-off pancreatic necrosis, it is associated with a rate of high morbidity and mortality. As a result, the use of open surgery has declined as less invasive methods, such as radiological and endoscopic procedures, have become more common. In recent years, endoscopic techniques and accessories, especially endoscopic ultrasonography, have revolutionized the endoscopic treatment of peripancreatic fluid collections. Endoscopic methods are favored over other methods because they are associated with lower morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay. In this case report, we present a patient with walled-off pancreatic necrosis who underwent endoscopic ultrasonography -guided transluminal drainage and endoscopic necrosectomy.

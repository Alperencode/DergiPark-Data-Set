Makale Başlığı: In Twin Pregnancies, Zinc and Iron Decreased, while Copper Increased Minimally
Özet: Objective: Along with the increase in the frequency of multiple pregnancies, an increase is observed in the frequency of feto-maternal negativities. In our study, we aimed to determine the iron, ferritin, hemoglobin, zinc, and copper levels in second-trimester multiparous twin pregnancies and compare them with the values in singleton pregnancies and healthy women with the same demographic characteristics.Methods: Three groups were created in the study; control group, single pregnancy group, and twin pregnancy group. Fasting venous blood samples were taken from individuals. Iron, zinc, copper, and ferritin levels were measured.Results: Compared with the control group, the ferritin (Fe), and zinc (Zn) values of the individuals in the single and twin pregnancy groups were statistically low while copper (Cu) levels were significantly high (p<0.05). Also, when compared with individuals in a single pregnancy group, a statistically significant decrease was found in Fe, and Zn levels in the twin pregnancy group (p<0.05). Although there was a minimal increase in Cu levels, this increase was not statistically significant in the twin pregnancy group.Conclusion: Since changes in trace element levels can lead to feto-maternal adverse effects, we think that dietary habits should be monitored, and zinc, copper, ferritin, and iron levels should be followed in pregnant women.

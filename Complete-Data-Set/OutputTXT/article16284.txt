Makale Başlığı: Hearing Loss Due to The Mumps: Case Report and Review
Özet: Childhood hearing loss has a profoundly negative impact on speaking, language learning, intellectual development, and school achievement. In this review of a 12-year follow-up case with unilateral hearing loss due to mumps, we aimed to contribute to further studies by determining the role of mumps-associated hearing loss in the literature. A 20-year-old male patient had a sudden onset of hearing loss with fever and pain after 2 days of going out in cold weather when he was 8. He was diagnosed with almost total unilateral hearing loss due to mumps. We evaluated the literature and studies related to our topic. The most common clinical findings in mumps are parotitis (60-70%), epididymo-orchitis (25%), encephalitis (1-10%), and transient high-frequency hearing loss (4%). Unilateral permanent hearing loss occurs in 1 / 20,000 cases according to the literature review. It has been reported that the mumps virus may lead to almost complete hearing loss and serious complications not only in children but also in adults. Parents should be informed about hearing loss and suspicion of mumps and the priority of vaccination should be emphasized. Since mumps-associated hearing loss may be variable, the evaluation of case reports would be beneficial.

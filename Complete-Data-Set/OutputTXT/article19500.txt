Makale Başlığı: Reflections of Turkish Education Councils to the National Press (1939-1943)
Özet: Along with the National Struggle period in Turkey, attention was paid to educationas in many other subjects. Mustafa Kemal Pasha’s leadership was almost a turning pointin terms of Turkish education history. Various studies have been initiated and continuedto raise the level of education, which can be considered one of the prerequisites for theprogress and westernization of the Turkish nation. The National Education Council, whichis the advisory body of the Ministry of National Education, stands out among theseefforts. This study aims to reveal the reflections of the First Education Council (1939),which took place in 1939, and the Second Education Council (1943) in the national press.In the study, together with the archive documents, the newspapers of the period (Akşam,Anadolu, Cumhuriyet, Haber, Tan, Türk Dili, Son Posta, Son Telegraf, Ulus, Vakit, YeniAsır) and the Council reports published by the Ministry of Education were used. However,the inability to reach the archive of Milliyet newspaper is among the limitations ofthe subject.

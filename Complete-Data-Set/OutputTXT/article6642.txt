Makale Başlığı: The Foundation of the Crusader Kingdom of Thessalonica (1204)
Özet: The armies of the Fourth Crusade succeeded in capturing Constantinople on 13 April 1204. Following the seizure of the city, the French and the Venetian Crusaders, who formed the armies of the expedition, organized an election according to the March Pact they had signed inter se in March 1204, in order to appoint the first emperor of the newly founded Latin Empire. Marquis Boniface of Montferrat, as the titular commander of the expedition, was the obvious candidate for the imperial throne. But Count Baldwin of Flanders and Hainaut, whom the Venetians favoured in the election, was chosen emperor, receiving a majority of the votes. However, a decision taken on the eve of the election provided Boniface with considerable land, although he lost the imperial throne. Then, Marquis Boniface claimed the lands of Thessalonica from Emperor Baldwin in return for the lands promised to him, and soon this caused problems between both of them. Nonetheless, thanks to the mediation of the barons in the army and Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, this controversy was solved and Boniface took control over Thessalonica, one of the largest and wealthiest cities of the Byzantine Empire. In consideration of source material, the present study will deal the positions of the candidates in the aforementioned election, principal motives that led Boniface to claim Thessalonica and the struggle he launched to possess the city as well as the events that took place during the founding of this kingdom.

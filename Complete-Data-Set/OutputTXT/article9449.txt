Makale Başlığı: Novel Solutions of Perturbed Boussinesq Equation
Özet: In this article, we have worked on the perturbed Boussinesq equation. We have applied the generalized Kudryashov method (GKM) and sine-Gordon expansion method (SGEM) to the perturbed Boussinesq equation. So, we have obtained some new soliton solutions of the perturbed Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, we have drawn some 2D and 3D graphics of these results by using Wolfram Mathematica 12.

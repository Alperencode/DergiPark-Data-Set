Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF TURKISH PARTICIPATION BANKS WITH PANEL DATA ANALYSIS
Özet: Banks play an important role in the efficient functioning of the financial system. Participation banks, whose importance has been increasing in the banking sector in recent years, provide banking services to their customers in accordance with Islamic principles in the financial intermediation process, making significant contributions to the support of investment and consumption activities in the country and, as a result, to the effective functioning of the banking system. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the influence of bank-specific financial variables on financial performance. For this purpose, data for the period of 2015-2021 regarding 6 participation banks are employed in the study. The results obtained from the panel data regression analyzes indicate that there is a non-linear inverted U-shaped relationship between bank size and profitability performance. In addition, the findings reveal that bank-level variables such as bank capital, non-performing loans, the growth in the funds disbursed and the ratio of the funds disbursed to the funds collected are significant variables in explaining the change in the bank's financial performance.

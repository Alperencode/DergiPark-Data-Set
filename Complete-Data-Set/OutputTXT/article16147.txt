Makale Başlığı: Investigation of mass movements occurring in landslide areas with the help of optical satellite images: A case study in Koyulhisar town
Özet: Landslide, which is accepted as an important type of natural disaster worldwide, is a disaster that has sad consequences by causing loss of life as well as material negative effects such as damaging urbanization, destroying agricultural and forest areas, polluting rivers and waters. For this reason, it is vital to detect mass movements that cause loss of life and property in landslide areas. Today, mass movements in landslide, glacier, dune and earthquake areas can be determined by many methods such as terrestrial measurements, remote sensing and photogrammetric measurements. Surface deformation analyzes can be done by photogrammetry and remote sensing techniques, as well as by on-site measurement and field observation techniques. Each technique has its own advantage and limitation. Although surface deformations are accurately determined in terrestrial measurement methods (geophysical survey, excavation, investigation of tectonic and geomorphological features), obtaining a holistic view requires a lot of labor and time. Remote sensing methods, on the other hand, provide many conveniences such as speed and cost. In this study, slow mass movements occurring in landslide areas were analyzed by using very high resolution optical satellite images and Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI Corr). As a result, various suggestions have been put forward to take necessary precautions in settlements that are risky in terms of landslides.

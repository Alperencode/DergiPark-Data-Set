Makale Başlığı: Could It Be The Negatıve Of Time?
Özet: The present tense suffix “-r, -Ar, -Ir” in Turkish gives a meaning to the verbs to which it is added, including past, present and future. It is a common assumption that the negative conjugation of this suffix, unlike other times, is made with “-mA” in the first singular and plural persons and “-mAz” in other persons. Therefore, in the literatüre, the suffix “-mAz” is called the negative of present tense.In this study, starting from the negative agnominate of a time as a grammatical term, the concepsts of present tense and negativity are mentioned; it is advocated that the invariant and basic functions of morphemes should be considered in agnominating terms. It is aimed to draw attention to the fact that the agnominating made regardless of usage in the “-mAz” suffix creates a contradiction in structure and meaning.

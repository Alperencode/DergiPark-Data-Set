Makale Başlığı: A Cultural Linguistic Analysis Of The Taboos And Euphemisms About Women In Anatolian Dialects
Özet: Language can preserve traces of culture, so analyzing language means analyzing culture. It can be said that there are a number of cultural, mythological, religious and moral reasons in the formation process of taboos (prohibitions). These prohibitions are transformed into linguistic expressions through euphemisms. The concept of woman has been the subject of research for all cultures and disciplines (mythological, sociological, psychological, etc.). Women are mostly subjected to prohibitions in the society they live in and these prohibitions reveal taboos and euphemisms in the context of culture and language.  In this study, by drawing a perspective on the place of women in Turkish culture, the concept of "woman", one of the linguistic taboos, will be discussed in the sample of Anatolian Dialects. Factors such as the way the concept of woman is handled in terms of prohibitions, the use of euphemisms related to women, the beliefs of the society about women, and the social and cultural structure will be examined. In addition, the characteristics of the taboos and euphemisms related to the concept of woman in Anatolian Dialects will be revealed.

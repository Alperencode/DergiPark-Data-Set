Makale Başlığı: LITERATURE AS A TOOL TO DEVELOP READING CULTURE: THE EXAMPLE OF ANNIE SILVESTRO'S BUNNY'S BOOK CLUB
Özet: Reading culture, which is the transformation of the act of reading into a social life style, is an important element that needs to be developed for the cultural development of the society. In order to develop this culture, all tools consisting of intangible and concrete elements that ensure the transfer of culture within the society should be used effectively. One of the most effective of these tools is, of course, literature. Literary works, which include the culture of reading as a theme, mediate the adoption of this culture by the readers. Especially in illustrated literature works for children, the elements that are desired to be gained can be adopted more quickly with the power of both the word and the picture. Bunny's Book Club written by Annie Silvestro and illustrated by Tatjana Mai-Wyss, is one of these works. Within the scope of this study, which aims to examine the adequacy of the work called Bunny's Book Club in terms of gaining reading culture and library habit, the work in question has been examined in a multidimensional way in the axis of library science and basic elements of children's literature. As a result of the study, in which document analysis and content analysis methods were used, it was determined that the work could be considered as a good tool for gaining reading culture and library habit. The book has a good fictional narrative in terms of literature and is a qualified publication in terms of the basic elements of children's literature.Keywords: Reading culture, library habit, illustrated book, Bunny's Book Club, Annie Silvestro

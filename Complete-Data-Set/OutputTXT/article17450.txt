It is socio-economically important to keep the concept of street food, which is a part of the eating and drinking culture, alive for generations.

The diversity of street foods shows itself in the streets, markets and festivals. In this review, street foods are defined with a global perspective, evaluated in terms of food safety and street foods belonging to the Northern Cyprus culture are mentioned.

Makale Başlığı: Effect of Cement C3A Content on Some Fresh State Properties and Compressive Strength of 3D Printing Concrete Mixtures
Özet: In this study, the effect of cement C3A content on some fresh state properties and compressive strength of 3D Printing Concrete (3DPC) was investigated. For this purpose, two series of 3DPC having different amounts of C3A were prepared and the optimum mix design was determined. The optimum mix design of 3DPC was determined according to extrudability and buildability parameters. Mixtures that can be easily pumped from an injection gun are considered to be extrudable. Mixtures that can be printed in three layers and have a smooth surface are chosen as buildable. Time-dependent flow behavior, shapestability, rheological properties and compressive strength of selected 3DPC mixtures were investigated. The rheological properties of the mixtures were determined by monitoring four different viewpoints: static/dynamic yield stress, viscosity and structural build-up. According to the results, it was observed that time-dependent loss of consistency, shape-stability capacity and structural build-up of the mixtures increased by increment in C3A content. However, static and dynamic yield stress and compressive strength of 3DPC decreased. There was no significant change in viscosity values.

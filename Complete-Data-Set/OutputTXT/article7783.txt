Makale Başlığı: Kahramanmaraş Koşullarında Çörek Otu (Nigella Sp.) Genotiplerinde Farklı Sıra Arası Mesafelerin Verim ve Kaliteye Etkilerinin Belirlenmesi
Özet: This study it was aimed to determine the agricultural and quality characteristics of different row distances on N. sativa, N. damascena and N. sativa (Cameli variety) genotypes under Kahramanmaraş conditions. The experiment was carried out in the research and application area of Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam University Faculty of Agriculture, Field Crops Department in the vegetation period of 2019-2020 with 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm inter row distances. The trial was established according to the split plots in randomized blocks as 3 replications. As a result of the study, the genotypes of black seed sown between different rows; plant height 30.25-56.90 cm, first branch height 1.58-15.62 cm, first capsule height 11.52-30.70 cm, the number of branches 5.40-7.10 number plant-1, the number of capsules 8.37-28.37 number plant-1, the number of seeds in the capsule 7.00-26.33 number capsule-1, thousand grain weight 2.18-2.71 g, seed yield 51.39-155.00 kg da-1, fixed oil ratio %28.65-36.40, protein ratio %19.28-22.32, essential oil ratio %0.58-1.12, fixed oil Its yield was 20.36-53.35 kg da-1 essential oil yield was 0.34-1.74 kg da-1. In this study; Cameli variety (N. sativa) as genotype and spacing between rows; statistically in the same group, the highest seed yield was obtained at row spacings of 30 (155.00 kg da-1 seed yield) cm and 20 cm (151.39 kg da-1 seed yield).

Makale Başlığı: The Relationship of Acamprosate and Small Intestine in Alcoholic Rats
Özet: ABSTRACTObjective: Acamprosate, which is used to reduce alcohol use relapse in alcohol use disorder; It was aimed to evaluate its side effects and its effectiveness in the small intestine.Materials and Methods: The related study was carried out on 20.9.2021-25.10.2021. In the study, 32 Wistar Albino female rats were used.  Saline at a concentration of 10 mg/kg/g was given to the control group. The alcohol group received 10 mg/kg/g ethanol diluted with 10 mg/kg/g saline. Acamprosate group received 200 mg/kg/g acamprosate diluted with 10 mg/kg/g saline. In the total group, 10 mg/kg/g ethanol was diluted with 10 mg/kg/g saline before being combined with 200 mg/kg/g acamprosate. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms on the 21st day were studied. The small intestinal tissues were hung in the isolated organ wash on the 22nd day.Results: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome results from both the alcohol and total groups were significant (p<0.001). Small intestine contractions in the alcohol, acamprosate, and total groups were substantially lower than in the control group (p<0.001). When the total group's small intestinal contractions were compared to the alcohol group's, a significant reduction (p<0.001) was detected.Conclusion: It was understood that acamprosate affects the functioning of smooth muscles due to its activity on calcium channels. Acamprosate has been shown to reduce small intestinal contractions and motility. It was also discovered that this impact is stronger than alcohol's contraction-reducing effect.

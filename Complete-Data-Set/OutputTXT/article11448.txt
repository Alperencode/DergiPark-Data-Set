Makale Başlığı: The Representation of Muslim Arab Women by Nike and  Discourse Analysis on Heidegger's Concept of "Das Man"
Özet: Advertisements are one of the media contents shaped by the political authority together with the capitalist market economy. At the same time, advertisements are an impressive tool in the production and reproduction of social structures and cultural codes. This situation is opened to discussion over Nike's commercial (“What will they say about you?”). In this study, it has been problematized in which discourses and representations this advertisement reflects on Muslim Arab women. The advertisement text was analyzed using the critical discourse analysis method according to Norman Fairclough's three-stage model. As a result, in the advertisement were found orientalist representation, pathetic representation and non-existent representation. At the same time, the advertisement created the language of discourse through the third-person plural pronoun "they". For this reason, the term "they" is analyzed by reading Heidegger's concept of "das Man" (they). It has been found that “they” characterize the oppression of patriarchal society shaped within the framework of political power, family, neighbor, social environment, tradition and culture, which are different aspects of power. In addition, it has been revealed that while Nike is positioning itself in opposition to the dominant ideological and traditional structure, it actually supports and reproduces this structure.

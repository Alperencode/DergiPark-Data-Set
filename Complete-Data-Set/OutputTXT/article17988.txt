Makale Başlığı: Approaches to Democratic Regression and Consequences of Regression
Özet: The main source of many secondary problems that have emerged in recent years is the decline of liberal and pluralist democratic understandings and the rise of a kind of populist tendencies. With the decline of liberal democratic norms and the rise of authoritarian demagogue politicians, the world has come under the influence of populism. The real danger is that populism will drag countries back to authoritarian regimes. In this study, three basic concepts, namely illiberal democracy, competitive authoritarianism and political populism, which try to describe the current democratic decline, are discussed in various aspects. In the context of the content of these three basic concepts, the effects and results that emerged in both national and international politics were tried to be revealed. The democratic regression in the world is making societies more introverted. Securitization practices are gaining strength. The principle of separation of powers is gradually eroding in many democratic governments. Politics has a polarizing effect in a climate dominated by hate speech against the other. Similar polarizing and marginalizing effects are seen in international politics. Identity politics, xenophobia and hate speech are gaining strength. Also, the arms race is accelerating and maverick leaders are seen as a threat to international peace. Considering that the internal structures of the states will affect their foreign policies, the weaknesses in democratic administrations and the loss of the functional qualities of democracies will also harm international peace.

Makale Başlığı: 21st Century: The Age of Unlimited Evil
Özet: Human being who has not given up his/her warrior identity throughout history continues her/his same tendency and insensitivity to violence more intensely and more recklessly with new technological opportunities. One of the most distinctive features of the century in which we live in its first quarter is injustice, violence, ruthlessness, in short, evil, which human deems proper to human and as well as to the universe. Unfortunately, no limit, measure or value is accepted in this regard. The 21st century is already a candidate to be the age of unlimited evils. Evil of any kind is almost expected in this age. There is no evil that will no longer be, cannot be. Human’s attack or destruction on human and nature has reached to its most advanced level. Humans harm not only humans, but also nature and every living thing/being in nature. Instead of fulfilling the responsibilities and obligations arising from being a rational being, s/he makes the world uninhabitable by exhibiting an irrational attitude. In order to get out of this state, as Plato said, a person must be formed with high values. In this paper, the examples of unlimited evil peculiar to our age will be emphasized and the possibility of giving up this evil will be discussed.

Makale Başlığı: Entrustment Ethics and Secularism: Taha Abdurrahman’s Perspective
Özet: With an ethical-centered philosophy, Taha Abdurrahman remains one of the most significant and sophisticated Arab philosophers of today. This review article seeks to elaborate on two of his recent books, which builds on and compliments his vision of philosophical independence,, particularly his ‘Entrustment Ethics’ (Al-ʾtimāniya). Throughout two volumes, he aims to construct an ethical philosophy on the foundation of faith, as an alternative to Western ethics. In Volume I Abdurrahman establishes his ethical philosophy that is grounded in what he conceives as three Quranic Covenants: Testimony, establishing man’s responsibility before God, Entrustment, establishing man’s duties and responsibilities on earth, and Transmission, introducing an ideal form of conduct through the role model of God’s Prophets and Messengers. The second volume projects Abdurrahman’s theory on Western established ethical theories and Western ethical and political thought in a broader sense, wherein he both illustrates and critiques theories proposed by thinkers, including, inter alia, Christine Korsgaard, Robert Merrihew Adams, Annette Baier, and John Rawls.

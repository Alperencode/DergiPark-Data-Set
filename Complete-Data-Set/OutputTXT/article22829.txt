Makale Başlığı: Teaching Methods Used to Improve Nursing Students’ Critical Thinking Skills
Özet: Critical thinking is a way of thinking that includes the process of reviewing and evaluating existing information for a good interpretation of the problem before making a decision about a problem. Nurses in healthcare settings often face complex situations that require them to think critically. Therefore, critical thinking in nursing is accepted as a fundamental part of nursing education, research and practice. Critical thinking skills can be gained and developed through education. However, the complex nature of critical thinking skills makes it difficult to acquire this skill through a single teaching method and necessitates the use of different and new approaches. Various teaching methods are tried in nursing education to provide students with critical thinking skills and to develop these skills.

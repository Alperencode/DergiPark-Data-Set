Makale Başlığı: Nusaybin: The Spatial Development of a Border City
Özet: The border between Turkey and Syria has affected the nearby settlements in many ways, primarily in economic, social, and morphological terms. Nusaybin, Kilis, Ceylanpınar, Akçakale, and Karkamış are a few of the cities located on the Turkish side of the border. As the subject of this study, however, Nusaybin differs from other border cities with its unique morphological structure. The border defines Turkey and Syria’s sovereign areas and has shaped the spatial development of Nusaybin city in the south, southwest, and southeast. This study deals with the spatial development of Nusaybin, which turned into a border town with the foundation of the Republic of Turkey. The study evaluates the geographical factors that have affected Nusaybin’s urbanization and spatial evolution, and mainly analyzes the effects the border between Turkey and Syria have had on Nusaybin’s morphological landscape and urban land use from 1923 to the present. The study also talks about the effects urban transformations have had on spatial development and population growth, using historical records, photographs, satellite images, topographical maps, urban plans, statistical data, and studies on the subject in this context. These data have additionally been supported by field data.

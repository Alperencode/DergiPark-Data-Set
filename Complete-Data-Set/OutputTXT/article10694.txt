Makale Başlığı: Hyper-Fibonacci and Hyper-Lucas Hybrinomials
Özet: The hybrid numbers which are accepted as a generalization of complex, hyperbolic and dual numbers, have attracted the attention of many researchers recently. In this paper hyper-Fibonacci and hyper-Lucas  hybrinomials are defined. The recurrence relations, generation functions, as well as some algebraic and combinatoric properties are examined for newly defined hybrinomials.

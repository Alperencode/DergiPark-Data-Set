Makale Başlığı: CITY COMPARISONS IN TERMS OF PROPERTY PRICES AND HOUSING  AFFORDABILITY THROUGH MULTI-CRITERIA  DECISION-MAKING METHODS
Özet: Especially since the beginning of the pandemic period, millions of people with low and middle incomes are experiencing significant problems due to the rapid increase in real estate prices worldwide. Therefore, they have to allocate a significant portion of their income to rent or housing loans. The price of renting and purchasing a home is increasing faster than the average family income. Many of the 17 SDGs and 169 related objectives have a greater connection to housing than others. Governments should provide an environment where all individuals have access to adequate and affordable housing in socially, economically and ecologically sustainable communities, and where everyone can reach their full potential, through policies that support the Sustainable Development Goals. This study proposes a new and original integrated approach consisting of cluster analysis and multi-criteria decision-making methods to systematically analyse indicators and compare the performance of housing affordability and property prices in cities. After determining the indicator weights objectively with the Critic method, 60 cities from 25 countries are compared with TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE I-II, ARAS, COPRAS, ELECTRE, SAW and MAUT methods. Also, a general common ranking was obtained with the Borda Count Method. In addition, evaluations and comparisons are made in terms of countries and cities.

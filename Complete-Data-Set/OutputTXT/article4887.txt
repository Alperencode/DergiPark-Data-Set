Makale Başlığı: Life Expectancy at Birth and Environmental Degradation Link in Countries with High Air Pollution
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of PM2.5 air pollution, public health expenditures, fertility and mortality rates on life expectancy at birth between 2000-2019 in a total of 32 countries, which are in the categories of countries with hazardous, very unhealthy and unhealthy air pollution in the World Air Quality Report (2021), using a panel quantile regression model. Correlation analysis, multicollinearity, normality tests and Hausman test methodologies are followed in line with the aim. Panel quantile regression analysis is performed for the consecutive 10th-90th quantile range, and the findings are interpreted by estimating with robust standard errors for the case where the heterogeneity assumption is confirmed. In the estimation results with robust standard errors, it is reached that all variables in the model are statistically significant at 1% significance level. According to the results, a 5% increase in PM2.5 air pollution, fertility and mortality rates decreases life expectancy at birth by ~0.02%, ~0.17% and ~0.09%, respectively, while a 1% increase in health expenditures increases life expectancy at birth by ~0.04%. In this context, it is seen that the variable that affects life expectancy at birth the most is the fertility rate, and the variable that affects the least is PM2.5 air pollution.

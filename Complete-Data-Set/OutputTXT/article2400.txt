Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the change in the scientific attitudes of the students participating in the science festival
Özet: Science festivals are organizations that aim to raise public awareness on various scientific issues and popularize science.  Science Festivals' effects on participants have vital importance.  Accordingly, the impact of a science festival supported by the TÜBİTAK 4007 Science Festivals Support program on students' scientific attitudes is discussed.  The working group consists of middle and high school students participating in four activities.  The data collection tool was the scientific attitude scale.  Total attitude scores were compared according to total scientific attitude scores, gender, class level, and whether the participants followed popular science publications and participated in a science camp or scientific research project competition.  Results showed a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores except for the grade level.  Besides, students who did not read popular science books, watched experimental videos, or participated in scientific activities such as a science camp/research project competition experienced a more significant change in their attitude scores.  The effects of the activities in the science festivals be organized after that can be determined with mixed-method research.  Also, addressing the changes in the curiosity levels of the participants, and examining the long-term effects of the festivals can be effective in increasing these organizations' quality.

Makale Başlığı: Examining the Learning Outcomes of the Teaching Principles and Methods Course in the Context of Student-Centered Learning
Özet: The aim of this research is to examine how student-centered learning is reflected in the learning outcomes of the Teaching Principles and Methods courses in the primary education mathematics curriculum. The research was designed in the context of document scanning model. The web pages of 88 elementary mathematics teaching programs information package created in the context of the Bologna process were scanned. Frequency were used in the analysis of the data. Accordingly, there are no learning outcomes of the Teaching Principles and Methods course in approximately one quarter of the programs. The absence of learning outcomes in accredited programs is very rare compared to non-accredited programs. In the cognitive domain, the outcomes are at the level of knowledge and comprehension. In the affective domain, the outcomes are at the level of receiving and reacting. Accordingly, more attention can be given to learning outcomes at the levels of application and above for the course. Learning outcomes are not the only indicator of student-centered learning, but all elements of the course information package can be addressed with a more holistic perspective.

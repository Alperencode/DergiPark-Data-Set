Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Instructor's Guidebook for Village Primary Schools with a Three-Year Instructor in terms of Constructivist Approach
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to evaluate an instructor's guide book prepared for the second year of three year village primary schools with trainers in the Turkish education history within the framework of the constructivist approach. The practice of teaching in Turkey started with trials in 1936, became official in 1937 and continued until 1948. Within the scope of this practice, three year village primary schools with trainers were opened in some villages that had no school in those years, and trainers with temporary status were appointed to these schools. “Three year trainer's guidebooks” were prepared for these trainers in the years when the implementation started. One of these books, "Second Year Teaching Guide for Village Educators" was described by subjecting content analysis within the scope of document review according to the constructivist approach. As a result of the analysis, examination and evaluation, it was concluded that most of the instructions and activities in the guide book were in accordance with the constructivist approach, considering the conditions of the period. The examples in the book support this result. From this, the following suggestion can be made for educational researchers and teachers: Some approaches and practices that have been proposed as new may have historical roots. It is inevitable to benefit from this historical accumulation in order to create more effective learning processes.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Some Quality Properties for Honeydew Honeys of Ida Mountains
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine some quality properties of the honeydew honey of the Ida Mountains region within the borders of Çanakkale province. For this purpose, honeydew honey samples were obtained from Ayvacık, Bayramiç, Çan and Yenice those are the towns of Çanakkale being neighbors to Ida Mountains. Electrical conductivity, viscosity, moisture and brix, color, ash, acidity and pH value, sugar profile, mineral profile, proline and diastase number analyzes were performed for the honey samples and the results of these analyzes were analyzed statistically. In this study, electrical conductivity values, which are the main quality parameters of honeydew honey samples, are in the range of 0,86- 1,89 mS/cm, moisture content is between 15,10%-18,25%, and proline content is 614,36- 1040,20 mg/kg. It was also determined that the diastase numbers were higher than 8 and the free acidity values were lower than 50 meq/kg.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND MOBBING LIVING LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ON EMPLOYEE SILENCE
Özet: This study aims to reveal the relationship and effect of "communication skills" and "mobbing" level of the personnel working in Ankara Dr. Sami Ulus Obstetrics and Gynecology, Children's Health and Disease Training and Research Hospital with "Employee Silence". The research was carried out with the quantitative research method and the relational survey model was used as the research model. The sample of the study consists of 213 (168 female, 45 male) healthcare personnel determined by purposive sampling, which is one of the non-random sampling methods. Socio-Demographic Information Form, Communication Skills Assessment Scale, Mobbing Scale, Employee Silence Scale were applied to the participants in the study. For the purposes of the research, independent groups t-test and Pearson Correlation Analysis were used in the analysis of the data. Regression analysis was performed for the subscales of employee silence and modeled by examining their relations with other variables. As a result of this study, the rate of being exposed to mobbing in healthcare workers was not found to be high. In general, as the exposure to mobbing increases, it is observed that the employees become quieter, while communication skills do not have a significant effect on employee silence. Our results suggest that awareness-raising studies should be carried out to ensure and maintain a transparent and equitable communication environment among healthcare professionals, administrators and administrators, and to reduce the level of mobbing experience of healthcare professionals.

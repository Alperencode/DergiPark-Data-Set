Makale Başlığı: Oğuz Atay’s Dangerous Games novel in the light of Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of carnival: The Last Supper
Özet: Tehlikeli Oyunlar (literally The Dangerous Games) is Oğuz Atay’s second novel in which he successfully applied postmodern techniques after the Tutunamayanlar (The Unsettled). The novel’s subject consists of the journey the figure Hikmet takes on to his inner world and the accounting he lives with himself and society. In this article, The Last Supper, which constitutes the 16th part of the novel, has been evaluated around the carnival tradition with consideration of the work as a whole. It aims to present a different perspective in terms of understanding/interpreting the novel. Carnival theory forms the central axis of the work of the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. As a social event, carnival is one of the most important festivals of the people, especially in the Middle Ages. As a matter of fact, Bakhtin’s starting point is the relationship between the language of these festivities and the language and fiction of the literary work. In order to draw a theoretical framework before examining the novel, the carnival theory, which Bakhtin shows as examples, primarily through Rabelais and Dostoyevsky was emphasized. After briefly mentioning the carnival-themed works and studied in Turkish literature, The Dangerous Games, as a work that reflects the carnival atmosphere as an event and in which the carnival dominates the language and fiction of the literary work, is emphasized. In this way, it is aimed to show that the novel can be read with a different approach.

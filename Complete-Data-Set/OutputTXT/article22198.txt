Makale Başlığı: EXAMINING THE RELIGIOUS AND ETHNO-CULTURAL PRACTICES OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF SOLIDARITY NETWORKS:
Özet: This study aims to explain the specific immigration experience of immigrants within the framework of social networks. This study determines how the Senegalese immigrants living in Istanbul make sense of the institutionalization and solidarity networks they have developed within the Mouride tariqa and how these solidarity networks are reflected in their perception of identity and their relations with the country of origin. For this purpose, in-depth interviews were conducted with thirty-seven Senegalese immigrants, twenty-eight men and nine women in Istanbul. The field study was realized in August-October 2021; besides the in-depth interviews, the daily lives of the Senegalese immigrants and the Mouride meetings were examined with the participant observation technique. The research results were systematized and interpreted with the concepts of religious practices, solidarity, identity, and adaptation. After data examination, the theory of social and religious networks regarding immigrants and Senegalese Mourides provides a theoretical basis for the research.

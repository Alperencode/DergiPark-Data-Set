Makale Başlığı: New contributions to physico-chemical parameters in Ordu's Streams: Curi River (Ünye-Ordu)
Özet: The seasonal water samples were taken from six different stations in Curi River between January and December 2018. The dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, pH, salinity, resistance, TDS, nitrate, sulfate, nitrite and phosphate values were measured. The parameters measured at each station were interpreted according to seasonality. By determining the existing physicochemical parameters of the most important aquatic ecosystem of the region, the measures that can be taken against the negativities that may occur with the anthropogenic and ecological parameters that change from day to day have been evaluated.

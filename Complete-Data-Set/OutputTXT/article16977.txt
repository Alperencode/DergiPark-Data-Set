Makale Başlığı: The Comparision Of Self-Leadership Levels Of Sports Sciences Academics With Their Political Skills
Özet: The aim of this study is to compare the level of self-leadership of sports sciences academics with their level of political skills. The research sample included academics working in Sports Sciences in public and private universities in Turkey. This study consists of 251 academic participants. Regarding the research topic, Tabak, Sr and Türköz (2013) have used the self-leadership scale as a data collection tool to measure the validity and reliability tests of Tabak, Sr and Türköz (2013) that have been adapted to Turkish. To determine the political skills of academics in sports sciences, Ferris et al. (2005) developed a scale to assess them, and Özdemir and Gören (2015) used the Political Skills Inventory, which was adapted to Turkish. Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine self-leadership and political skill scales. The Scale of Self-Leadership is divided into 8 sub-dimensions and the Political Skill Scale into 4 sub-dimensions. In the correlation analysis, when there were no parametric cases, a non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used. The results of the study concluded that there was a moderate relationship between political skills and self-leadership scales of 43%. This research was presented at the 18th International Sports Sciences Congress as a paper.

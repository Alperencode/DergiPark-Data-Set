Makale Başlığı: Mother Friendly Hospital Model and Birth Satisfaction of Mothers
Özet: Introduction: Birth satisfaction of mothers is important for maternal and newborn health. Objective: In this study, it was aimed to determine the practices related to childbirth in mother-friendly and non-mother-friendly hospitals and the birth satisfaction of mothers. Method: The study was conducted between April 2019 and December 2019 in the postpartum clinics of two hospitals in Istanbul. The sample of the study consisted of 265 mothers. The data of the study were collected using the "Introductory Information Form" and the "Birth Satisfaction Scale". Statistical significance level was taken as p < .05. Results: It was determined that 58.5% of the mothers who participated in the study were between the ages of 25-34, 36.5% were high school graduates, and 82.3% were not working. The first pregnancy of 21.5% of the mothers was the first birth of 32.1%. In the study, the rates of movement restriction and food intake restriction at birth were lower in those who gave birth in a mother-friendly hospital compared to those who gave birth in a non-mother-friendly hospital; the rates of induction, amniotomy fundus compression, episiotomy and meeting physical needs were higher and there was a significant difference between the groups (p < .05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of birth satisfaction scale mean scores (p > .05). Conclusion: It was determined that whether the hospital was mother-friendly or not did not affect birth satisfaction. It is recommended that the study be conducted in state hospitals and with a large sample.

Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Analysis of Methyl Alcohol Poisonings Admitted to the Emergency Department
Özet: Objective: Methyl alcohol poisoning remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. This poisoning is still one of the important reasons for admission to emergency services. We aimed to examine the admission complaints, laboratory findings, treatment methods, clinical outcomes and examine the factors affecting the mortality of patients diagnosed with methyl alcohol poisoning in the emergency department.Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, we analysed the patients who were considered to be diagnosed with methyl alcohol intoxication among those who came to our emergency department due to alcohol intoxication from June 1, 2018 to June 1, 2020.Results: The study included 20 (4.86%) individuals with methyl alcohol poisoning among 411 people who presented to the emergency department due to ethyl and methyl alcohol intake and resulting effects.The mean age of the patients was 47.35±14.2 years  and 85% (n=17/20) were male. Upon reviewing the patients' admission symptoms, 70% were observed to have visual problems, 60% complaints of vomiting, 45% shortness of breath, and 40% changes in consciousness. In the study, it was revealed that 18.2%(n=2/11) females and 81.8%(n=9/11) males died, and the mortality rate was calculated as 55%(n=11/20).Conclusions: The presence of visual problems, hypotension, and coma in clinical findings, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, marked osmolar gap, an increase in lactate level, and hyperglycemia in laboratory findings may be the early signs of mortality in patients with methyl alcohol poisoning. Therefore, patients with these signs should be followed up more closely and treated.

Makale Başlığı: Development Investments Support Program: Rural Economic Infrastructure Projects The Example Of Bolu In 2021
Özet: The concept of rural development has become an essential element in the agricultural policies of countries day by day. The activities carried out in the context of rural development are associated with agricultural policies and directly affect the incentives of the states and various grant packages for individuals in rural areas. Rural development supports implemented in different countries of the world also find a place in Turkey with the Rural Development Investments Support Program (KKYDP) and IPARD projects. KKYDP, which has been implemented since 2006, consists of economic investments and rural economic infrastructure investments and is implemented in stages every year. While economic investments cover larger-scale agricultural projects, rural economic infrastructure projects generally include projects with low budgets for agricultural mechanization. In the province of Bolu, which is the subject of the research, 30 investors benefited from the 14th Stage rural economic infrastructure projects of KKYDP in 2021. According to the survey conducted with 30 investors in the study, it was determined that 67% of the investors applied to the program to meet their business needs and 50% to reduce their product costs. According to the research findings, 70% of the investors learned about the program through the media, 60% found the program successful and 80% demanded the reduction of bureaucracy in the program. In the study, it was aimed to develop the program by presenting suggestions about the Rural Development Investments Support Program (KKYDP).

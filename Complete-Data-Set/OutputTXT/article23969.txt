Makale Başlığı: PĪR OF THE WRESTLERS MAHMŪD-I PĪRYĀR-I VALĪ, HIS LIFE, LEGENDS AND WORKS
Özet: Evliya Çelebi, in the description of wrestlers in his famous Seyahatname, mentions that their master is “Hazrat-e Mahmud-e Piryar-e Vali”, although he fails to provide further details, mentioning only that he is “Hazrat-e Hamza’s kamar-basteh.” There is a lack of significant information about this character in Turkish modern studies, however, there is much written about him both in historical and hagiographic sources and in studies conducted outside of Türkiye. In the present article, the life, legendary sagas and works of Pahlavan Mahmud-e Piryar-e/Purya-ye Vali, who lived in the 13-14th centuries and is still known as the master of traditional wrestling athletes, will be addressed and the current discussion on these issues will be evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: Leaf Defoliation and Leaf Water Potential Effects on Cluster Properties and Yield in cv. Merlot
Özet: This research was carried out in order to determine the effects of leaf water potential and defoliation applications on the cluster characteristics by using Merlot/41B grafting combination in Chateau Kalpak vineyards in Sarkoy district of Tekirdag province. The trial was carried out in a vineyard for two years in the vegetation period of 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. In the experiment, there were leaf water potential [S0 (Control=no irrigation), S1 (-0.3/-0.5 MPa), S2 (-0.5/-0.7 MPa) and S3(<-0.7) MPa)] and defoliation methods; Control, Full Window, Right Window and Left Window were done respectively. As a result if vigneron’s want; low cluster width, low cluster length, low cluster weight and low number of berry per cluster in Merlot cv. in Sarköy district of Tekirdağ was concluded that Left Window application can be selected. And also S3 application can be preferred when low cluster weight, low cluster volume and low cluster compactness are desired.

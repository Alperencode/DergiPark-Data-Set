Makale Başlığı: Comparative evaluation of canal transportation and centering ability of various Ni-Ti rotary systems in retreatment of curved root canals
Özet: Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the canal transportation and centering ability of ProTaper, HeroShaper and two Ni-Ti rotary systems developed for retreatment (ProTaperRetreatment and R-Endo).Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty mesial canals of mandibular molars with curvatures between 30-40 degrees and radii of curvatures between 4-9 mm were embedded in a modified muffle system. The teeth were randomly divided into 8 groups (n=15). The roots were sectioned horizontally at 3, 6 and 9 mm from the working length. Cross-sections were digitally photographed under standardized conditions. Half of the root canals were prepared with ProTaper and the rest with HeroShaper. Postoperative photographs were obtained. Root canals were obturated with the respective gutta-percha cones of the systems and AHPlus sealer. Following retreatment with four systems, photographs were assessed for the canal transportation in 8 directions, and centering ratio. Results: Initial shaping with ProTaper resulted in more significant transportation than HeroShaper (p<0.05). After retreatment, R-Endo yielded negative transportation values in the apical and mid-sections. In canals prepared with ProTaper, in the apical and coronal root sections ProTaperRetreatment, and in the mid-sections ProTaper revealed more acceptable re-shaping results. In the canals prepared with HeroShaper, after retreatment, transportation and centering ability were relatively efficient with HeroShaper in the apical and mid-sections; and with ProTaper in the coronal sections.Conclusion: All systems caused a certain amount of transportation and eccentricity. Protaper, ProtaperRetreatment and HeroShaper showed similar re-shaping performance with regard to the initial shaping procedure. However, R-Endo yielded insufficient root canal cleaning in the apical and mid-sections.

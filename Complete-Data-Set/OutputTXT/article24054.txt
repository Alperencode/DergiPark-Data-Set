Makale Başlığı: Important Viruses of Honey Bees
Özet: In order for viruses to continue their generation, they must necessarily replicate in cells carrying their receptors. Changes occur in these unique cells, which are the target of viruses, as a result of result of reproduction. These changes are the death of the cell as a result of the disintegration of the cell that encounters the virus, the survival of the cell, but the constant scattering of the virus, the change in the genetic structure of the cell, the continuous reproduction of the cell, and the hiding of the virus in the cell. When the deformed wing virus replicates in the wing formation cells during the bee development period, it causes deformation of the wings in the adult bee due to its effects on these cells. Because bees with deformed wings cannot fly, they cannot feed and die. The aim of this review is to emphasize the viruses specific to bees, their transmission routes to bees and their effects on honey bee colonies.

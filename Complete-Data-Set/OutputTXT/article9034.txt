Makale Başlığı: Primary Immunodeficiency and Malignant Diseases: Two Case Report
Özet: Primary immunodeficiencies are diseases that predispose to malignancies other than recurrent infections. Genomic instability due to some unknown mechanisms and defective DNA repair processes in patients with primary immunodeficiency causes an increase in cancer risk, and it is thought that the risk of developing cancer in these patients varies between 4.7-5.7%. After infections, the most common cause of death in patients with primary immunodeficiency is malignancies. In this article, our first case is the patient who applied to the hospital with the complaint of cough and was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma in the follow-up, and at this stage, low immunoglobulins were detected in the tests and the diagnosis of lymphoma was simultaneously diagnosed as common variable immunodeficiency. Our second case is our patient who developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia while being followed up due to primary immunodeficiency. Here, we aimed to draw attention to the fact that the unusual first presentation of patients with primary immunodeficiency may be associated with malignancy and to increase the awareness of clinicians following patients with primary immunodeficiency about the development of malignancy.

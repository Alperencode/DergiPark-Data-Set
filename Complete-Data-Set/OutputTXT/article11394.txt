Özet: Aim: There is a complex relationship between asthma and psychiatric problems; therefore, it is important to investigate this relationship for optimal treatment. In this cross-sectional and comparative study, it was aimed to examine the dependent personality trait, depression, anxiety and stress levels of asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals.Material and Method: 382 individuals with (n=172) and without (n=210) asthma were included in our study. The study data were collected with Identifying Information Form, Personality Belief Questionnaire, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) 21-Short Form. Comparisons between groups were made using the Chi-square test, Mann Whitney-U test, and Pearson correlation test.Results: The mean age of the participants was 40.80±12.06, 45% of them were asthmatic, and the disease year was 7.92±8.49. It was observed that asthmatic individuals had high dependent personality trait and anxiety levels (p<0.050). It was found that there was a weak positive correlation between dependent personality trait and depression, anxiety and stress, and the correlation between dependent personality trait and anxiety and depression was higher in asthmatic individuals.Conclusion: The incidence of dependent personality trait and anxiety was higher in asthma patients. In asthma management, it is recommended that personality traits and psychiatric symptoms should be handled with care along with pharmacological treatments.

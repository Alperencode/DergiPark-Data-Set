Makale Başlığı: Changing Roles of Executive Nurses
Özet: Health institutions are at the forefront of providing effective and efficient health care services in order to gain superiority in an increasingly competitive environment. In this context, managerial roles have become increasingly important today. As a result of the change in health policies and health financing methods, nursing service managers in hospitals have made it necessary to reorganize their roles and responsibilities regarding changing care delivery models and emerging models. Roles are determined according to the jobs and functions in the classification of nursing activities. Nurses, who are responsible for the quality of nursing services, need to keep up with the changes in order to fulfill the roles expected from them. As a result of the literature research, it was determined that there were 13 nursing roles according to the jobs and functions, and the independent status of the nurse in each of these roles was examined. Thus, it is aimed to examine to what extent the changes between the traditional roles of managers and their changing roles in the 21st century have taken place in which role.

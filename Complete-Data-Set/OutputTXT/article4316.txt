Makale Başlığı: ACADEMIC DISCOURSE AND EXEMPLIFICATION: EXEMPLIFICATORY MARKERS IND HARD AND SOFT SCIENCE ARTICLES
Özet: One of the strategies used in order to make the information understandable and acceptable to the readers in the texts organized within the framework of the expectations of the discourse community is exemplification. In the context of scientific texts, this expectation of the discourse community is that the text is denotative and monosemic. The authors use exemplification in which one discourse unit concretizes or supports another discourse unit to clarify the meaning. The aim of this study is to determine the exemplifications used in the articles in the field of hard and soft sciences, and in which part of the text and with which markers these exemplifications were given. For this purpose, a database consisting of 1,068,028 words from articles in the fields of physics, chemistry, linguistics, and psychology was created and this database was analyzed with the AntConc program. The results of the study are that soft sciences tend to have more exemplifications than hard sciences, exemplification in all fields is more frequent in the introduction part of the articles, the use of some exemplificatory markers is preferred, there are similarities in the use of markers in hard and soft sciences articles, except for the frequency of use.

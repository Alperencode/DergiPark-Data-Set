Makale Başlığı: The Varieties Of Human Being As Praised (Helpful) And Criticized (Destructive) In The Context Of 204-207th Verses Of The Chapter Of The Cow / Surah Al-Baqarah
Özet: Various human types or characteristics are mentioned in the Qur’an. These various human types or characteristics which are mentioned are criticized or praised by the Qur’an according to their behaviours. Someone who is criticized in the Qur’an is mischief, cruel, destroyer of generation and products on the earth. Inner world and external world of this character or type are not the same. Although he/she introduces himself/herself as kind person, the inner world of this person wants other people’ evil and damage. The praised character makes an effort with a good and honest way in all kinds of behaviours and movements. The main goal of this type is safety and well-being of individual, society and humankind. He/she is not the person who acts for flaunting in all movements. The main purpose of this type is to gain the will of God or acts for Mercy’s Sake. This person elaborates his/her all kinds of actions in certain measurement and character while considering his/her life of hereafter. These two kinds of characters had existed in all communities throughout history and after this period they will continue to be existed in the future too. The Qur’an has wanted all individuals to take positive and good characters as a model and to avoid negative and bad characters while exhibiting real situations of these people. This emphasis had spreaded all over the Qur’an. The struggle between good characters and bad characters have permanently depicted in the Qur’an. The peace and happiness of good people and the frustration of bad people in the world and hereafter have been emphasized all the time.

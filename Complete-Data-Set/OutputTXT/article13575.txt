Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Immunonutrients in The Covid-19 Pandemic: Arginine, Glutamine and Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Özet: The coronavirus epidemic, which was first seen in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and reported as a pandemic by WHO in March 2020, has affected the whole world since then. Coronavirus disease is a disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, called the new type of coronavirus, with symptoms such as cold symptoms, pneumonia, multi-organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and can be fatal. Currently, antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial agents are used in the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In addition, DNA-RNA-based, viral vector-based, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines such as inactivated virus have been developed and continue to be developed. On the other hand, some immunonutrients, which are extremely effective in strengthening immunity, come to the fore in improving the course of Covid-19 infection and alleviating its symptoms. In this review article, studies examining the effectiveness of arginine, glutamine and omega-3 fatty acids in Covid-19 infection and national/international guidelines are discussed.

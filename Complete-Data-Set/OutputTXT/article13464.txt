Makale Başlığı: AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH EXPENDITURES IN TURKEY
Özet: Due to air pollution, approximately 45 thousand preventable premature deaths occur in Turkey every year. Disturbances, and deaths due to air pollution have an impact on both the economy, and health expenditures. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to examine the costs of health expenditures due to the discomforts caused by air pollution. The study data consists of the changes in the factors affecting air pollution between the years 2009-2019, provided by OECD Statistics, and the health expenditure costs caused by HEAL 2021 air pollution. In the research, the data are interpreted by turning them into graphs, and tables. As a result of the examinations, it has been seen that a minimum of 25,845 million TL, and a maximum of 52,492 million TL of health costs have arisen as a result of air pollution in Turkey. Air pollution affects people, animals, plants and even objects. Air pollution arising in one country can be carried in the atmosphere and affect air pollution in another place. Air pollution affects not only one area but the whole world. Therefore, it is necessary to realize the pollutant factor limits with strict measures with global cooperation. Establishing incentive policies for the use of renewable and clean energy resources with global cooperation will ensure a healthier society and a strong economy.

Makale Başlığı: ALEXANDRU AVRAM (1956-2021)
Özet: Another great scholar left us too early, as the capricious Tyche stopped his life in full floruit. Aged 64, Alexandru Avram was waiting his retirement from the teaching activities ‒ always fulfilled with seriousness and goodwill ‒ with the great hope to consecrate exclusively to the publications in progress or planned, and thus meant to crown a life dedicated to the study of Antiquity. His work was already both large and important: the exemplary edition of the Callatian corpus (ISM III: Inscriptions grecques et latines de Scythie Mineure,  III.  Callatis et son territoire, Bucharest-Paris 1999) and the recent supplement of Tomitan inscriptions  (ISM  VI.2: Inscriptions  grecques  et  latines  de  Scythie  Mineure,  vol.  VI.  Suppléments, fasc. 2: Tomis et son territoire, Bucharest-Paris 2018, with M. Bărbulescu and L. Buzoianu); the treaty between Rome and Callatis (Der Vertrag zwischen Rom und Kallatis. Ein Beitrag zum römischen Völkerrecht, Amsterdam 1999 [Schwarzmeer-Studien7]); the Thasian amphora stamps found at Istros (Histria  VIII.  Les timbres amphoriques.

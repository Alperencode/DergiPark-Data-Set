Makale Başlığı: Effects of Salinity Levels of Nutrient Solution in Different Growing Periods on Yield and Some Quality Parameters of Garden Cress (Lepidium sativum L.) Cultivation by Floating Systems
Özet: In this research, it was aimed to determine the effects of different salinity levels on yield and some quality parameters of garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) growing in floating system during two consecutive growing seasons between November (Growing period 1: YD1) and February (Growing period 2: YD2) in unheated greenhouse conditions. In the study, standard Hoagland solution was filled in pools with a dimension of 2.40x1.40x0.30 m and receiving 400 liters of solution, and the control treatment [Electrical conductivity (EC): 1.8 mS cm-1] and three salinity levels (EC: 2.8, 3.8 and 4.8 mS cm-1) were compared. Desired salinity levels were achieved by adding sodium chloride (NaCl) to the solution. In the study, total yield, vitamin C, nitrate and potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) contents of cress plants were investigated. According to the results of the study, the total yield varied between 730.48-1563.84 g m-2 in the first growing period and between 386.93-936.24 g m-2 in the second growing period. While the highest total yield was obtained in the control treatment (1.8 mS cm-1), the yield values decreased by increasing nutrient salinity levels. Vitamin C content of cress leaves varied between 3.80-5.51 mg g-1, and nitrate content was between 67.79-238.15 mg kg-1. In the study, K content varied between 0.304-0.472%, Na content 0.033-0.044%, Ca content 0.977-2.490%, and Mg content between 0.168-0.176%, and these values were found to be consistent with reference values. When the overall results were evaluated, it was concluded that the total yield values decreased with the increase in the salinity level in the nutrient solution, but the yield value at the higher salt level (3.8 mS cm-1) in the winter months (YD2) was high, and the studies should be continued considering by the light and temperature differences.

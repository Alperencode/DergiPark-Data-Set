Makale Başlığı: Today’s Sustainable Energy, Municipal Solid Wastes, and Turkey Potential
Özet: Organic solid wastes are biodegradable then they form a gas mixture consisting of 45-60% methane and 40-60% carbon dioxide, which is also defined as landfill gas. As long as humans, the main cause of waste, exist in nature, municipal solid wastes also carry the quality of high potential sustainable energy and are the subject of this study. In the study, the bio-degradation processes, and the parameters that affect these processes of municipal solid wastes are examined, and the current solid waste potential of Turkey which has 7 different regions and 81 cities, is determined using 2020 data. Turkey, with a population of 78.2 million, has 1.13 kg per person per day average waste and is collected 32.3 million tons of annually municipal solid waste by the Municipalities. Also, the regional distributions are examined. It has been determined that the solid waste amount of the Marmara Region, which has the highest population density, is the highest among other regions and the average solid waste consumption rate per capita is above the average of Turkey. In Istanbul, which is the largest city and constitutes 19.7% of Turkey's population, the average daily waste amount per person is above the country average. Bringing landfill gas containing 45-60% methane gas to the economy in countries like Turkey whose energy is dependent on foreign sources is important in terms of both energy gain and preventing the release of landfill gases to nature.

Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF IRANIAN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WITH SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE IN HOT AND DRY AREAS
Özet: The culture and knowledge of the residents and users of the building is one of the most important and influential factors in the formation of the form and space of architecture and its interior design. Since the degree of attachment of users and residents to the space and environment in residential buildings is much more than other uses, and also because the sense of ownership and freedom of action of residential building users is higher than other buildings and spaces, so the importance and role of culture in design and the development of residential spaces will be doubled. The aim of this study is to analyze and explain the aspects of culture and its influence on the interior design of traditional Iranian dwellings in hot and dry climates. The research method of this article is analytical-descriptive.

Makale Başlığı: The Period of Development of Khorezm Minstrel Traditions
Özet: This article discusses the latest developments in the art of minstrel. It is also known that the parishioners in Khorezm were a form of shamanism and shamanism was one of the earliest stages in the formation of the art of bakhshi. In particular, the article emphasizes that in the researches of A. N. Samoilovich the Khorezm bakhshis sang book epics, played the dutar, bulamon. The deification of the bakhshi people is due to their high memory and the fact that they have a word. It is believed that the recitation of epics by drummers dates back to the 10th and 11th centuries. This phenomenon may be more ancient. The first person in Khorezm to be considered a bakhshi and a pir of bakhshis (1115-1191) was Oshiq Aydin (Oshugiddin Umar Sukhravardi), who is still the patron saint of bakhshis. His personality is also deified. According to historical sources, Oshik Aydin was a master of words and phrases and at the same time a statesman. He also wrote a pamphlet on music. Considering that he lived during the reign of the Khorezm kings, it is possible to understand that the art of bakhshi was developed at that time. After the Aydin Pir, the person who became famous in the Turkic world as o’zon, shaman and bakhshi is Korkut Ata. It is said that the 19th and early 20th centuries were the heyday of Khorezm bakhshi art.

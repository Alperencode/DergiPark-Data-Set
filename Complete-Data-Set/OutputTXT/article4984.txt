Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF LINKEDIN PROFILE FEATURES WITH A MULTI-CRITERIA APPROACH AND A RECRUITMENT PROCESS CASE STUDY
Özet: Gathering job seekers or employers on a single social media platform, LinkedIn allows users to directly reach decision makers through an online profile they create. The increasing competitive environment in today's job market and the difficulty for job seekers to differentiate themselves from their competitors increase the importance of LinkedIn profiles and profile features. The presence of ambiguous, contradictory and subjective information in complex decision-making problems can cause uncertainty. In order to effectively model such decision problems and define uncertainties, fuzzy logic and heuristic fuzzy sets and interval-valued heuristic fuzzy (ADSB) sets, which are high-level extensions of fuzzy logic, are used. In the current study, an integrated approach is proposed in which ADSB clusters and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method are used together. In practice, four recruitment professionals who are experts in their fields determined the importance levels of the features on their LinkedIn profiles, and three job seekers were evaluated according to their profiles. The results show that LinkedIn profile attributes are ranked in order of importance as work experience (0,155), summary (0,153), title (0,144), reference (0,136), photo (0,128), share (0,121), follow (0,096), and link (0,065).

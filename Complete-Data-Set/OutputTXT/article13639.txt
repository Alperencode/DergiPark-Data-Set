Makale Başlığı: The Mental Image of The City in Turkish Painting of The Metamodernism Era
Özet: In our time, special requirements are put forward for the creation of urban space.These requirements reflect the transformation processes of the city, which isa complex socio-cultural object included in the system of global connections.The design of urban space emerges as the primary reflection of the city andembodies an understanding of the city’s structure, functional use and aestheticform. In H. Lefebvre terminology, space is created according to these concepts.The works of the artists, for whom the city has become an object of interest,take on a secondary reflection task. The reality of the modern city calls for theexpression of its definition to be sought. This quest is clearly reflected in theworks of Turkish artist Nuri Kuzucan. Nuri Kuzucan’s works from the two firstdecades of the 21st century, provide very clear data on how the ways of speakingabout the city have changed. The artist's work on form in many respects repeatsthe search for artists of the last century. Kuzucan's creativity has three periods.Each of them corresponds to a new concept of the city at the beginning of the21st century. In this article, it is aimed to examine the languages which areused to describe the urban culture in the beginning of the 20th century. Theaim of the study, in which an interdisciplinary approach is used, is to examinethe works of the contemporary Turkish artist, Nuri Kuzucan, which show thetransformation process of urban culture in the paradigm of metamodernism. Themethodological basis of the article is the semiotic analysis of the visual object.

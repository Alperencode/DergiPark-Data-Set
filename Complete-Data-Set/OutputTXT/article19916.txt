Makale Başlığı: New Generation Surfactants, Are They A Hope For Better Outcomes?
Özet: Animal derived natural surfactants have been used in the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome for nearly 25 years with great success, but new, better and cheap surfactants are still needed. THese new surfactants are mostly synthetic and some have been used clinically while some are still under review and have not been approved for use in infants. Recombinant SP-C, lucinactant, CHF5633, MİNİ-B and SP-C33 are some of the new generation synthetic surfactants which are disscussed in this review.

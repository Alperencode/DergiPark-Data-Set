Makale Başlığı: Determination of fungal and bacterial species and their densities in fruit and airborne microbiota in citrus packing houses located in Hatay province
Özet: Aims: This study aims to determine fungal and bacterial species and their densities in fruit and airborne microbiota in citrus packing houses located in Antakya, Dörtyol and Erzin districts of Hatay province.Methods and Results: Investigation were conducted in citrus fruit packing houses in Hatay province in 2020-2021. In order to determine the airborne microbiota, the nutrient media were placed in 3 different regions of the packing houses (product entrance, fruit processing and product dispatch). Fruit-borne fungal and bacterial isolates were obtained from the deliberately selected rotten fruits. Fungal and bacterial isolates were identified by morphological, biochemical and MALDI-TOF proteomic analysis. Penicillium italicum, Penicillium digitatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus oryzae, Mucor circinelloides, Xanthomonas hortorum, Pantoea eucrina, Leclercia adecarboxylata, Pseudescherichia vulneris, Bacelliotymegatibia vulnerica, Bacelliot, eucrina, Leclercia adecarboxylata and Pseudescherichia vulnerica were determined as airborne fungal and bacterial species. Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum, Fusarium solani, Geotrichum citri-auranti, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium herbarum, Phytophthora sp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Geotrichum candidum, Erwinia herbicola, Xanthomonas hortorum were isolated and identified as fruit borne fungal and bacterial species on infected fruits.Conclusions: It has been observed that the airborne microbiota density is quite higher in the fruit processing section of the packinghouses, while the microbiota density is low in the product acceptance (entry) and dispatch (exit) sections because of proper ventilation.Significance and Impact of the Study: Airborne fungal and bacterial microbiota in the packinghouses can be easily transported by air movements and remain suspended in the air for a certain period of time, causing symptoms such as deterioration and rot in fruits. Since some of identified airborne bacterial and fungal species are known as allergens or human pathogens, necessary advices were given about the sanitation measures which should be taken into consideration in commercial citrus packinghouses.

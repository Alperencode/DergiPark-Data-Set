Makale Başlığı: A RARE COMPLICATION IN A PATIENT WITH FACTOR VII DEFICIENCY UNDERWENT LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY: POSTOPERATIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM
Özet: Factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a congenital autosomal recessive coagulation disorder with a prevalence of 1:500,000. In this case report, we aimed to present the anesthesia management and intensive care process of a 41-year-old patient with abnormal uterine bleeding, factor VII deficiency and planned laparoscopic hysterectomy. An operation was planned for a 41-year-old (60 kg, 164 cm) patient with known Factor VII (FVII) deficiency with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding. Preoperative Laboratory values were as follows; PT: 70, INR: 6.9, aPTT: 29 Hb: 13.3, Plt: 274 and F VII: 1.1%. Following the induction of anesthesia, 1500 mcg rFVIIa (novoseven NOVO NORDİSK HEALTH PRODUCTS) was given intravenously over 3 minutes by slow infusion 10 minutes before starting the operation. Intraoperative first coagulation parameters were PT: 20.14, INR: 0.8, aPTT: 27.3. There was minimal bleeding during the surgery. At the end of the operation, 5 minutes after the patient was extubated, ST elevation, tachycardia (128/min), hypotension (60/30 mmHg) and a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation (SpO2) were observed in the electrocardiogram. In pulmonary CT angiography, there was an appearance consistent with hypodense thrombus material that allowed flow in placed plin the lower lobes of the right main pulmonary artery and in the lower lobe branches of the left main pulmonary artery. The patient, who was followed up in the intensive care unit for 3 days postoperatively, was taken to the ward. It should be kept in mind that thromboembolism complications may occur in patients with factor VII deficiency, even given doses recommended in hematology guidelines.

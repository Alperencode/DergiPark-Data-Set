Makale Başlığı: CO2 respiration rates of einkorn wheat at different temperature and moisture contents
Özet: Temperature and grain moisture content are the main factors affecting grain spoilage in storage. These factors have a significant impact on the maintenance of quality, insect, fungus, and pest development. The main objective of this study was to determine the CO2 concentration and respiration rate of hulled einkorn wheat in different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C) and grain moisture contents (9.1%, 11.5%, 13.8%, and 15.9%, wet basis) by means of CO2 sensors. Multiple polynomial regression equation was developed to predict respiration as affected by temperature and grain moisture content. The CO 2 concentrations and respiration rates of wheat increased with an increase in temperature and grain moisture content. The highest mean cumulative CO 2 concentrations of 5461.4 ppm and respiration rate of 12.38 mg CO2 kg(-1) h(-1) were found with temperature at 35 degrees C. Minimum respiration rates were determined at 5 and 10 degrees C in all moisture contents. Adjusted R-square value of the multiple polynomial prediction equation depending on storage temperature and grain moisture content was found to be 0.76. According to these results, ambient temperature and grain moisture content were found to be extremely effective on respiratory rate. This study showed that 9.1-13.8% moisture content and 10-20 degrees C are suitable conditions to store einkorn wheat without a decrease in nutritional properties for long-term periods.

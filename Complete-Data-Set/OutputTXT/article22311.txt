Makale Başlığı: Ideal Perception of Beauty and Beauty in Female Figures in Matthias Verginer's Sculptures
Özet: For centuries, the body has been an important factor in determining the social position and roles of women and men. However, it becomes possible to talk about a distinction between men and women in the sense dedicated to the body. The phenomenon of “beauty” takes its place at the beginning of the mentioned distinctions. “Beauty” has been one of the basic criteria preferred to define women in many cultures. However, the meaning of the phenomenon of beauty has changed depending on time and society. The perception of ideal beauty is a phenomenon that has undergone changes in the historical process. In addition, it differs from society to society, according to the development processes of societies and cultural structures. The perception of ideal beauty in humans has turned into a system of values that are largely addressed through women. For this reason, women were evaluated according to these "ideal beauty" criteria, and even those who did not comply with these criteria from time to time were excluded by being called ugly or other adjectives. Matthias Verginer, who puts overweight female figures in the center of his sculptures, ironically dealt with the perception of ideal beauty, and the female figures in his sculptures worked as overweight women. As a reaction to the objectification of the female body, the overweight female figures he made in his sculptures form the basis of this work.

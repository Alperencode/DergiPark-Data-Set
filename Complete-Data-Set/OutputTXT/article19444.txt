Makale Başlığı: The Methods Of Writing Grammar Books And Their Impact On Understanding Arabic Grammar
Özet: Grammar is one of the most important sciences of the Arabic language, on which ancient and modern scholars wrote many books. While presenting this science, the methods followed by the authors in their works differed. In the same way, various methods have been followed in classifying the syntax chapters. This research aims to identify the methods used by the authors of grammar books.  By examining the syntax sections of classical books such as (Kafiya Ibn al-Hajeb,Al-Mofassal by Al-Zamakhshari, Ham’a Al-Hawami’ by Al-Suyuti, and Ibn Aqil’s commentary on Alfiya Ibn Malik) and modern grammar books such as: (The comprehensive healing grammar by Mahmoud Hosni Maghalsa, The Collector of Arabic Lessons by Mustafa Al-Ghalayini and the Applied Grammar of Abd al-Rajhi), the technics and methods they followed will be tried to be determined. This research attempts to answer two questions that occupy researchers: Which styles are more suitable for a grammar lesson? Which one is more beneficial to the learner? The research concluded that the arrangement of the chapters according to the grammatical function or according to the theory of attribution are the best methods in arranging the grammatical chapters and so the meaning meant by the Arabic sentence can be more easily understood.

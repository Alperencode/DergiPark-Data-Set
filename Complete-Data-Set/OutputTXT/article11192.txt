Makale Başlığı: Investigation of groundwater zooplankton fauna from water wells in Yayladağ district of Hatay province in Turkey
Özet: Some water quality parameters (water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH) and zooplankton fauna were investigated in 10 water wells where the study was conducted. In this study, 14 species of Rotifera (46.67%), 10 species of Copepoda (33.33%), and 6 species of Cladocera (20%) were identified. It was found that the widely distributed species Rotaria neptunia (in 7 wells), Keratella quadrata (in 5 wells), Daphnia curvirostris (in 8 wells), Coronatella rectangula (in 6 wells), Chydorus sphaericus and Pleuroxus aduncus (in 5 wells each), Megacyclops viridis (in 8 wells) and Tropocyclops prasinus (in 6 wells). The most species (14 species) were found in well 8, followed by wells 3, 5, 7 and 9 with 11 species. In general, it was determined that there was a significant and positive relationship between zooplankton species diversity and abundance, and water quality parameters.

Makale Başlığı: Do Social Support for Women and Men Change in Reducing Job Stress? An Examination on Research Assistants
Özet: Job   stress   is   considered   as   a   significant   organizational   problem   that   reduces   employees’   productivity,   increases   risk   of   suffering   an   occupational  accident,  and  causes  low  performance  and  turnover.  This  study  determines  how  social  support  perceived  by  employees  from  nonwork  sources  affects  the  stress  experienced  in  the  workplace  and  how this effect differs for women and men. In the study, the relationships between three sources of social support, job stress, and gender were investigated. Data were collected through a questionnaire from 96 research assistants working at a state university in Turkey. Hypotheses were tested by partial  least  squares  structural  equation  modeling  using  SmartPLS  3.  The  study  findings  show  that  all  three  sources of social support reduce job stress. Besides, it has been determined that the reducing effect of family support on job stress is significant only for women, and the reducing effect of friend support on job stress is significant only for men. The effect of significant other support on job stress does not differ between women and men. The findings of the study might contribute to the current understanding of the relationship between social support and employee health. Additionally, the study findings will assist the university administration in developing effective measures to reduce job stress.

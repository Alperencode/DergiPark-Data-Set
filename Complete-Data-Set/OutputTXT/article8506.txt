Makale Başlığı: Investigation of antioxidant properties, essential oil, and fatty acid composition of Onobrychis armena Boiss. & Huet
Özet: Background and Aims: In this study, Onobrcyhis armena Boiss. & Huet was screened for its antioxidant potential, fatty acids and volatile compounds.Methods: Antioxidant activities of different extracts (ethyl acetate, methanol and water) were measured using the phospho- molybdenum assay, free radical scavenging assay, β-carotene/linoleic acid method, and ferric and cupric reducing power assay. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were also calculated spectrophotometrically.Results: GC analysis revealed that the oil was dominated by palmitic (22.67%) and linoleic (15.09%) acids. Unsaturated acids levels were higher than saturated fatty acids. The essential oil was analyzed by GC-MS system and twenty-two volatile com- pounds were identified. The identified major components were n–hexadecanoic acid, 9-12 octadecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid and hexahydro farnesyl acetone.Conclusion: The results of this study show that O. armena can be used as an easily accessible source of natural antioxidants and unsaturated fatty acids in food and pharmaceutical industries.

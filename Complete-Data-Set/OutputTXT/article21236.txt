Makale Başlığı: Determination of the Efficacy of Sulfur and Giant Knotweed (Reynoutria spp., Regalia) Plant Extract in Thyme Plant Against Powdery Mildew Disease (Golovinomyces biocellatus Ehrenb.V.P. Heluta)
Özet: Thyme which is in the group of medicinal and aromatic plants and the family of Lamiaceae, is used as a medicine in the treatment of some diseases. In our country, thyme has been widely grown in the Aegean Region, Denizli and Manisa provinces in recent years and it contributes greatly to the country's economy in exports. Golovinomyces biocellatus Ehrenb V.P.Heluta causes powdery mildew disease in thyme. The disease appears on the lower leaves of the plant and it is also seen on the stem. Infected leaves curl, turn brown and eventually dry out, causing yield and quality losses in the plant. In this study, the effectiveness of 80% sulfur and giant knotweed (Reynoutria spp., Regalia, Syngenta) plant extract against powdery mildew disease in thyme plant was investigated. For this purpose, the trials were established under field conditions as foliar spraying of plants In both trials, 80% sulfur was found to be more effective, although giant knotweed showed an efficacy of about 87% as a plant-based fungicide.

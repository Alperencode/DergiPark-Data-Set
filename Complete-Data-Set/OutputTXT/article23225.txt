Makale Başlığı: Optimization of Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) Process  Parameters Using Neuro-Regression Analysis for Fabrication of Precision  Electrodes with Complex Shapes
Özet: The wire electrical discharge process is extremely important in the fabrication of complex electrodes with delicate structures. Identifying optimal operating combinations is a challenge in industry due to the large number of process variables. To overcome this difficulty, neuro-regression analysis was used and optimization was performed.  Various regression models have been tested in the literature using 𝑅^2𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔, 𝑅^2𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑅^2𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜n. Multiple regression model types including linear, quadratic, trigonometric and rational forms were tested. Taguchi design and regression analysis were used to test the output-input models in the reference study. In this study, twelve regression models with six parameters were tested. These parameters are discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension and dielectric flow rate. The study shows that WEDM process parameters can be adjusted to achieve better surface finish and cutting width at the same time. The process is optimized by minimizing kerf and surface roughness. Optimization results are 0.17044 mm for kerf and 3.60393 µm for surface roughness. It is seen that the processing model is suitable and the optimization technique meets the practical requirements.

Makale Başlığı: Aydın Ayan's View of Art and Analysis of His Works in the Context of Art and Communication
Özet: It’s thought that the first communication of people with art was with cave paintings or small sculptures found in the periods before the in-vention of writing. Since the known history of humanity, there have been many transfers of knowledge, thought, belief, history and culture through art. Today, besides information and technology, art still continues to be an important tool in communication. With their works, artists contribute to communication in many subjects such as their perspectives on events in the society they live in, the transfer of their feelings and thoughts in their inner world, and culture. These transfers, in fact, turn a work of art into a communication tool. Today, many of our artists in contemporary Turkish painting successfully use this communication language in their works. Aydın Ayan is one of our valuable artists who is defined as critical realist within the social context with the communication he established with his works. In this study, the image, symbol, color and composition used by the artist in his works were tried to be examined in terms of their qualities, and the literature scanning and work analysis method within the qualitative research model was used. As a result of the study, it was found that the colors, symbols and images used in his works strengthen the critical realist themes of the artist.

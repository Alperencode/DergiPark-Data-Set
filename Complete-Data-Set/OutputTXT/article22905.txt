Makale Başlığı: Diagnosis Process of the Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Family According to Orem Self-Care Theory: A Case Report
Özet: Introduction: The child with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) and his family are faced with many negativeexperiences in the physical, psychological and social areas.Children with ASD, who have communication andinteraction problems, exhibit intense behavioral problems,making it difficult for the family to adapt to the disease. Therole of the nurse is very important in evaluating the childwith ASD after the diagnosis and supporting the family inthe treatment process accordingly. Nurses provide care totheir patients within the framework of standardized theoriesand models, increasing the quality of care andprofessionalism. In this process, nursing care created in linewith the Orem Self-Care Theory supports the practice toincrease the potential of getting positive results in childrenwith autism.Aim and Method: In this case report, the evaluation of thechild with ASD and his/her family within the scope of fullycorrective, partially corrective and supportive-educativenursing systems in line with Orem Self-Care Theory andthe process of going to the nursing diagnosis as a result ofthis evaluation are discussed on a case.Conclusion: It is possible to say that Orem's Self-CareTheory contributes to the evaluation of children with ASDand their families and to determine their needs in order tostrengthen their coping systems.

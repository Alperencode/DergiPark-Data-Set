Makale Başlığı: Use of fermented pseudo-cereals in gluten-free bread production: Effects on physical and textural properties
Özet: In this study, buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth were fermented by 2 different methods (spontaneous and using yeast) and used at different ratios (0, 15, 30 and 45%) in gluten-free bread formulation consisting of corn starch and rice flour combination. The effects of fermented pseudocereals on the physical and textural properties of gluten-free breads were evaluated. Crust and crumb brightness (L*) values of breads containing buckwheat fermented dough were lower than breads containing quinoa and amaranth. The increase in the pseudocereal fermented dough (PFH) ratio in the formulation caused a decrease in the crust brightness value and an increase in the redness (a*) value in breads. The highest volume value in breads was determined in the samples containing quinoa. Higher volume, specific volume and lower firmness values were obtained in breads containing pseudocereals fermented using yeast, compared to spontaneous fermentation. Hardness values at the 2nd, 24th, 48th and 72nd hours showed a significant increase with increasing PFH ratio (p<0.05). While buckwheat added breads gave the highest crumb hardness value at 72 hours, the lowest hardness value was determined in breads containing quinoa.

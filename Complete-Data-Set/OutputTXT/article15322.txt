Makale Başlığı: Extending Value-Belief and Norm Theory with Social Identity for Preventing Food Waste at Restaurants
Özet: The purpose of the study in interest is to investigate role of value, belief, norm and identity as preventive factors on being inclined to waste specifically in terms of plate leftovers at restaurant. To do so, Value-belief norm (VBN) theory was merged with social identity theory to serve the aim and structured hypothesis built around the premises of both theories was tested through receiving the perspectives of 374 restaurant costumers those benefited from any restaurant service within sixth month period. The study results have yielded that pro-environmental identity is the leading predictor behind attitude toward preventing food waste. Also, pro-environmental value was seen to enhance towards both attitude and intention towards preventing food waste through belief and norm oriented factors at a spectacular level. More specifically, sequential relation chain involving interrelation amongst constructs like pro-environmental value, belief and environmental norm was validated. In that, pro-environmental value seemed to enhance new environmental paradigm as the belief factor within the model which has in turn predicted the environmental norm significantly. Also, environmental norm seemed to predict both attitude and behavioral intention towards preventing food waste at restaurant context. Theoretical and practical implications were brought forward in a reasonable degree of interest in align with finding of the research.

Makale Başlığı: ALI FETHI EFENDI FROM RUSÇUK IN THE CLASSICAL AND MODERN INSTITUTIONS OF THE TANZİMAT PERIOD
Özet: The Tanzimat period of the Ottoman Empire is known as a period in which reforms were made in all social and political fields. With the entry of this period, namely the 19th century, it is often seen that modern institutions began to be established alongside the classical period institutions. In this study, we discussed the short life story of Ali Fethi Efendi from Ruscuk, who contributed to Istanbul and Istanbul madrasahs and thus to the scientific life by working as a muderris in Istanbul madrasahes during the reign of Sultan Abdulmecid and his rapid progress in the profession of mudarris, which started during the reign of Mahmud II and continued under the rule of Sultan Abdülmecid, and at the same time differed from many muderrises. In addition, we examined the duties and the position of Ali Fethi Efendi who also has books on different subjects in the school and councils. Thus, based on the example of Ali Fethi Efendi, we tried to show that, contrary to some general opinions, some of the central scholars of the period were not against or even outside the reforms and modernizing institutions, but were actively involved in the modern period institutions that were established and decided to be established as a result of the reforms and contributed to these institutions.

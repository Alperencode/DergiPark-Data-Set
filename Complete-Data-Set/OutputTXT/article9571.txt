Makale Başlığı: An Investigation in the Context of Employee Motivation About the Twitter Messages belonging to the Minister of Health of the Republic of Türkiye Regarding the Covid-19 Period : LDA-Based Topic Modelling Approach
Özet: The power of social media in communication has become more important with the new world brought about by Covid-19. The main purpose of this research is to examine the tweets shared by the Minister of Health of the Republic of Türkiye during the pandemic period in the context of employee motivation. For this, creating a probabilistic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using Python libraries has been determined as a sub-goal. The analyzes started with 3371 tweets, and continued with 482 tweets in the context of the subject. The results show that the tweets shared about healthcare professionals are clustered in five topics. According to the ratio of the relevant topics, these are; “information”, “struggle against vaccination and exemplary”, “violence”, “self sacrifice and trust” and “rights and special days”. “Self sacrifice and trust" and "rights and special days" are in the last two places in sharing rates. Nevertheless, these two topics are the second and third topics with the most likes and retweets on average. According to the results, the model can be reduced to words that summarize the views of the possessor of the relevant texts published in the local spoken language and make it possible to see the reaction it creates on the audience/reader emotionally. However, the model cannot fully reflect the motivational message that the shared messages give to the readers.

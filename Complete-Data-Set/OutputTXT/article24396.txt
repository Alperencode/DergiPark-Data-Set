Makale Başlığı: Prognostic Importance of Albumin Globulin Ratio in Small Cell Lung Cancer
Özet: Objectives: Inflammation has an important role for tumor development and also associated with poor prognosis in various cancer types. Albumin and globulin are two biomarkers that can reflect inflammation. However, albumin level can be affected in many conditions. Thus, albumin-globulin ratio (AGR) was found as a more successful biomarker for reflection of inflammation compared with albumin alone. In this article, we aim that investigated to the prognostic effect of AGR in small cell lung cancer (SCLC).Materials and Methods: We analyzed the patients who were diagnosed with SCLC between 2014-2018, retrospectively. AGR was calculated by divided albumin to globulin level at the diagnosis.  Cut off level for AGR was accepted as 1.2. Results: totally, 81 patients were enrolled to study. Percent of patients with AGR < 1.2 were 40.30% and AGR ≥ 1.2 were 50.30%. Patients characteristics were similar between the groups. We found that negative correlation between AGR and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio, significantly. Progression free survival and overall survival were longer in AGR ≥ 1.2 group. Conclusion: AGR is a cheap and easy biomarker. Thus, it can be used for prognostic biomarker for SCLC.

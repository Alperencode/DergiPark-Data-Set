Özet: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiologic results of primary Total Knee Arthroplasty(TKA) for elderly complex tibial plateau fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2010 to February 2012, six cases of elderly complex tibial plateau fractures were treated with primary TKA using the standard medial parapatellar approach. All six patients were available at follow up with mean duration of 32.3 months (range 25-41 months). There were 3 women and 3 men with an average age of 69.5 years (58-78 years) at the time of the arthroplasty. RESULTS: The mean Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score was 89.8（range 85-94）: 6/6 excellent. The mean knee flexion was 119.2°(105-130°). No significant postoperative complications were noted. None of these patients had significant postoperative knee pain required revision surgery, or had radiographic loosening of the components at the latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: TKA is a suitable solution for the treatment of elderly patients with complex tibial plateau fractures. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0423This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF THE RISKS IN WOOD HARVESTING ACTIVITIES BY THE PRELIMINARY HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)
Özet: The first step of the wood harvesting processis the harvesting that include cutting-felling, pruning, peeling, and bucking.These activities involve a variety of hazards, because of in the workenvironment, done and machines used. Forestry operations are among the mostdifficult and risky. Taking the necessary precautions is crucial to ensureoccupational health and safety in forest operations before the operations isdone that identification and classification of hazards posed by theseactivities. In this study, it is aimed to determine the hazards that the treescutting-felling, pruning and bucking activities carry in terms of occupationalhealth and safety and evaluate them according to the preliminary hazardanalysis (PHA) method. Preliminary hazard analysis method has been chosen asthe risk analysis methods because of the necessity of documentation is less inthe study, the ability to be done by an expert, the medium level of experienceand the application of each sector. The hazards of these activities have arerevealed by the literature survey and the field studies in the wood harvestingarea in the Black Sea, Central Anatolia and Mediterranean regions of theTurkey. Twenty-nine hazardous situations were identified in the study, of which12 were high risk, 9 were serious and 8 were intermediate risk. It is notpossible that the working environment and all hazards in the forests that areliving ecosystems and work material is heavy are completely removed.Intervening according to the importance classes of the hazards to minimize andthe level of the risk to decrease should be taken precautions that determinedin the study.

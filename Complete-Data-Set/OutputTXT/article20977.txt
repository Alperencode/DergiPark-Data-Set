Makale Başlığı: فرنسا ولعبتها الخطيرة في شرق البحر الأبيض المتوسط
Özet: This study analyses France’s current Eastern Mediterranean policy through its support of Greece against Turkey and its stands in Libya. The study also claims that; if this dangerous double standards policy, adopted by France in Eastern Mediterranean and Libya, is to lead to consequences, these consequences would be; supporting Russian stability in North Africa, endangering NATO's southern flank, and increasing the split within the EU by turning it into an ineffective actor in the region’s geopolitics. If the EU and NATO still want to stop France, they have to put an end to the extreme demands of France and Greece. We do not think that France, through these biased policies, can force Turkey to give up on its legitimate interests in Libya and Eastern Mediterranean

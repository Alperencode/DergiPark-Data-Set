Makale Başlığı: Public Law and the Economy: A Comparative View from the German Perspective
Özet: Since the entry into force of the Grundgesetz (GG), the Federal Republic of Germany’s constitutional law in the economic field oscillates around the idea of Soziale Marktwirtschaft (social market economy), which the GG does not explicitly include but which finds its way into the economic constitution via fundamental economic rights. Beneath constitutional theory, it is the concept of regulation that has been introduced into German administrative law in a differentiated and interesting process of legal “importation” using European Union law as a means of transmission. Regulation in this sense poses great challenges at both the constitutional and administrative levels concerning basic theoretical and practical issues. Furthermore, its internal and external limits lead to the question of how to address the ever growing plea for a return of state activity to the economy.

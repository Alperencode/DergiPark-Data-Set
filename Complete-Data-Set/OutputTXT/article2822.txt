Makale Başlığı: Thematic Comparison Between The II. Constitutional Period (1908-1920) and The Republic Period (1923-1950) Poems on Turanism
Özet: II. Constitutional Monarchy Period (1908-1920); although the Ottoman Empire experienced great territorial losses, it was a time period in which the Turkism movement became stronger and appeared in the political and socio-cultural field.The idea of Turanism, which Hungarian scientists developed as a geopolitical thesis in the 19th century, was understood differently by the Turkist intellectuals of the Ottoman Empire and evaluated as a Turkish unity.It is understood that it first developed in a romantic style during the II.Constitutional Era, and in 1923, it was discussed in the scientific dimension in Ziya Gökalp's work Türkçülüğün Esasları, and it was defined as the distant ideal of Turkism.Poetry as a literary genre has been seen as the most effective tool for the concept of Turan to be known, accepted and legitimized by the society.In this context, both knowing the thematic reflection of the idea of Turanism in Turkish poetry in the II. Constitutional Period (1908-1920) and the Republican Period (1923-1950) will fulfill an important task in order to reveal the meanings attributed to the concept. Based on this idea, in our study, the poems in which the ideas of Turanism were handled in both periods were determined and their thematic similarities and differences were revealed.

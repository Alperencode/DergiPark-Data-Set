Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Analysis of Clinical and Pathological Data of Vulvar IntraepitheliaI Neoplasia Cases
Özet: Aim: This study was designed to retrospectively evaluatethe clinical and pathological data of casesdiagnosed with Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN) in ourclinic.Material and Methods: 68 patients diagnosed with VIN at Pamukkale University between January 2016and June 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Pathological slides were examined with a microscope.Socio demographic data, biopsy and histopathological data of the cases were obtained. Cervical Papsmear,HPV and cervical biopsy results taken simultaneously to VIN cases were grouped and evaluated Results: Of the 68 patients included in the study, 48 were low grade (vLSIL) and 20 were high grade (vHSIL). The mean age in the vLSILgroup was 48,60±16,02; gravida 2,54±1,92; parity 2,02±1,60 while; 44,80±14,71; 2,40±1,81; 1,70±1,49 in the vHSIL group, respectively.In the vHSIL group; lesion area (p=0,008), Ki-67 (p=0,001), p53 (p=0,036), p16 (p=0,034) immunohistochemistry staining were statisticallysignificantly higher. There was no difference in HPV staining (p>0,05). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups interms of simultaneous cervical Pap-smear, HPV-pcr and cervical biopsy (p>0,05).Conclusion: In our study, in accordance with the literature, immunohistochemical markers were found to be higher in the vHSIL group, asin cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and VIN studies. Although it contains common risk factors with CIN, population-based screening forVIN is not yet available. Therefore, the gold standard procedure for diagnosis in the investigation of suspicious vulvar lesions is biopsy. Multicenter advanced studies are needed to create algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of VIN patients

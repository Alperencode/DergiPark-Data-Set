Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Social Work Field and Practice Education in the Curriculum of Social Work Departments
Özet: Practical courses in social work education are courses that aim to learn students' theoretical knowledge and intervention skills by doing. The quantity and quality of these courses in the social work education curriculum have been determined by international and national standards. In this research, it is aimed to evaluate the practice courses of 67 programs that provide formal social work undergraduate education in Turkey as of the fall semester of the 2020-2021 academic year, within the framework of "National Social Work Education Standards". For this purpose, data were collected by scanning the websites of the programs. It has been determined that practice courses in social work programs are mainly held in the seventh and eighth semesters, and most of the programs do not have any practice instructions on the websites about the practice courses (whether there is a coordinatorship for the courses, course hours, whether there is a practice guideline regarding the way the courses are conducted).It has been determined that practice courses in social work programs are mainly held in the seventh and eighth semesters, and most of the programs do not have any practice instructions on the websites about the practice courses (whether there is a coordinatorship for the courses, course hours, whether there is a practice guideline regarding the way the courses are conducted). It has been determined that the number of programs that visibly share a directive regarding the practice courses in their curriculum in accordance with the "National Social Work Education Standards" is 16 (24%). In an environment where all processes related to education and training have to be carried out online-based in the transition to distance education with Covid-19, there is only one program that publishes a clear and understandable guide on practice courses on its website. In addition, only 25% of the instructors in the programs have both undergraduate and graduate education in social work.

Özet: In the study, it was aimed to determine the views of nursing students about the compensatory training of a vocational course completedonline during the pandemic process. The descriptive study was conducted with 133 students who will study in the second-year of thenursing department of a state university. The data were collected online using the Descriptive Characteristics Form and the Opinion Formon the Practice Compensation after the compensatory training completed within two weeks. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon Signed RankTest and Kruskal Wallis Test were used for data analysis. It was determined that the students were generally satisfied with the compensatory training, and 39.1% of them stated that they participated in the compensatory training in order to practice skills one-on-one. After thecompensatory training, the students stated that they felt more competent, their self-confidence increased, and the compensatory trainingwas effective for learning. It was determined that there was a difference (p<0.05) between the students’ subjective evaluations of skillproficiency before and after compensatory training. Students suggested that more opportunities to practice should be offered for them.In the study, positive results have emerged regarding the compensatory training for the vocational course. It is recommended to planalternative practice opportunities for vocational courses completed remotely during the pandemic period.

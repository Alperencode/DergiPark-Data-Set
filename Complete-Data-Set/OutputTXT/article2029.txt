In this study, a reading and interpretation proposal is presented on the A50 Karban, A63 Kalbak – Tash XXIX, A66 Sogodek and A77 Bichikti – Boom X Inscriptions, which are among the Mountainous Altai Inscriptions. The A50 Karban Inscription discussed in the study was in 1988, the A63 Kalbak – Tash XXIX Inscription in 1994, the A66 Sogodek Inscription in 1995 and the A77 Bichikti Boom X Inscription in 2001. These inscriptions, which have found a place in various studies, have not been read until today. In the study, the inscriptions were evaluated based on the reading suggestions put forward for the related inscriptions. The word “ ” (e)t, which has a different meaning than meat, which is one of the words seen for the first time in the inscriptions in the suggested readings. This word evokes the Old Uighur word seen as etöz. This issue should also be evaluated. Various words that were rarely used in some inscriptions before were also witnessed.

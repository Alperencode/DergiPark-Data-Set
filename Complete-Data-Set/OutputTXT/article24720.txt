Makale Başlığı: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches in Lung Cancer: A Single Institution Experience on 96 Patients
Özet: Objective: To analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in lung cancer patients treated at a single institution.  Material and Method: Ninety six patients with histopathologically verified lung cancer diagnosed between 2007 and 2010 were retrospectively analyzed with respect to clinical, radiological and bronchoscopic findings.  Results: Male/Female ratio was 87/9, median age was 59 (45-74). Eighty two (85.4%) patients were smokers. The most frequent clinical findings were cough in 89.5%(n= 86), weight loss in 77.1%(n= 74), and phlegm in 70.8% (n= 68) of the patients. The most common findings on chest X-rays were mass in 93.7% (n= 90), mediastinal enlargement in 56.2%(n= 54), and atelectasis in 54.2%(n= 52). Histologic subtypes of the tumors were small cell lung cancers (SCLC) in 6 (6.3%), and non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) in 90 (93.7%). Bronchoscopic and radiologic examinations revealed that the primary tumor was located in the left lung in 56 patients (58.3%). During bronchoscopy the tumoral lesions were evaluated as endobronchial in 56.2% (n= 54)  and submucosal in 27.1% (n=26). The two diagnostic biopsy methods were fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) and transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB), their rates were 83.3% and 16.7% respectively. Based on the stage, SCLC patients were defined as limited in 2 patients (2.1%) and extensive stage in 4 (4.1%). NSCLC were considered operable in 41 (42.7%) patients and inoperable in 49 (51.0%). Metastases were detected in 25 patients (26.0%).  Conclusion: In this study we aimed to emphasize that lung cancer operations do not necessarily require specialized centers, and in patients suitable for surgery all types of lung cancer operations can be performed successfully in any state hospital staffed by a single or a few specialists, with very low morbidity and mortality rates.

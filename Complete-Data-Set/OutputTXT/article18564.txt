Makale Başlığı: Improving The Physical Stability Of Virgin Olive Oil Mayonnaise
Özet: Mayonnaise is a popular solid like sauce obtained typically from the ingredients; vegetable oil, vinegar, egg yolk, and salt. For mayonnaise production, vegetable oils with low costs are preferred. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), despite its high cost, is unique in that it has some very exceptional nutritional and sensorial properties and positive health promoting effects. However, EVOO mayonnaises pose some challenges in preparation and particu-larly in maintaining their stability for elevated periods. This study explored some options that could extend the shelf life of mayonnaise prepared from EVOO. For this purpose, two different stabilizer sodium alginate and gellan gum at two different concentrations (0.1% and 0.2%) were added to mayonnaise formulations, additionally ultrasound was applied at two different powers (40% and 70%) for 2 min. Rheological characterization revealed that all mayonnaise samples displayed a pseudoplastic behaviour which is desirable in condiments like mayonnaise. Particle size meas-urements revealed that oil particle diameters ranged between 2.1-25.5 μm. Real time and accelerated emulsion sta-bility measurement were in line with each other. According to these, sodium alginate resulted in mayonnaise with the highest physical stability. Real time emulsion stability measurements revealed that all samples except control main-tained their physical stability up to 20 days after preparation.

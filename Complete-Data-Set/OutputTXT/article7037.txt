Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMPLE OF SULEYMAN CELEBI EFFECT ON MAWLID: YENI MEVLID-I NEBEVI
Özet: Many works are written about the belief that Hz Prophet honored earth. These works, also called mawlid, are about his outstanding characteristics, miracles, and some specific important events in his life. There are generally poetic examples of these works while there are a few prose examples in the related literature. Mawlid type in Turkish literature is more popular in Turkish literature when compared to other Islamic literature types. Vesiletü’n-Necat written by Süleyman Çelebi is an important mawlid example that affected the literature. The sincere approach of Süleyman Çelebi and the valid reputation it owns affected almost all mawlids written after it. Muhyiddîn Mekki’s (d. 1936) work named Yeni Mevlid-i Nebevi is one of the mawlids that was written according to the language of the period and it was based on the model of Mawlid written by Süleyman Çelebi. Mekki edited and extremely shortened the Mawlid of Süleyman Çelebi in his work consisting of 246 couplets. New Mevlid-i Nebevi, was written in the shape of mesnevi verses and it is made of three main sections. There is a foreword, mawlid text, and a prosaic prayer section in the work. A short section consisting of information about the type of mawlid exists at the beginning of the article. Information about the author of New Mevlid-i Nebevi is presented in the next section; a comparison of the work with the work of Süleyman Çelebi is made. The purpose of this study is to present the deep impact of Süleyman Çelebi’s piece Vesiletü’n-Necat on mawlid texts in a concrete manner.

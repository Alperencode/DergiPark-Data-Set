Makale Başlığı: Effects of exceeding social carrying capacity on residents’ support for tourism: The mediating role of community participation and quality of life
Özet: This paper aims to examine how social carrying capacity (SCC) overrun in developing destinations affects support for tourism development (SDT). Besides, quality of life (QL) and the mediating role of community participation (CP) in this effect were examined. The basis of this structural relationship is based on the Social Exchange Theory (SET), the Tourist Area Life Cycle Model and the Irridex Model claimed by Doxey. The relationship between the relevant variables was tested by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The research universe is composed of all the local people living in Ürgüp, Goreme, Avanos, Uçhisar and Derinkuyu regions which are the most visited regions of Cappadocia. The data were obtained from the local people (N: 423) using stratified sampling, one of the probability-based sampling techniques. According to the results of the research, the perceived SCC overrun of the local people reduces SDT. Besides, QL and CP mediate the impact of SCC in the development of tourism. This paper contributes to the relevant literature revealing the negative effects of SCC overrun on SDT within the scope of SET.

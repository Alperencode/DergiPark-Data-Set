Makale Başlığı: HARDSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL LONG TERM NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS IN THE CONTEXT OF ICC AND UNIDROIT REGULATIONS
Özet: The concepts of hardship and force majeure and their consequences, have been regulated differently under different legal systems. Therefore it was considered reasonable to regulate the circumstances relating to the two concepts in order to prevent a confusion of terms that may arise in international commerce. However, since identifying these circumstances under domestic law would not put an end to similar problems, legal arrangements that were compatible with the requirements of international commerce, were required. The harmonization of the law of contracts has gained importance in the recent years, developing in parallel to the efforts of harmonization in private law and commerce law, there are certain important arrangements. The path to minimize the risk factors at international commerce leads through parties’ execution of international rules that have been prepared taking into consideration to international commerce and different legal systems, and these rules are finding a field of application in many legal disputes. Considering the duration of international long term natural gas contracts, parties are faced multiple problems and risks while executing contracts and as a consequence, it is important whether the necessary conditions have occurred to allow the adaptation of the contracts to the changing circumstances. The contracting parties who want to take measures by foreseeing risks of changing conditions at long term contracts and contracts of continuous performance, have different understandings of changing conditions, since they are having different nationalities and different legal systems. The parties considering this can take these measures with the provisions they will include in the contract, or they can make them a contractual provision by referring to some existing codes in this field. ICC arrangements and UNIDROIT principles appear as important resources in the field of international law in this context.

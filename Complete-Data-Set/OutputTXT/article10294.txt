The difference between mean age and gestational week values and the average number of people believing in COVID-19 myths (p=0.000; p=0.004), the mean scores obtained from COVID-19 anxiety (p=0.000; p=0.006) and perception of Health (p=0.008; p=0.036) scales was significant. The mean number of people believing in myths in unplanned pregnancies (p=0.011) and the mean score from COVID-19 anxiety scale (p=0.004) were higher.Conclusion: The level of belief in COVID-19 myths in pregnant women was found to be associated with anxiety and perception of health.

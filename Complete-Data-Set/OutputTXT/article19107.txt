Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF CARBON INSOLE USE ON FOOT PLANTAR PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PES PLANUS AND PES CAVUS
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using custom made carbon insoles on dynamic and static plantar pressure analysis in individuals with pes planus or pes cavus.Methods: Thirty volunteers who were prescribed to use insoles were included in the study, regardless of gender. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used for pain assessment, and the sensor medica pedobarographic device for dynamic and static plantar pressure analysis and Short Form-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire for quality of life. Personalized carbon insoles were produced and the participants were asked to use it for 6 months. Analyzes were performed with repeated measures Anova test at baseline, at 2 and 6 months.Results: Before using carbon insoles; In the first measurement, 2nd and 6th month VAS evaluations (p<0.001), dynamic pedobarographic measurement analyzes (p<0.05), other static pedobarographic measurement analyzes except the percentage of weight on the right and left feet (p<0.05) statistically significant difference was obtained. A statistically significant change was found in all subtitles of quality of life except social function (p<0.05).Conclusion: The use of personalized carbon insoles in individuals with pes planus or pes cavus; it has been determined that it reduces foot pain and has a positive effect on quality of life with static and dynamic plantar pressure analysis.

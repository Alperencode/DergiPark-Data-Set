Makale Başlığı: OVİNE AND BOVİNE LİVESTOCK İN TURKEY: THE CASE OF KÜTAHYA
Özet: In this study, between the years of 2007-2020, ovine and bovine breeding activities both in Turkey and in Kütahya are discussed. The data on the number of ovine and bovine and milk production amounts for the mentioned period were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) Regional Statistics. According to the data obtained, the number of ovine and bovine (excluding buffalo numbers) in Kütahya in the period between 2007-2020 has been undulated, and a similar situation is observed in the amount of sheep, goat and cow milk production. However, in the same period, both the number of buffaloes and the amount of buffalo milk production in Kütahya follow an increasing trend. In addition, the amount of buffalo milk production in Turkey has increased over the years in mentioned period.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Various Risk Factors Caused by Mechanized Equipment Used in Forest Operations
Özet: Forestry is among the dangerous work classes due to its working conditions. Especially fatal accidents that may occur during forest operations take an important place in this regard. In addition to occupational accidents, there are various risks such as physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic. These risks are often ignored and can cause serious health problems in long periods. Considering the previous studies on this subject, the main risk factors can be classified as noise, particulate matter and gas. The noise caused by motor movements and particulate matter exposure caused by wood raw material or machine-ground interaction are important conditions. The release of waste gases to the environment during operations are often encountered. The main gases polluting the air include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. CO is very dangerous because of its rapid mixing with the blood. In this study, a synthesis of previous studies in machine-based risk factors during forest operations was provided and Fine Kinney Method, as one of the most common risk assessment methods used in the subject, were presented. This review paper providing a synthesis of previous studies in machine-based risk factors pointed out the working conditions of forest workers, importance of personal protective equipment and how to use risk assessment methods in the purpose of occupational health and safety.

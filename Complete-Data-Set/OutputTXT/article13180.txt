Makale Başlığı: Expression Analysis of VvPDR Genes in Grape Berries
Özet: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) carrier membrane proteins are among the largest families of membrane proteins that are highly conserved in all organisms. The structure of eukaryotic ABC transporters consists of two domains called a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). In eukaryotes, it is classified into seven main families, ordered from ABCA to ABCG, and the main families are divided into subfamilies within themselves. They are localized in the membranes of a plant cell, such as the plasma membrane, tonoplast, chloroplast, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, and perform numerous functions. Initially identified as carriers involved in detoxification processes, they were later shown to be essential for organ growth, plant nutrition, plant growth, response to abiotic stress, pathogen resistance, and plant interaction with its environment. The plant pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) subgroup consists of full structure members of ABCG subfamily that have only been identified in fungi and plants. It has been reported in various studies that the PDR subfamily is involved in the transport of various lipids and hormones, as well as playing a role in abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, expressions of VvABCG35, VvABCG36, VvABCG37 genes belonging to the PDR subfamily, which are defined in Vitis vinifera sp. genome, during berry development periods were determined and other proteins with which they interact were examined by using the STRING database to have an idea about the functions of these genes.

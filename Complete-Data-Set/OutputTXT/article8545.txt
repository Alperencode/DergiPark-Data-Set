Makale Başlığı: CHARACTERIZATION OF CONSULTATIONS REQUESTED FOR PATIENTS WITH ELEVATED BLOOD EOSINOPHILS: A TERTIARY IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY CLINIC EXPERIENCE
Özet: Objective:  Blood  eosinophilia  has  become  a  common  labora-tory  abnormality  and  its  characterization  poses  a  dilemma  for  physicians.  As  a  result,  physicians  often  consult  specialists  in  immunology and allergy in order to evaluate patients with high eosinophils, with the general assumption of an underlying aller-gic  or  immunologic  cause.  However,  there  is  little  data  in  the  literature  regarding  consultations  requested  from  immunology  and allergy clinics because of eosinophilia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients who were consulted to the allergy clinic because of eosinophilia and detail the etiologies of eosinophilia.Methods: The medical records of 1366 patients consulted to the allergy clinic were evaluated retrospectively, and the data of 143 patients who were consulted for eosinophilia were investigated.Results:  The  median  (range)  eosinophil  count  was  2456  cells/mm3 (520-42920). 86 (60.1%) patients were classified as mild (500 to  1500  cells/mm3),  44  (30.8%)  patients  as  moderate  (1500  to  5000  cells/mm3),  and  13  (9.1%)  patients  as  severe  (≥5000  cells/mm3)  eosinophilia.  The  most  frequently  consulted  departments  were   chest   diseases   (37.1%),   internal   medicine   (34.2%),   and   dermatology   (14.7%),   respectively.   While   the   most   common   clinical symptoms at presentation were cough, dyspnea, pruritus, rhinitis,  and  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  49  (34.3%)  patients  were  asymptomatic.  The  mean±SD  vitamin  B12  and  tryptase  levels  were  424.2±240.5  pg/mL,  and  4.48±1.76  ng/mL,  respectively.  The  median  total  IgE  level  was  150  IU/mL  (1.5-9464).  Atopy  was identified in 26.6% (n=38) of the patients. Among 143 eosinophilia patients, there were no patients diagnosed with myeloproliferative or  lymphocytic  variants  of  hypereosinophilic  syndrome  (HES),  eight  patients  were  diagnosed  with  idiopathic  HES.  While  the  most common underlying causes were asthma (n=38) and allergic rhinitis (n=20), 30 patients had non-allergic causes.Conclusion:  Although  parasitic  infections  and  allergic  diseases  are  the  first  etiologies  that  come  to  mind  when  eosinophilia  is  detected  in  a  patient,  a  specific  anamnesis  and  advanced  di-agnostic  tests  for  differential  should  be  performed  in  order  to  detect other underlying or accompanying conditions apart from these diseases.

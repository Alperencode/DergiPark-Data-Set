Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMPLE OF MAURICE RAVEL'S UNDERSTANDING OF ORCHESTRAL TRANSCRIPTION: PAVANE POUR UNE INFANTE DÉFUNTE
Özet: Maurice Ravel (1875-1937), French composer, pianist and conductor, is one of the most important composers of the 20th century. In Ravel's works for piano, the effects of impressionism come to life with the use of all the colors of the instrument. In orchestral work, these effects are enlivened by various tones and colors obtained by combining instruments with different colors and characteristics individually or in different groups. With this article, ‘Pavane pour une infante défunte’ (Pavane for the Dead Princess), which is one of the works designed by Maurice Ravel for piano and later given a new identity with its orchestration, is intended to reveal Ravel's understanding of orchestration by studying in terms of orchestration techniques. The article will focus on the principles that the composer pays attention to when performing orchestral transcribing from the piano writing. In Ravel’s orchestration, it is aimed to create an example of orchestral transcription by addressing topics such as the balance factor and the methods, used to create various colors, the creation of contrast between the musical ideas and the techniques, used in expressing musical ideas and feelings via orchestration.

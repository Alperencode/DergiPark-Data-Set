Makale Başlığı: YOUTH AND SPORTS DAY CELEBRATIONS IN BOLU (1936-1950)
Özet: Due to the occupation movements that started all over Anatolia after the Armistice of Mondros and the fact that the Ottoman Administration was unresponsive to these initiatives, Mustafa Kemal Pasha went on the way of organizing the National Struggle by going to Samsun on May 19, 1919. In this way, this date, which symbolizes the first important step taken towards the liberation of Anatolia and the Turkish nation, has literally become the beginning of the process leading to the proclamation of the republic and the revolutions. Both this event, which began to be celebrated on the territory of the country, and the sporting events for young students, which became traditional during the process stretching from the First World War to the republican period and are held in May every year, eventually led to the emergence of the “Youth and Sports Holiday” by the law passed by the Parliament in 1938. Undoubtedly, the importance given by Gazi Mustafa Kemal and the new Turkish state to youth and sports activities was largely instrumental in the emergence of this holiday. On the occasion of the holiday, a close bond was established betweenMustafa Kemal Pasha's first fundamental step towards the liberation of the country by decamping to Samsun and the Turkish youth to whom he entrusted the future of the country.The celebrations of the “Youth and Sports Day” held in Bolu on the occasion of this study have been examined. On the occasion of these events in the city of Bolu, the journey of Mustafa Kemal Pasha, leaning on the sin of the Turkish nation, has been commemorated every year with enthusiasm and excitement. Young people representing the future of the country took part in these celebrations with their sporting shows that they performed as an expression of intelligence and strength. The holiday celebrations, which brought together the official decency, the people and the young people, played an important role in strengthening the national consciousness, strengthening the understanding of unity and togetherness and demonstrating the sporting abilities of young people in Bolu, as well as in the whole country.

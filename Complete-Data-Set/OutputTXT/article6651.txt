Makale Başlığı: RADICALIZATION IN CYBERSPACE AND PANOPTIC SURVEILLANCE OF THE INTERNET
Özet: The fact that the use of cyberspace, easily connects individuals to a wider audience in a rapid sense  and creates an interaction network, creates a movement and synergy with like-minded people. In terms of terrorism conceptualization, this creates a transformative effect on protest, propaganda, financing, recruitment, education and action planning in the context of radicalization. In such environment, various groups gain freedom of movement through the existence of applications that provide anonymity. Control and surveillance in this highly interactive environment also creates an area of concern for state actors. The concept of the panopticon, which was designed by Samuel Bentham in 1785, based on the idea of Jeremy Bentham, was also studied by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. This concept means to monitor the whole, and the notion of surveillance, which is depicted as an important element of power, affects the idea of controllability of the masses in many areas, especially in the physical area. As individuals can be radicalized within cyberspace, this study aims to raise awareness in the context of the use of mass surveillance in fighting radicalization there. In this study, in accordance with the aforementioned purpose, a discussion will be made on the use of mass surveillance of the internet in fighting radicalization within the framework of the panopticon conceptualization. In this study, through review of the relevant literature, the descriptive method will be used and the activism of state actors towards mass surveillance of the internet, in the context of the existence of radicalization in cyberspace, will be discussed.

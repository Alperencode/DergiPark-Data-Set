Second, the interpretation and comments of main tourism stakeholders' concerning the effect of the war between Russia and Ukraine on tourism were analyzed, interpreted, and reported. Research findings show that Russia and Ukraine are two critical actors for tourism in Antalya. However, the number of visitors from Russia and Ukraine decreased after the war.

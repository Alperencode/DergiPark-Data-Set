Makale Başlığı: The Enforcement of Majalla in Arabic Countries
Özet: In 19th century, as a result of centralization on the governence, endeavor on codification and unification of legislation accelerated in Ottoman Empire like as Continental Europe. In that time, there were some Codes adapted from European Countries with the idea of westernization and some national Ottoman Codes were promulgated. The leading one of these national Codes was the Majalla deemed as Ottoman Civil Code. This Code which held qualification of Islamic private law’s codification, marked an era in history of fiqh (Islamic Law) and triggered codifications in Islamic states. The Code which put in force in Arabic Countries as were counties of Ottoman Empire, at the same time with the Capital, did not lose its effect by the occupation and mandate after the First World War, and countinued to be in force in those countries. Even though it repealed by the enforcement of national Codes, the Majalla continued to affect doctrine of law in these countries for a while. Even though Majalla had not been implemented in Egypt, Egyptian practice which has similar transformation with Majalla, should be exemined in this context to determine Majalla’s impact on civil code’s transformation in Islamic countries.

Makale Başlığı: Molecular determination of antibiotic resistance properties of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains isolated natural yogurts
Özet: Objective: In this study, the detection of phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance for Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains isolated from natural yogurts was aimed.Materials and method: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains were isolated from natural yogurt and kept in the Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Food Engineering Department, Biotechnology laboratory stocks of which characterizations were determined phenotypically (with disc diffusion) and genotypically (with PCR).Discussion and conclusion: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus isolates were found to have the highest resistance against kanamycin (51%), followed by streptomycin (11%), chloramphenicol (10%) and vancomycin (8%). As the result of PCR applications to examine antibiotic resistance genes, aph(3')-IIIa (95%), str (B) (36%), blaZ (100%) and van (E) (67%) genes were found. Utilizing the disc diffusion method, the aph(3')-IIIa region was found in 60% of kanamycin-resistant strains, the str(B) region was found in 36% of streptomycin-resistant strains, the van(E) region was found in 44% of vancomycin-resistant strains, and the BlaZ region was found in all penicillin-resistant strains. Resistance genes were detected in 51% of the isolates examined to be resistant by disc diffusion. With this study, it can be concluded that some foodborne bacteria may be reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Activities of Daily Living and Community Integration in Individuals with Age-Related Hearing Loss
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine the activities of daily living and community integration of individuals with presbycusis. Material and Methods: The study included 90 individuals (65+) in total (30 with hearing loss and refusing to use device, 30 with hearing loss, 30 without hearing loss). The individuals participating in the study were evaluated using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Mayers' Lifestyle Questionnaire (MYQ3), Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly (HHIE) and Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ-R). Results: In HHIE, the results of individuals without hearing loss were found higher than those who used or refused to use devices (p>0.05). There wasn’t difference between the groups in the performance and satisfaction scores in the COPM and the MYQ3 sub-parameters (p>0.05). While there wasn’t significant difference in home participation and social participation in CIQ-R (p>0.05), the results of individuals without hearing loss in productivity, electronic and social networking were found higher than individuals using devices (p>0.05). Discussion: Among the groups, it was observed that the two groups with hearing impairment had more difficulty in using technological products in COPM. Supporting individuals with presbycusis with correct device use and occupational therapy approaches is important in terms of independence.

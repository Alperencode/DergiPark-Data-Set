Makale Başlığı: Rare Tumor Of The Spermatic Cord: Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma
Özet: A heterogeneous solid mass in the spermatic cord was detected in Magnetic Resonance imaging in a 70-year-old patient who presented with a palpable mass in the left inguinal canal. Pathology result after radical orchiectomy was reported as Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH). MFH is mostly seen in the extremities and retroperitoneum, rarely found in the spermatic cord. Its etiopathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, and radical orchiectomy is performed in the treatment. There is no proven treatment method for adjuvant therapy. We aimed to present this rare case in the spermatic cord with the aim of contributing to the literature and defining the treatment plan.

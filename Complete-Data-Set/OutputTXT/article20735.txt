Makale Başlığı: The role of environmental patents in environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis in Turkey: Evidence from the augmented ARDL
Özet: This study investigates the relationship between energy sector emissions and economic growth, population, energy consumption, and patents obtained from environmental technologies in Turkey within the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework and STIRPAT model. To do so, we use the Augmented ARDL approach proposed by McNown et al. (2018) and Sam et al. (2019). Considering the 2001 crisis in Turkey, we add a dummy variable to the cointegration equation. As a main result of the empirical analysis, we explored the EKC hypothesis is valid in Turkey, considering the energy sector emissions. Furthermore, our findings reveal that economic growth, population, and environmental patents increase emissions. With the help of dummy variable, we validate the impact of the critical year (2001) which reduces environmental degradation. As a result, policymakers should devote more budgets and develop incentives to green technologies. In addition to these, training should be given to increase the environmental awareness of individuals, and arrangements should be made to integrate the education system with sustainable environmental issues.

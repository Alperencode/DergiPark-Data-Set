Makale Başlığı: Qualitative Determination of Bisphenol A and Phthalate Residues in Drinking Water Alternatives in Kayseri Province of Türkiye
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to qualitatively determine Bisphenol A and dibutyl phthalate residues in carboy, pet bottled and tap waters used as drinking water in Kayseri-Türkiye. Being used as an additive in the production of many products and plastics frequently used in daily life, BPA and phthalates are associated with a variety of health issues and environmental problems. Within the scope of this study, a total of 20 drinking water samples (9 pet, 7 carboy and 4 tap water) were analyzed in terms of dibutyl phthalat (DBP), BPA and BPA derivatives (Bisphenol S and Bisphenol F). Among the pet bottled water samples; 8 (88.88%) were found to be contaminated with BPA, 5 (55.55%) with DBP and 7 (77.77%) with BPA derivatives, while 1(14.28%) of the carboy water samples were found contaminated with BPA and 7(100%) with DBP. Among the tap water samples, 2 (50%) were contaminated with BPA and 4 (100%) with DBP. No BPA derivatives were found in carboy and tap water samples while pet bottled waters were found posi- tive for all three contaminants. On the other hand, all carboy and tap waters were found contaminated with phthalates. The findings of this study reveal that the most variety of contamination for these chemicals is determined in pet bottled waters. This study highlighted the situation of BPA and phthalate residues in drinking water sources. Measures should be taken to prevent the contamination of all types of drinking water and to systematically examine the BPA and phthalate-related safety of drinking waters. Further investigation is needed to determine and quantify the occurrence of the target compounds.

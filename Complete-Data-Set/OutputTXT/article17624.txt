Makale Başlığı: Natural and anthropogenic driving forces on Holocene coastline evolution of Lake Van (Eastern Anatolia): A geological approach
Özet: Coastal areas of the lakes are quite sensitive to climatic, hydrologic, and anthropogenic changes. These areas are also an indicator that reveals the interaction between natural driving forces and anthropogenic factors. Lake Van coastal region is a dynamic area heavily affected by the natural processes and human activities. The present study focuses on coastline evolution and associated driving forces of the Lake Van. Natural driving forces influencing the changes in the coastline were determined as rock type, water-level fluctuations, wave and current action, tectonics, and fluvial-based processes. The eastern coasts of lake are identified as the most intensive region for the erosion and deposition in terms of natural factors.Most of the residents prefer to live in the coastal areas of the Lake Van, likely large percentage of the world's population choice. Coastal settlements and their coastal protection structures such as embankments and harbours negatively affect the natural processes such as erosion, sediment transportation, and deposition. Dams and river reclamation channels in rivers indirectly affect the coastal evolution by reducing the sediment input into the lake. These anthropogenic stressors on coastal evolution completely change the natural balance. Understanding of all these environmental factors is an indicator for the existing circumstances of the Lake Van coastal area and provides wider perspective to assess of protection and management of this area.

Makale Başlığı: Computational Music Theory
Özet: This article is an introduction to computational music theory. Music theory examines the structure of music at the neutral level through its dimensions: melody, harmony, rhythm and meter, timbre, texture and form. Computational music theory uses the language of mathematics, algorithms and computational power to examine music. This examination includes both static modelling of musical structures and dynamic modelling of musical processes. The use of computational power in music theory —not at the sound level, but at the symbolic level, i.e.,  at the level of notes and higher abstractions— is relatively new. MIDI, MusicXML and similar formats have become popular forms of musical information exchange for music at symbolic level. We define “computability” and examine music theoretical concepts relevant to analytical processing of musical information. We review recent mathematical and computational models for music. These models include the Rubato line of research, i.e., mathematical music theory which has been in continuous development on since 1980’s. The example we will examine in detail is both a mathematical and a computational model for analysis of harmony and meter and associated software implementations on Rubato, a Java-based music composition and analysis framework. Results show that detailed experiments on musical information is possible for testing various theses about music theory via computational modelling of musical information.

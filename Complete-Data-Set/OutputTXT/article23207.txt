Makale Başlığı: Determination of the Effects of Extracts Obtained from Seeds and Leaves of Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) Plant on Germination Parameters of Some Plants
Özet: Diseases, pests and weeds are seen in the areas where crop production is carried out causing significant crop losses. Due to the increasing environmental awareness all over the world, it has become important to use alternative practices instead of chemical control against weeds in order to eliminate the negative effects of synthetic drugs used in agricultural struggle on human health and the environment. One of these alternative methods is the use of naturally sourced compounds with allelopathic effects on weeds. It is known that sorghum has the potential to be used in the control of weeds thanks to its secondary metabolite compounds. Gözde 80, Erdurmuş and Aldarı sorghum cultivars were used in this study to determine the effects of sorghum water extract on both weed and cultivated plant growth. Wheat, grass, corn, fodder peas were used as cultivars and purslane and red-rooted cockscomb plants as weeds were used to determine the allelopathic effects of sorghum cultivars. 3 and 5% water solutions obtained from sorghum cultivars were applied on some cultivated plants and weeds and germination rate, root and shoot length, fresh and dry weight observations were taken. As a result, it was determined that especially the herbal water extracts of Erdurmuş cultivar significantly reduced the germination of wheat, red-rooted cockscomb and purslane compared to the control group, and also significantly regressed the root and shoot length, one of the germination parameters of corn plant.

Makale Başlığı: CONFRONTATIONS WITH MODERNISM IN TEKİRDAĞ: ARCHITECTURE, CONCRETE AND THE RUIN
Özet: Ruin, which means “old building” or “ruined or destroyed building or city” in Arabic, and is derivedfrom the Latin word ruere which means “fall”, has been addressed by many thinkers in the context of theirpotential to generate new meanings of nature and death in terms of sublime, aesthetics, and nostalgia. Modernruin creates a process of suspending time, involving an active participant who, in Sotomayor’s words, witnessesthe change and destruction of the material, into the aging and decomposition of the building.This article focuses on the relationship between modernity and ruin and examines these relations through fourconcrete buildings located on the Tekirdağ-Marmara Ereğlisi highway, which stand out with their modernistlanguages and have managed to survive today: Başak Sigorta Education and Summer Resort, Şeker KampSummer Resort, Güneş Sigorta Education and Summer Resort, and Bağkur Summer Resort that were built inthe 1960s and 1980s.These buildings used by insurance employees in the summer gain importance in Tekirdağ’s several modernarchitectural heritage examples and have been abandoned by the owners since the 2000s. Since then, thesebuildings have resisted extinction with their simple layouts, pilotis and reliefs, or survived by changing theirfunctions and they both exist as a “building and a ruin”. Thus, these modernist buildings, which create theimpression that they “always survive”, bring up the contradiction of concrete and the ruin.

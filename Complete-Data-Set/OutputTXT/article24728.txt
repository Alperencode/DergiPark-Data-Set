Makale Başlığı: The Case of Nonimmune Hydrops Fetalis Due to Simple Lung Cyts
Özet: Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is a serious fetal condition in which abnormal fluid accumulates in at least two different fetal compartments, and in which circulating antibodies against fetal red-cell antigens are absent in the mother. NIHF is mostly associated with chromosomal disorders, cardiac malformations, arrhythmias, fetal anaemia and TORCH infections. The incidence of NIHF is approximately 1:2500 to 1:3500 births, although in some series the incidence is as high as approximately 1 in 200 pregnancies. Still, the prognosis in NIHF is poor, with perinatal mortality rates that range from 50% to more than 90% in several series. In this case, we desired to emphasize the importance of revising prognostic factors and to draw attention to early intrauterin intervention in NIHF due to simple lung cyst.

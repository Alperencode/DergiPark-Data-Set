Makale Başlığı: A Systematic Overview of Adolescents’ Smartphone Habits and Internet Addiction  During the COVID-19 Era
Özet: In order to prevent the spread of the virus during the Covid-19 epidemic period, measures such as maintaining social distance, quarantine practices, and keeping schools closed have been taken in many countries. In this process, individuals' internet use has also increased in order to restore interpersonal relationships that have decreased with staying at home. In addition, the transfer of educational activities, which are risky to be carried out face-to-face during the epidemic period, to online platforms, as in many countries, brought about an increase in the time spent on devices with internet providers in adolescents. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the results of studies examining the concepts of internet and smartphone addiction in relation to the use of the internet in the Covid-19 period. In this context, in this systematic review, "What is the status of adolescents' smartphone and internet addictions in the Covid-19 Era?" The question has been tried to be answered. As a result of the searches made in the databases, fourteen studies were reached and these studies were examined in depth. The findings showed that adolescents’ internet/smartphone addictions were higher than before the epidemic, the prevalence of internet/smartphone addictions increased in general, and internet/smartphone addictions were associated with adolescents' mental disorders and problems.

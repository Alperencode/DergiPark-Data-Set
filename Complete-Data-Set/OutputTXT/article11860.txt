Makale Başlığı: TRANSITION PERIOD CEREMONIES OF CRIMEAN TATAR TURKS LIVING IN ESKISEHIR: BIRTH, WEDDING AND DEATH
Özet: There are three important periods in human life. These are birth, marriage and death. Many ceremonies take place around these periods, which are called "Transitional Periods" in folklore. With the repetition of these ceremonies, it is ensured that traditions are formed and that they are not lost in the past, and that they are transferred to future generations at the same time. Within the scope of the study carried out with the aim of determining the ceremonies performed during these periods by the Crimean Tatar Turks living in Eskişehir, a field study was conducted with 20 source people using observation and interview techniques. Snowball sampling technique was used to reach the interviewees. In the light of the information given by the interviewees during the field research, it has been tried to determine whether their traditions, customs, beliefs and customs are similar to today's beliefs and practices and whether the ceremonies that took place are still continuing. As a result, it has been determined that the birth and death traditions continue today, and many ceremonies for marriage no longer exist today. It has also been determined that the tradition of "tepreş", which is of great importance for the Crimean Tatar Turks, still continues by the Crimean Tatar Turks living in Eskişehir and other provinces other than Eskişehir.

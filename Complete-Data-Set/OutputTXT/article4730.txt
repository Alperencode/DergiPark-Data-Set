Özet: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of the Reality Therapy based psychoeducation program on the psychological need satisfaction and subjective well-being levels of the teachers. The study was conducted with paired experimental and control groups with pre, post and follow up tests with a quasi-experimental, 2x3 factorial design. Within the scope of the study, a six sessions psychoeducation program was developed, and the developed program was administered to the teachers on a once-a-week basis. As data collection instruments, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Psychological Needs Inventory were used. The data were analyzed with mixed-design ANOVA. As a result of the study, it was observed that for the experimental group that received the psychoeducation program, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Positive Affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Psychological Needs Inventory were scores of participants were significantly increased compared to the control group, whereas the Negative Affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores were significantly decreased compared to the control group.

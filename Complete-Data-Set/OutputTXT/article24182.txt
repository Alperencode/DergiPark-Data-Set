Makale Başlığı: Our histological results of the eyelids and conjunctiva tumour
Özet: INTRODUCTION: To review the histopathologic outcomes of our tumour excisions from eyelid and conjunctiva.METHODS: Forty-six hematological malignancy patients under induction and consolidation chemotherapy that expected We retrospectively studied the age, gender, tumour excision localization, and histopathologic outcomes of 81 patients who had undergone eyelid or conjunctiva tumour excision surgery between January 2012 and January 2015.RESULTS: Our study analyzed data of 81 patients, 37 (%46) of whom were male and 44 (%54) of whom were female. The mean age was 46,3 ± 18,9 (3-84 ) years. Sixteen patients had undergone conjunctiva tumour excision, 65 patients undergone eyelid tumour excision. From the cases who had eyelid tumour, 11 had squamous papilloma, 22 had intradermal nevus, 2 had seborrheic keratosis, 2 had epidermal inclusion cycst, 6 had inflammatory lesion, 1 had capillary hemangioma, 2 had xanthelasma, 3 had dermoid cycst, 2 had verruca vulgaris, 4 had sebaceous cycst, 1 had benign ecrine tumour, 1 had keratoacanthoma, 1 had pilomatrixoma. From the malignant tumours, 5 cases had basal cell carcinoma, 1 case had basosquamous cell carcinoma, 1 case had sebaceous glang carcinoma. From the conjunctiva tissues 4 pterygium, 6 conjunctival melanocytic lesion, and 6 pyogenic granuloma were observed.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The histopathologic diagnosis of eyelid and conjunctiva tumours might be affected by race, age, gender, residence, sunlight exposure, and the clinical research hospital's being a reference center.

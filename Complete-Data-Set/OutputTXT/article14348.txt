Makale Başlığı: THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WORK VALUES NETWORKING BEHAVIOR AND QUALITY OF WORK LIFE
Özet: The purpose of this study is to explore the direction of the association between work values and networking behavior by treating quality of work life as a mediator in contrast to how it is used in majority of previous studies. Analytical type of research design was used, and the data were collected from 304 participants. Three measurement devices were employed: Schwartz’s Portrait Values Questionnaire, Quality of Work Life questionnaire by Sirgy, and Aizen’s Networking Behavior Questionnaire. Four important outcomes are: 1. Intrinsic and social work values are effective in shaping networking behavior; 2. Quality of work life is mediated the relationship between work values and networking behavior; 3. The perceived quality of work life by the employees is not satisfactory and 4. The prioritized needs for male employees are aesthetics and self-actualization, while for female employees, these are knowledge and economics-family. The current study provides empirical evidence for demonstrating the direction of the association between work value orientations, quality of work life and networking behaviors of employees in organizations as well as the mediator effect of the quality of work life in the association between work values and networking behaviors of the members of organizations.

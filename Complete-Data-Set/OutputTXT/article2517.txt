Makale Başlığı: SWOT Analysis for Tree and Forest Products Businesses Operating in Bartın
Özet: The forest products industry is an important employment and economic development sector, and small and medium-sized enterprises mainly carry out production activities. With the increasing consumption due to industrialization in recent years, it has become necessary to use raw materials and natural resources more carefully. This situation has revealed the need to make analyzes for businesses operating in the forest products sector.In this study, SWOT analysis was carried out in order to determine the internal and external environmental effects affecting the forest industry enterprises operating in Bartın and SWOT factors were created for the enterprises on a sectoral basis. In this context, a total of 56 companies registered with the Bartın Chamber of Commerce and Industry were identified, and a face-to-face survey was applied to 30 of these companies. As a result of the survey, 8 factors related to strengths, 11 factors related to weaknesses, 12 factors related to opportunities and 14 factors related to threats were determined. When the results were examined in general, it was determined that the strongest aspect of the enterprises in Bartın was to produce quality workmanship and personalized designs, and the weakest aspect was that the enterprises could not benefit from R&D activities sufficiently. While businesses see the projects realized/to be realized in Bartın and the surrounding provinces as the biggest opportunity, the lack of transportation and infrastructure in Bartın has been the biggest factor threatening the businesses.

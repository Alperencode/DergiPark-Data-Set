Makale Başlığı: Refik Fersan as a Composer and an Analysis on Arazbarbuselik Instrument Semai
Özet: In this study, maqam analysis for Refik Fersan's Arazbarbuselik Saz Semai, which has not been studied before, is realized. The reasons for choosing this piece can be listed as the fact that this piece is one of the most difficult works written for the tambour, it is considered as one of the important pieces that synthesize Turkish and Western Music, and that the piece is different from the normal saz semai forms. To make a maqam analysis, the work is handled by analyzing it in measures. In addition, the method of source research was used to give information about the period in which the composer lived. Although the tambour, mastered by Refik Fersan, is an instrument played dignified in tradition, it took a more dynamic playing style with Tamburi Cemil Bey, and his student, Refik Fersan, carried it to a point that pushes the boundaries of the instrument with the work examined in the study. The composition of Arazbarbuselik maqam by the composer, which is a rarely used maqam, is an example to explain the maqams better to contemporary artists and performers and to encourage the use of less used maqams. In this study, as a qualitative research method, the version of Refik Fersan's work, which was notated by Ferhat Devecioğlu, was used.

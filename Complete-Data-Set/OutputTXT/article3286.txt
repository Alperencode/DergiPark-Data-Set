Makale Başlığı: Chronological Problems of the Adana Taşköprü
Özet: One of the most important settlements of Cilicia, which is an important connection point between East and West, is Adana. The international road route, which reaches Tarsus and then Adana via Gülek, turns east from here. Located on this route, Taşköprü (= Stone Bridge) provides a connection over the Sarus river. Although the arches of the bridge, which consists of twenty-one spans together with the discharging arches, vary in form, the architectural style generally exhibits Roman features. The bridge, which is known to have been repaired many times after the first construction, contains arches from different periods as well as early period remains. Although it is generally accepted that its construction was carried out in the Roman Period, it is controversial when exactly it should be dated to and which Imperial period. Some researchers associate the bridge with the historical context and date it to the Hadrianic Period. On the other hand, a group of researchers think that the bridge was built in the IVth century A.D., based on the name of the Architect Auxentios mentioned in the inscription. The aim of the study is to make a new proposal about when Taşköprü was built. Considering the importance of the road it connects and the political process, it turns out that both dates suggested for the structure are too late. In addition, the discharging arches on the bridge piers allow for a more accurate dating of the structure. In short, considering the architectural features and the political process, it becomes possible to determine the construction date of the bridge and to make a new proposal.

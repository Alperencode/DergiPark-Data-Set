Makale Başlığı: Analytic functions associated with cardioid domain
Özet: In this article, we define and study new domain for analytic functions which is named as cardioid domain for being of cardioid structure. Analytic functions producing cardioid domain are defined and studied to some extent. The Fekete-Szegö inequality is also investigated for such analytic functions.

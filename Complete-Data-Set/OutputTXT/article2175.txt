Makale Başlığı: A New Model-Agnostic Method and Implementation for Explaining the Prediction on Finance Data
Özet: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in critical mission systems such as healthcare, self-driving vehicles and the army, which directly affect human life, and in predicting data related to these systems. However, the black-box nature of ANN algorithms makes their use in mission-critical applications difficult, while raising ethical and forensic concerns that lead to a lack of trust. The development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) day by day and gaining more space in our lives have revealed that the results obtained from these algorithms should be more explainable and understandable. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of AI that supports a set of tools, techniques, and algorithms that can create high-quality interpretable, intuitive, human-understandable explanations of artificial intelligence decisions. In this study, a new model-agnostic method that can be used for the financial sector has been developed by considering the stock market data for explainability. This method enables us to understand the relationship between the inputs given to the created model and the outputs obtained from the model. All inputs were evaluated individually and combined, and the evaluation results were shown with tables and graphics. This model will also help create an explainable layer for different machine learning algorithms and application areas.

Makale Başlığı: ENGELSİZ ÜNİVERSİTE SÖYLEMİ ve KIRKLARELİ ÜNİVERSİTESİ SOSYAL YAŞAM ALANININ ENGELLİLER İÇİN ERİŞİLEBİLİRLİĞİNİN BELİRLENMESİ
Özet: Today, both the universal declaration of human rights, the international agreements, and national laws and regulations define comprehensive rights and allow positive discrimination for the disadvantaged people in society when necessary. However, the difficulties experienced by disabled people regarding their participation in social life and having basic human rights are not because of the imperfection of laws and regulations, but to the inability to implement them. The disability law, which was enacted in 2005 but could not be fully implemented, is a good example of this situation. The concept of disability-friendly university, which has become popular recently, represents the upper part of the pyramid in terms of education, and in the simplest terms, means that disabled people can use their rights in the best way possible within the university campus. In this study, the accessibility of social areas in Kırklareli University, especially for wheelchair users, was examined. Kırklareli University received the orange flag award for 3 different buildings. This is an indication that the university is not unconcerned about the accessibility of disabled pepole. As a result of the examination, it can be said that the social life infrastructure is substantially accessible. However, some aspects that are open to improvement have been identified and solutions have also been presented.

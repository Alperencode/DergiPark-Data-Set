Makale Başlığı: Art Psychotherapy and Theoretical Bases: A Case Study
Özet: The concept of art, which started with dancing and drawing on cave walls in the early ages, developed and deepened over time with its own evolutionary process. While trying to understand the depths of life, the evolving human also dived into his own depths and discovered his spiritual structure. This discovery showed that some diseases can be treated without the use of drugs and surgical methods, and created the concept of therapy. The psychodynamic theory has emerged as the most basic therapy approach in which the psychological structure of the human being is analyzed in depth. Theories explaining the mental structure in accordance with the zeitgeist have diversified and be- nefited from each other. Today, art therapy has taken its place in the field as a discipline used in many psychotherapy approaches. In this context, it is of great importance to examine art in terms of psychodynamic orientation, in which the spiritual structure is dealt with in depth. On the other hand, the literature has limited resources in Turkish on this subject. The aim of this study is to provide a Turkish source for the theory in the literature, especially by conveying the important points about the subject through a case study. In this review article, which was handled for this purpose, the foundations of the concepts of art and therapy, the theoretical journey of psychodynamic art therapy and some research results in the literature were tried to be conveyed and suggestions were made for studies to be done in order to eliminate the limitation of Turkish resources on this subject.

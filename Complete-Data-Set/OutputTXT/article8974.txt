Makale Başlığı: A Roadmap to Certification of Parts and Appliances in Aviation
Özet: Flight safety means all arrangements intended to control safety risks during the flight of an air vehicle, and to protect persons, public and private property, and the environment, against any damage that might be caused by in-flight maneuvers of this aircraft. The process carried out to ensure flight safety can be called airworthiness certification. Therefore, all parts and appliances to be installed on an aviation product (aircraft, engine, or propeller) having a type or supplementary type certificate, must also be approved. This reveals the necessity of designing and manufacturing all equipment to be fitted to an aircraft in accordance with an approved design standard. Certification of parts and appliances in aviation is a process in which parts and appliances are officially approved by the certification authorities in a documented manner that agrees they are designed and produced in accordance with the published technical specifications. This article, it is aimed to explain the technical and procedural activities that the certification authorities expect to be carried out within the scope of parts and appliances certification in aviation. In addition, this study, it is aimed to contribute to the lack of Turkish source material in order to shed light on the companies that want to perform parts and appliances certification in our country.

Makale Başlığı: Understanding  Karabakh Through the Eyes of Women
Özet: Many discourses were expressed about the Karabakh conflict, which has been going on between the states of Armenia and Azerbaijan for about 32 years. However, most of these discourses approach the events from a political point of view. Undoubtedly women are among those most affected by the Karabakh war. Therefore, the main goal is to understand Karabakh from the eyes of women who lived in the war that happened between 1988-1994 and in September and November 2020 and reveal the belief in the solution to the Karabakh problem. Almost all the women who experienced the war in the region before the Karabakh War, particularly until the start of the 1988 conflicts, stated that they had very well neighboring relations with the Armenians. However, after the Khojaly and Kalbajar massacres, they indicated that it would not even be possible for the Azerbaijani people to live with the Armenian public again.  As a result, the people of Azerbaijan are shouting to the whole world; “We, as Azerbaijanis, have never looked at the language, religion, and skin color of the people and therefore did not think that Armenia would invade our lands. But once again, we were wrong.” There is a prevailing opinion that the trust of the Azerbaijani people in Armenia is exhausted, and it will never be possible to live with them. In particular, the women interviewed after the 44-day war showed harsh responses and refused the probability of the questions related to living together again.

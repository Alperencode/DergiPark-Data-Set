Makale Başlığı: A New Imitation Form of Late Roman D Hayes Form 7 Basins Uncovered at Andriake: Preliminary Evaluations on the ‘Andriake Form 7 Variant’
Özet: Andriake is located in the Demre District of Antalya. A port settlement in the ancient city of Myra, Andriake was established in the southwest of the city, in Çayağzı, where the stream Andriakos (Kokarçay) meets the sea. A new imitation of Hayes Form 7 basin uncovered in Andriake (Germanicus Square in 2010 and Wine Workshop in 2012) covers the subject of this study. This imitation form is named the Andriake Form 7 Variant. Here, we aim to give detailed information on the typological features of these basins, their clay and slip structures, clay contents, and dates. With the Andriake Form 7 Variant samples, belonging to the Late Roman D red slip wares group, a new subtype is added to Hayes Form 7 basin.

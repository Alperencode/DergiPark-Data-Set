Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Drying Processes on Model and Quantitative Color Quality Characteristics of Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.)
Özet: Drying is the process of removing the moisture in the product by evaporation up to a certain threshold value. The moisture content of the cauliflower vegetable is 90.76%, causing microbiological and enzymatic deterioration. For this reason, cauliflower should be preserved by drying in order to prolong its consumption life. In this study, drying process was carried out using different drying methods (oven, vacuum oven and convective dryer at 40, 50, 60 and 70ºC drying temperatures and in the shade). The effects of different drying temperatures applied to the cauliflower vegetable on the color properties and drying kinetics were investigated. It was determined that the lowest drying time was 3.75 hours with the convective drying method at 70ºC, and the greatest drying time was 275 hours with the shade drying method. In the mathematical modeling, Lewis, Wang Sing and Page equations were used. Among all drying models, the best drying data was found in the convective drying of the Page model equation at 70ºC and the oven drying method at 40ºC, R2 with value of 0.9998 in Wang and Singh model equation. In terms of color values, it has been determined that the method that best preserves fresh cauliflower is drying in the shade.

Makale Başlığı: Causes of Linguistic Errors in Hadith
Özet: The first concepts that come to our minds when we say language-based error in Hadiths are falsification, tashif and lahn. The problem expressed with these concepts is the mistakes that occur in the letters, movements and pronunciations of the words, and sometimes even in their meanings, mainly due to not knowing or misunderstanding the Arabic language. This problem, which has negative reflections in the provisions of fiqh over time, has always been one of the issues that those who deal with Islamic sciences, especially hadith, have always worked on and occupied their minds. In this study, after the brief definitions of the concepts of falsification, tashif and lahn, when the falsification started, what the reasons were and could be, and what stance Islamic scholars took in the face of this situation were examined. In addition, in order not to fall into the aforementioned mistake, the importance of the Arabic language and the sama, how it negatively affects the narrator and how it affects the provisions of fiqh has been tried to be explained. While examining these issues, it was tried to be explained by giving eleven examples for the error in the letter, movement and pronunciation of the word, and by giving five examples each for the error caused by the misunderstanding of the style.

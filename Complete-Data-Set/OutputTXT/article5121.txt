Makale Başlığı: Effects of Sowing Rate and Humic Acid Applications on Some Important Yield and Quality Parameters of Black Cumin (Nigella sativa L.)
Özet: This study was established in three replications according to the randomized blocks split plots experimental design in the summer growing season of 2019-2020. The sowing rate (1, 2 and 3 kg da-1) in the main plots and humic acid doses in the sub plots (Control, 100, 200 and 400 g da-1) were formed in this study. At the end of the study, parameters such as seed yield, biological yield, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, number of seeds per capsule, thousand seed weight, harvest index and crude oil ratio were investigated. At the end of the study, the plant height varied between 38.73-47.80 cm, the number of branches per plant varied between 2.50-3.85, the number of capsules per plant varied between 3.35-4.90, the number of seeds per capsule varied between 64.94-75.52, thousand seed weight varied between 2.36-2.54 g, biological yield varied between 110.42-203.47 kg da-1, seed yield varied between 36.15-50.78 kg da-1, harvest index varied between 24.51-37.16% and crude oil ratio varied between 34.02-39.84%. According to the results, it can be said that 2 kg/da sowing norm and 200 g da-1 humic acid application, where the highest value is obtained in terms of seed yield, are the most appropriate amounts in black cumin production for Kayseri province.

Makale Başlığı: The Problem of Determining Causality in Environmental Criminal Law and Solution Proposals
Özet: Modernism has caused phenomena such as technology, industry and globalization to enter our lives, and these concepts have brought issues such as environmental pollution to the agenda. The increase in economic activities has adversely affected the environment in a wide range, and an unending dialectic has begun between socio-economic development and environmental protection.Modern criminal law has not been indifferent to environmental pollution, and regulations have been drawn up at national/international levels on issues such as prevention of pollution and punishment of perpetrators when pollution occurs. In some complicated cases, the determination of the act, the result and the causal link between them has gained importance for the determination of the perpetrator who caused the injustice. It is difficult to determine the causal link in environmental pollution events, as there are situations such as cutting the causal link, leading causality, competing causality. In this study, studies on the determination of causality are brought together in the context of environmental criminal law, and causality problems are discussed, and it is aimed to contribute to the discussions in the doctrine.

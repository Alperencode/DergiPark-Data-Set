Makale Başlığı: Laboratory changes in older patients using SGLT2 inhibitors
Özet: Aim: In this study, we aimed to investigate the results of laboratory parameters related to the use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in individuals over 65 years of age who were using empagliflozin or dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Material and Method: A total of 140 patients over 65 years of age who had empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) added to their current treatment for T2DM were divided into two groups. Laboratory results at the beginning of treatment and at the 24th week of treatment and drug-related adverse events were noted. The study was retrospectively designed.Results: Significant decreases in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c were observed in both groups. There was a significant decrease in lipid parameters in the dapagliflozin group. Phosphorus values were elevated in the empagliflozin group. In both groups, there was a significant increase in hemoglobin and calcium values. There was no significant difference in terms of adverse events. Conclusion: We think that SGLT2 inhibitors, which have many positive effects other than blood sugar regulation with new mechanisms of action that continue to be discovered, can be administered as the primary treatment for appropriate patient groups.

Makale Başlığı: Cognitive, Emotional, Behavioral and Physiological Evaluation of the Relationship Between Brain and Gut Microbiota
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the effect of gut microbiota on brain functions, mood and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and behavioral addictions, neurotransmitter levels, cognitive processes such as self-control, decision making and delayed gratification. In this context, the relevant literature was reviewed and the findings were evaluated. The relationships of the bidirectional communication between the brain-gut axis with cognitive, emotional, behavioral and physiological processes were explained with a diagram. As a result, although more research is needed on this subject, it has been observed that the brain-gut axis is bidirectionally established through neural, stress, endocrine and immune systems. In this bidirectional communication process, there are interactions in the context of cognitive, emotional, behavioral and other physiological factors. These factors both individually enter into bidirectional relationships with the brain and gut microbiota and are affected by the bidirectional communication between the brain and gut.

Makale Başlığı: Mekki b. Ebî Talib and Ebû'l-Ferec Ibnu'l-Cevzî's view on nesh
Özet: In this article, we evaluated that it would be appropriate to understand the problem of naskh by comparing Makki b. Ebi Talib named al-İzâh li Nâsihi'l-Kur'an ve Mensuhihi and Ebû'l-Ferec İbnû'l-Cevzi's Nâsihi'l-Kur'ân ve Mensuhihi. Despite the geographical differences, it has been seen that Makki, who visited many science centers, had a view of the period he lived in, in agreement with the classical understanding. Nasih, which is one of the methods of resolving the conflict between verses or hadiths, is the common subject of tafsir, hadith and fiqh sciences. While explaining this subject, it is seen that the definitions and researches made on the basis of only one science will reveal incomplete results. Therefore, it is necessary to approach it holistically. The inclusion of the subjects that belong to the science of kalam or that express news in abrogation distracts the subject from its target. We think that the evaluation of the verses and hadiths included in the abrogation in terms of hadith method and interpretation will to some extent eliminate the comments and claims.

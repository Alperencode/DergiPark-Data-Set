Makale Başlığı: Angiotensinogen (AGT) gene screening and nutrigenetic approaches in patients diagnosed with hypertension
Özet: ABSTRACT Aim: Today, hypertension is one of the most important preventable risk factors for diseases with fatal consequences such as stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and end-stage renal failure, and it is estimated that there are approximately 15-16 million hypertension patients in Turkey. The aim of the study; to determine the nutritional habits of patients with clinically diagnosed hypertension and to investigate the nutrigenetic approaches of the disease. Method:For this purpose, the study is planned as two-stage. In the first stage, it was aimed to examine the nutritional habits by applying a questionnaire to the patients diagnosed with hypertension. In the second stage, it was aimed to reveal genetic changes by a screening of the Angiotensinogen gene  which is the disease-related gene in the clinically diagnosed patients..Results: In the result of the study; p.M268T change in Angiotensinogen gene was defined in one patient and this change was defined in the literature as rs699 /NCBI, which is known as one of the most important polymorphisms associated with hypertension. In addition, it was found that there was no change in nutritional patterns before and after diagnosis of hypertensive individuals and the rates of interviewing with dietitians were very low. Conclusion: The study is important as it is the first study conducted in terms of nutrigenetics in patients diagnosed with hypertension in the Turkish population.

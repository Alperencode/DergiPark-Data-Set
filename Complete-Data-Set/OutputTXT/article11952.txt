Makale Başlığı: Eyelid Masses Specifications and Prognostic Factors
Özet: In this study, we aimed to examine the epidemiological features, tumor types and incidence, localizations according to age and gender distribution, and the harmony between clinical and histopathological diagnoses in patients, who applied for eyelid tumor in our clinic. In the study, a total of 352 valvular tumors of 311 cases, who applied to the Department of Ophthalmology with a mass in the eyelid between 1995 and 2011were examined, treated and regularly checked in the Orbital Unit, were retrospectively evaluated from the medical records. One hundred and fifty patients of the investigated cases (48.24%) were male and 161 of them (51.76%) were female. The mean age on the onset of the symptomatic cases was 48.6±10.6 years. 78.97 percent of the masses were benign and 21.03 percent were malignant lesions. Epithelial tumors were the most common when tumors were analyzed based on which tissues led to the tumors. Besides, chalazion (28.40%) was the most common eyelid mass and the basal cell carcinoma (90.54%) was the most common malignant tumor. In the 90 percent of the benign eyelid tumors, the macroscopic diagnosis was compatible with the histopathological diagnosis. In the 77.5 percent of the malignant eyelid tumors, the macroscopic pre-diagnosis was compatible with the histopathological diagnosis. It is important to excise any lesions that cause suspicion in the eyelids at an early stage and make a histopathological diagnosis.

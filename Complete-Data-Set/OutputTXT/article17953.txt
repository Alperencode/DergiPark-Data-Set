Makale Başlığı: Trading Places: How Turkey Can Join the Rich, Using Trade Policy
Özet: The aim of Turkey’s 2023 Vision Project, whichcoincides with the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Republic ofTurkey, is to bring the Turkish economy into the ranks of high-incomecountries. To reach this goal, strategies have been drawn up with a focus onthe mid- and long-term future of the economy. However, the current state ofaffairs indicates that the Turkish economy has fallen into the middle incometrap, and the key to breaking free of that is reconfiguring a model of growththat focuses on production. In light of that situation, the aim of the study isto provide a discussion of the trade policies and strategies that could be usedto realize an effective model of economic growth.

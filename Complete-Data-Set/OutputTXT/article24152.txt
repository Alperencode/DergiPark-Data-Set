Makale Başlığı: Education and the Value of Humanity
Özet: In this article, the content and method and need for education is going to be discussed through the natural and ideal qualifications of man who has a distinctive position in the universe. It is to be elaborated the fact that the human beings which are similar to other living beings in terms of being alive is the only living creature with intelligence and therewith the need of education. By comparing the idealist approach, which considers man as a valuable asset, and the naturalist approach, which sees man as an intelligent animal and not attribute any value, it is revealed that neither in the past nor in the present, an identicalness can be established between animal and human. In the meantime, it will be indicated that this paradoxical situation of modern man, who are close to the naturalist world view that claims to have ideals, and who shows it in his practice. In this context, the contradictions of the human species, who complain about vanishing old values, claim that everything is corrupted, but still these species prioritize medium values over high values, is going to be discussed. To conclude, the argument here is that although ages change, human nature and values will never change, and that it is necessary to return to ideal human values such as loyalty, contentment, fidelity, and sacrifice for a better life and the World.

Özet: AbstractQualified children’s books are high-qualified learning materials constructed in accordance with children’s development levels. This study attempted to investigate the impacts of qualified children’s books on children’s skills such as explaining, comparing, interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, and inferring. To this end, a pretest–posttest model was employed in the present study with two groups each of which consisted of 25 students in 2015 spring semester. The Test on the Use of Cognitive Competencies, comprising 25 questions, was employed to determine the cognitive skills of the experimental and control group students. In the end, a posttest was administered to both the experimental and control groups. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, t-test, arithmetic mean, and standard deviation techniques. In light of the research findings, this study offers some suggestions for parents, teachers, and school administrators regarding the selection of quality children’s books. Key words: Cognitive function, inference, reading comprehension, reflective thinking

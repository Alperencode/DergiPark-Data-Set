Makale Başlığı: The Design of Wheat Warehouse: Ventilation System Design and Unit Price Analysis-II
Özet: Ventilation is a widely used method of preserving stored grain. This technology is used to change the microclimate of the product storage structure, to create unfavorable conditions for the development of harmful or harmful organisms in the grain, and to create favorable conditions for the constant preservation of grain quality. Considering the shortcomings of the existing warehouses, it is aimed to design the ventilation system and determine the approximate cost of a horizontal reinforced concrete warehouse with a storage capacity of 1500 tons for wheat grain in accordance with the technical data. As a result of the study, a total heat requirement of 73164.99 W was determined in order to ensure the optimum ambient temperature of the warehouse for safe and secure storage. The total cooling need is calculated as 105157.42 W. According to the unit prices of the designed wheat warehouse for 2022, the approximate cost of the Mechanical system (ventilation, air conditioning plant and automation) including VAT is 586052.90 ₺, the approximate cost of the electrical installation including VAT is 195145.39 ₺, the approximate cost of the construction elements including VAT is 2334272.79 ₺, and the total approximate cost including VAT is 3115471.08 ₺.

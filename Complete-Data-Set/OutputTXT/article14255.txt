Makale Başlığı: The Representation of Women in the Book of Dede Korkut and Beowulf
Özet: This article aims to analyse the female types in The Book of Dede Korkut and Beowulf, two important national epics that have survived today from the Middle Ages, comparatively. In both works, it is possible to encounter mothers who are praised for the heroism of their sons, and women mourning a loss. Such women are often portrayed as passive, and even their passivity is presented as a virtue in some cases. In addition to this type of woman, there are also strong and active female characters. These are warrior women who are able to ride horses and shoot arrows, and they have the skills to rescue male heroes in distress. Although both works have been analysed in terms of their treatment of gender and women, they have not been examined comparatively on these issues. In this context, this article comparatively examines the female characters of The Book of Dede Korkut and Beowulf by taking into account the geographies in which the works emerged, the conditions of the period, the effects of religions on gender roles, and the settled and nomadic orders of the mentioned societies.

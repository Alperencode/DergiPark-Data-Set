Makale Başlığı: DETERMİNATION OF SOME ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME LEVELS IN HAIRDRESSER EMPLOYESS IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICTS OF VAN PROVİNCE
Özet: Although hairdressing is not a dangerous profession, it is known that hairdressers are exposed to chemical combinations known as allergens, carcinogens or organic solvents. In this study, it was aimed to determine the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH), which are known as some important antioxidants, and malondialdehyde (MDA), the end product of lipid peroxidation and an indicator of oxidative stress, in hairdresser workers in Van. 33 female hairdresser employees working in the central districts of Van (Edremit, Tusba and Ipekyolu) were included in the scope of the study as subjects, and voluntary participants using hairdresser services were included as the control group. Venous blood was taken from those who accepted the study, examined in the laboratory, and the results were statistically analyzed. The difference between group means for MDA, CAT, SOD and GSH was statistically significant (p<0.05). As a result, it can be said that hairdressers, whose professional lives will last for many years, are in the potential risk group in the formation of diseases such as eczema, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, in which reactive oxygen derivatives also play a role, since they are constantly exposed to physical and chemical factors.

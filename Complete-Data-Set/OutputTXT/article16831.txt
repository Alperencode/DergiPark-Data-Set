Makale Başlığı: CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY WITH DIGITALIZATION IN CINEMA
Özet: With the developing digital technologies, pre-production, production, post-production, distribution and screening stages in cinema are changing and developing. This leads to changes in the position of the audience. Since the movies are watched collectively in movie theaters in the era of conventional production, the cinema experience is not individual but social. However, with digitalization, the audience started to watch the movies at home. Cinema is now moving towards an individual viewing culture rather than a social one. In the late 1970s, viewers had the opportunity to watch movies whenever and wherever they wanted via videotapes. However, there are problems with watching movies with some parts cut off due to the inaccessibility of every movie and the current controls. In the 1990s, thanks to the developing CD-Rom technologies, anyone who had a computer was able to have their own personal cinema. In the 2000s, with the developing internet technologies, the audience had the opportunity to access almost any movie they wanted. The desired movies can be accessed through computers, tablets and mobile phones, even during travel. In recent years, three-dimensional and interactive films have also met with the audience. Thus, viewers can intervene in digital films and re-edit them as they wish, thanks to the developing computer technologies.

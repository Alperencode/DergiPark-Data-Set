Makale Başlığı: US-Iran Relations: An Assessment On Iran's Role And Economic Sanctions
Özet: As a result of the acceleration of globalization, achieved by the coincidence of electronic communication systems with the theories of international relations since the beginning of the 21st century, we can state that the world political system has largely realized the phenomenon of globalization. Given these conditions, the strict definitions of "friend" or ''enemy'' in international relations have been replaced by a more moderate framework based on diplomatic studies. When analyzing the relations between two countries in today's world, one can find agreements and oppositions in the relations at the same time.In rare cases, however, there are relations between countries that cannot meet under any conditions and on any level, that can be called archaic hostility. This study focuses on the relationship between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran as an example. The purpose of this study is analysing US-Iran and Iran-Turkey relations for construing possible actions of US. In the study, in which the historical analysis method is used, Iran's limited trump cards and efforts to maintain its power in the region are also included in the study and it contains serious experiences for Turkey.

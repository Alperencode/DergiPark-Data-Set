Makale Başlığı: BATHYMETRIC ANALYSIS OF LYSTAD BAY, HORSESHOE ISLAND BY USING HIGH RESOLUTION MULTIBEAM ECHOSOUNDER DATA
Özet: In this study the compatibility between high resolution multibeam echosounder data of Lystad Bay, Horseshoe Island obtained during Turkish Antarctic Expedition-III and the soundings of British Admiralty (BA) 2974&3213 nautical charts produced by United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) was investigated. The bay was charted in 1960, first, by Lieut.C.J.C. Wynne-Edwards (Royal Navy)’s survey data and no chart has been produced with any new measurements since then. BA charts were created by means of single beam echosounder data. The comparison of the newly gathered data in the surveyed area (6.9km2) which covers half of the Lystad Bay indicate that soundings on the nautical charts of BA2974 & BA3213 are shallower and coastlines are not compatible. Additionally, the data from February 2019 depicts depths as varying between 2.8-94.6 meters. Dense multibeam echosounder data made 3D analyzes achievable, which shows that the sea bottom topography has not only trenches but also shoals that should be considered in order to navigate safely in the bay. Moreover, modern satellite-based positioning systems provide more accuracy than terrestrial positioning systems. The sound velocity is measured as 1446.5 and 1447.5 m/s at the surface and decreasing with increasing depth.

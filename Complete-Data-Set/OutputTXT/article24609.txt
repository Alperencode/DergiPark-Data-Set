Makale Başlığı: Integrated Teaching: Boon or a Bane?
Özet: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated teaching program using student feedback. A questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing teaching program was prepared and distributed among 185 second year medical undergraduate students who underwent integrated teaching in their first year. Their responses were recorded, evaluated and analysed statistically. Additionally the performance of the students was also assessed by recording their year-wise results in the university examinations. This was further compared with the results of the students who were not exposed to integrated teaching in the past years and the findings were tabulated. Integrated teaching was found to be an innovative method in strengthening the teaching-learning process and received wide acceptance from the student population

Makale Başlığı: Mass Modeling Based on The Physical Properties of Marfona and Hermes Potatoes With Different Shape Index
Özet: The aim of this study was to determine the mass modeling of Marfona, Hermes potato varieties with different shape indexes according to their geometric properties, projection areas, and volume properties. As different classifications in models for mass estimation; classification according to dimensions, 1st classification, 2nd classification according to projection area, and 3rd classification according to volume properties. For this purpose, the mass estimations were made according to geometric dimension characteristics as the length (l), width (w), thickness (t) dimensions, geometric mean diameter (Gmd), projected area characteristics as the first, second, and third projection areas (FPA, SPA, TPA), and criteria area (Cae), volume characteristics as the oblate spheroid (Vobsp) and ellipsoid spheroid (Vellsp) of Marfona and Hermes and mixed potato varieties with shape index. Potatoes were characterized as round (100-160) and oval (161-240) according to the shape index (SI). For mass estimation, a general total of 114 linear regression models were used in the analyzes, and models were proposed considering the maximum coefficient of determination (R2), minimum regression standard error (RSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) values. The model gave a maximum coefficient of determination (R2), minimum regression standard error (RSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) values among all models, without taking into account shape index, mass estimation with ellipsoid sphere volume for round (100-160) shape index as m=2.830 + 1.169Vellsp (R2=0.940, RSE=5.112, RMSE=5.035) in Hermes variety, and it can be recommended. Suggested models for mass estimation can be used in the design, project, and development of machines and systems for classification, cleaning, and sizing operations for post-harvest use of potato tubers.

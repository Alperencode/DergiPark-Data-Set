Makale Başlığı: Comparison of suicidal tendencies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a city in the western region of Turkey
Özet: Purpose: This study aims to compare the completed suicides in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic with the completed suicides in the same time interval immediately before the pandemic in the Manisa Province of Turkey and to investigate whether there are pandemic-specific completed suicide trends.Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of 162 completed suicides that occurred between January 2019 - February 2020 (pre-pandemic period) and March 2020 - June 2021 (pandemic period) in Manisa Province. Completed suicides were compared in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.Results: The number of completed suicides before and during the pandemic was 84 and 78, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods in the number of completed suicides. In terms of sociodemographic characteristics, marital status, contrary to gender, age, employment status, and educational level, caused a significant difference in the number of suicides before and during the pandemic period. Additionally, the season when the completed suicide occurred and the type of place of residence of the individuals with completed suicide, caused a significant difference in the number of suicides Conclusion: The study's findings indicated that the pandemic period was not a factor in general in completed suicides. Specifically, however, it is noteworthy that suicide by hanging was more common during the pandemic period, in the spring season, among individuals who were married, employed, resided in urban areas, had a low educational level, and had a history of psychiatric diseases such as mood disorders.

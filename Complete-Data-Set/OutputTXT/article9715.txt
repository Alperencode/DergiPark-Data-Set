Makale Başlığı: Simulation of Hydrogen Production from Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Applications through Aspen HYSYS
Özet: Hydrogen is an efficient, clean, and sustainable energy carrier with high energy density and zero emission, which can find important applications in fuel cells. Hydrolysis of ammonia borane is an enormous alternative to produce hydrogen. In this study, the hydrogen production via hydrolysis of ammonia borane for hydrogen fuel cell applications was investigated by using ASPEN HYSYS. Firstly, the thermodynamic method and suitable reactor were specified with depending on hydrogen production rate. The influences of reaction temperature and feed mass flow rate of water on the hydrogen production rate were studied. Hydrogen was acquired in the act of mixture with ammonia, boric acid, and unreacted water at the end of the reaction. First of all, solid boric acid was removed from the product mixture. Hydrogen would be purified from ammonia and water by using the separatory equipment. The goal of this study is to obtain the high production rate and high purity of hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell applications. The optimum operation parameters were determined as 30°C of reaction temperature and 0.1 of feed water concentration. 99.9% purity of hydrogen was obtained at 30°C.  The obtained results show that ASPEN HYSYS could be successfully applied for the determination of optimum reaction conditions and appropriate equipment for high production rate and purity hydrogen production from hydrolysis of ammonia borane.

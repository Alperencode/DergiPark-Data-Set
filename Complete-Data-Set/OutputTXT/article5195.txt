Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Turkey-Azerbaijan Alliance In The Second Karabakh War Within The Framework of Role Theory
Özet: During the Second Karabakh War between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a close cooperation was established between the Ankara and Baku administrations. The two independent countries showed diplomatic, political and military solidarity; and the equipment support provided by Turkey to Azerbaijan played a decisive role in the outcome of the war. The parade organized by Azerbaijan after the war was a declaration of the joint victory of the two countries. In this study, personal and national role conceptions, which are the factors that enable such close cooperation, are examined through qualitative content analysis of the statements made by the heads of state of the two countries during the Second Karabakh War. This study, which is carried out by making use of the role theory, argues that the personal and national role conceptions of the two leaders in their statements and their discourses about Armenia had a decisive influence on the cooperation policy followed by the two countries during the war.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of The Effects of Kids’ Athletics on Physical Fitness Parameters of 10-12 Age Group Children
Özet: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a 12-week training which included some games of Kids’ Athletics program on physical fitness parameters in children aged 10-12. 41 female and male students participated in the study voluntarily. Control group’s (n=20; 8 girls, 12 boys) mean age was 11.3 ± 0.47 years; the mean height was 145.58 ± 10,62 cm. The experimental group’s (n=21; 8 girls,-13 boys) mean age was 11.3 ± 0.47 years, the mean height was 142.44 ± 7.90 cm. In the study, Dordel-Koch Test was applied before and after the 12-week period. The training period was three months (12 weeks), three days a week, and 80 minutes a day. Athletics trainings were applied as a joint program in the experimental and control groups. However, Kids’ Athletics games in the experimental group were included in the unit training content. An ANOVA with mixed measures was applied using the SPSS (17.0) package program. The significance level was evaluated as p<0.05. Cohen d formulation was used to examine the effect sizes between the pretest and posttest scores. As a results of the mixed measures ANOVA, there were significant changes in the balance, standing long jump, sideways jump, 40 second push-up values within the group during the training period, while balance, flexibility, 40 second sit-up and push-up values improved between the groups.  In terms of effect size, flexibility, 40 second sit-up and push-up have a great effect between the groups. As a result; Kids’ Athletics have a great effect on flexibility, while balance on one leg, 40 seconds of sit-ups and push-ups are seen to have a moderate effect.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Loan Portfolio Concentration Level on Financial Stability and Performance: A Comparatıve Analysis in Dual Banking System
Özet: In this study, the effect of loan portfolio concentration on financial stabilityand performance was investigated in both conventional and Islamicbanking systems. In the study examining the period of 2005-Januaryand 2021-December, the long and short-term effects of credit portfolioconcentration on financial stability and performance in the bilateralbanking system were analyzed by cointegration tests. According to the empirical results, in which ARDL method for the conventional banking system and fully modified ordinary least squares(FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) methods for the Islamicbanking system were used, it has been found that the diversification of the loan portfolio reduces the bankruptcy risk inthe conventional banking system in the long run and it has both positive and negative lagged effects in the short run. Inthe Islamic banking system, while there is no relationship between this diversification and financial stability in the longrun, it has been concluded that it increases the risk of bankruptcy in the short run. When evaluated in terms of bankingperformance, it is seen that loan portfolio diversification does not cause a serious effect in the long or short term anddoes not cause differentiation within the bilateral banking system.Keywords: Credit risk, Loan portfolio concentration level, Financial performance, Financial stability, ARDL boundary test

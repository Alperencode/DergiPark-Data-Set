Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Important Food and Consumption Expenditures by Household Income Groups in Turkey
Özet: Purpose: The main purpose of the study is to calculate the general demand parameters and income elasticity of the households’ total consumption expenditures and expenditure group equation, considering the economic and demographic characteristics of the households. In addition, it is to show the socio-economic characteristics of the households, the amount and distribution of expenditures by income groups of 20%.Design/Methodology/Approach: The main material of this study is the household budget research micro data sets provided by the Turkish Statistical Institute for the years 2015-2016-2017. In the study, the data were sorted according to the annual disposable income of the households from small to large and divided into five equal 20% income groups. The socioeconomic characteristics of the households, the amount and share of expenditures are analysed in terms of these income groups. In the study, within the scope of the general data set, the total consumption expenditure model was analysed by the Double Logarithmic Function method and the expenditure group models were analysed by the Working-Leser Model method. In addition, the Heckman Two-Stage Demand Model was used in the study to avoid biased and inconsistent estimates due to zero-expenditure observations.Findings: In the study, all expenditure groups in all years were found to be positive sign and normal expenditure. In all years, “Transportation”, “Culture and Entertainment” (except 2017) and “Education” spending groups were found to be luxury or unit flexible spending. In addition, the lowest income elasticities in all years are “Housing and Rent, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels”, “Alcoholic Beverages, Cigarettes, Tobacco Products”, “Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages”; the highest income elasticities were calculated for the “Education” and “Transportation” expenditure groups.Originality/Value: Studies on consumption expenditures are closely related to decision units in the economy. The findings of the study may be useful for individuals and institutions interested in the subject.

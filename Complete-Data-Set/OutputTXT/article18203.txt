Makale Başlığı: POST-UNITARY FEDERALIZATION IN SOMALIA
Özet: Recent studies on federalism in Africa in comparative perspective suggest that African cases of federalism converge with the classical conceptions of federalism in terms of form and design, while diverging from those classical conceptions in terms of political regime, as well as eclectic innovations related to form and design. Federalism has not been popular at all in post-colonial Africa, where exists a small number of relatively recent examples, in which federalization of formerly unitary states is a process that is typically running within a larger conflict resolution process. This process is aimed at addressing ethnonational diversity and territorial integrity and which is driven by the relative powers of ethnonational groups and their political agendas. Hence, concepts like post-conflict federalism or holding-together federalism are conveniently applicable to these cases. This article will try to contribute to the developing body of comparative research on African federalism with a brief case study on the emerging federalism in post-conflict Somalia that has been rebuilt for more than two decades by the combined efforts of the Somalis and the international peace support.

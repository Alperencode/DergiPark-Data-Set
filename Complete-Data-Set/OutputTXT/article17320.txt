Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of Nigeria’s Biodiversity Governance: Policies, Institutions and Challenges
Özet: Nigeria's biodiversity richness is one of the most debated topics because of the dangers against it. Nigeria's oil spills are the most known problem regarding environmental policies. However, it is not the sole reason why Nigeria experiences biodiversity loss. It is a complex matter composed of conflictual needs, interests and desires of actors from state agencies, market stakeholders and civil society members. There is a necessity of investigating the governance aspect of Nigeria's biodiversity loss, which is not state-oriented work. There should be an orientation towards dynamics beyond regime effectiveness and regime interaction, because how civil society is positioned during the governance process cannot be ignored. This study investigates to what extent Nigeria has "good governance" of biodiversity conservation. It has been found that although the attempts have been unsuccessful, Nigerian governments are aware that governance approach is needed to solve biodiversity loss. However, lack of local authority and disconnection between civil society and governments prevent healthy working governance process.

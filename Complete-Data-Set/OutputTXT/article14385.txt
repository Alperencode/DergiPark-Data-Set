Makale Başlığı: Analysis of In-Plane Behaviour of Masonry Structures by Truss Model Approach
Özet: In masonry structures, determination of a structural behavior and load-bearing capacity becomes quite complicated when irregular wall bond patterns and the damages developing in load-bearing elements are considered, as well as the unclear in the material parameters. In these cases, preferring simplified approaches in a numerical analysis allows to obtain solution practically. In this study, in-plane damage developments and load-bearing capacities of masonry structure were tried to be determined using a numerical analysis model consisting of truss elements. In this method, which was proposed as an innovative approach in terms of use in masonry structures, frame elements that only load-bearing in the direction of the longitudinal axis were used. Thus, in the structure, it was aimed to obtain the maximum load-bearing capacity and damages that may occur, under external loads with the nonlinear analyzes performed by the equivalent calculation model. In the study based on masonry structures discussed in the literature previously, the advantages and disadvantages of the method were evaluated comparatively. Although the ductility response of a real structure couldn't be fully represented, it was observed that the maximum load-bearing capacity and damage formation zones could be determined with acceptable accuracy. Consequently, the equivalent truss model approach, which is proposed as an alternative to the commonly preferred detailed modeling procedures, is promising.

Makale Başlığı: A Research on the Perceived Risks by Generations in Online Shopping
Özet: This research was conducted to determine the differences between the types of perceived risks by the Baby Boomer Generation, X, Y, and Z generations, who are active consumers, in their internet shopping. To that end, a questionnaire form designed to examine the perceived risks by generations in internet shopping regarding time loss, psychological, financial, physical, product performance, and social risk types was randomly distributed to consumers in Karaman province, and data from 580 participants were collected. The collected data were analyzed with the help of Chi-Square, t-Test, One-way Analysis of Variance and Kruskal Wallis test. As a result of the analysis, the following types of risks were perceived by generations in Karaman in their internet shopping, from most to least: product performance (X̄=4,17), physical (X̄=3,60), financial (X̄=3,58), time loss (X̄=2,36), social (X̄=2,05) and psychological risk (X̄=1,83). According to the hypothesis testing, there is no significant difference between generations in terms of product performance, physical and financial risks. However, there were significant differences in terms of time loss, social and psychological risks.  In addition, the perceived risk levels of the X (X̄=2,86) and Y (X̄=2,87) generations were lower than the Baby Boomers (X̄=3,10) and the Z (X̄=3,11) generations, and there was a significant difference between the Y (X̄=2,87) generation and the Z (X̄=3,11) generation in terms of the perceived risk level.

Makale Başlığı: Investigating the Relationship Between Teachers' Perceptions of Instructional Supervision and Learning School
Özet: The purpose of this study is to research into the relationship between instructional supervision and learning school from the perspective of primary school teachers. This study utilized the correlational survey model, which is a type of quantitative research approach. The study's population includes 758 teachers working in primary schools associated with the MoNE in the central of Ağrı in 2021. The study's sample consisted of 257 teachers who were chosen using a simple random sampling method. As a data collection tool in research; "School Principals' Instructional Supervision Behavior (SPISB) Scale" and "Learning School (LS) Scale" were used. For statistical analysis of data; parametric tests were used. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the teachers' perceptions of learning schools were higher than their perceptions of instructional supervision. It was determined that teachers' perceptions of SPISB and LS differed significantly in some sub-dimensions according to their demographic variables. It was found that there is a significant positive relationship between the SPISB Scale sub-dimensions and the LS Scale sub-dimensions. The multiple regression analysis revealed that, with the exception of the personal mastery dimension, the sub-dimensions of the SPISB Scale significantly predicted the sub-dimensions of the LS Scale.

Makale Başlığı: AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY FEMALE MUSIC TEACHERS WORKING IN AFYON IN TERMS OF PROFESSIONAL VALUES
Özet: Today, women work in every field and constitute an important part of the productive population. A large number of female artists contribute to our music culture with their stage, education and musical productions in the field of music. Music education covers a wide area with professional, amateur and general music education dimensions. It is known that female music teachers, who take charge in all dimensions from pre-school to academic level, make very valuable contributions in this field. On the other hand, examining and arranging professional values and ethical concepts in every field where people are involved in production and consumption is of great importance in terms of carrying out the studies in a healthier way and improving the working conditions of the employees in the best way.In this study, the problems faced by female music teachers in the institutions they work at primary, secondary and high school levels were tried to be examined in terms of professional values. These problems were discussed under the headings of institution managers, colleagues, students, professional problems related to the practice of the profession, and the problems experienced by female music educators were tried to be examined by taking into account the values under these headings. The values that were ignored in the emergence of the problems experienced in the professional field in the research were created by considering the themes in the scale of "Developing the Professional Values Scale for Primary Education Teachers and Determining the Professional Values of Primary Education Teachers" developed by Nihal Tunca (2012). The values-oriented behaviors in Tunca's (2012) scale were adapted to the research and the problems that music teachers faced in their professional lives were tried to be determined according to these values. The research is important in terms of focusing on the problems of female music teachers and contributing to the determination of their problems.

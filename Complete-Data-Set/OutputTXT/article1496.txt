Makale Başlığı: AN ANALYSE OF SCHOOL BULLYING IN TERMS OF TURKISH PRIVATE LAW
Özet: Peer bullying, derived from psychology literature, has recently been adopted by not only Turkish doctrine, but also by the educational community and media. Even this term is used in daily conversations by the parents whose children are attending to primary or secondary schools. Peer bullying, accepted as a public health issue by the World Health Organisation, has recently been classified as cyber bullying and traditional bullying. However, this paper aims at only evaluating the legal consequences of the traditional bullying at schools (school bullying). Current studies related to the school bullying are based on the idea that peer violence among the students is preventable. Therefore, first of all the violence preventive strategies regarding school bullying are focused in the field of psychology and educational sciences. However, this paper determines that this issue could also be a violation of human rights and child rights. Also, when it is necessary, the protective and supportive measures should be taken by the judges for both bullies and victims. Finally, in case of peer bullying at schools, it is examined that who and why can be held liable in terms of Turkish private law. Eventually, not a great but a significant contribution to the existing literature is aimed by this paper.

Makale Başlığı: VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE TURKISH VERSION OF “DEBRIEFING EXPERIENCE SCALE” IN SIMULATION-BASED LEARNING
Özet: The most important phase of simulation-based learning is “debriefing”. The main purpose of a debriefing session is to have participants review their own performances and identify the attainments they achieved during the simulation. This study performed the validity and reliability test of the Turkish version of the “Debriefing Experience Scale”. The universe of the study consisted of students (N=303) from the Nursing Department of a university during the 2017–2018 academic year. Content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency reliability of the Debriefing Experience Scale were tested. The Cronbach’s alpha level of the scale was found to be 0.948 for “Experience with Debriefing” and 0.951 for “Importance of item”. The test-retest intraclass coefficient (ICC) was 0.999 (p<0.001). The Turkish version of the Debriefing Experience Scale is a valid and reliable scale and can be applied to students in Turkish Society.

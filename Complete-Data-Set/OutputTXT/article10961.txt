Makale Başlığı: Emotion as Sensation and Feeling in Maupassant’s La Peur
Özet: The  argumentation  process  is  not  exclusive  to  non-fictional  texts.  On  the  contrary,  it  has  coexisted  with  narrative  since  the  early  stages  of  human  history.  From  an  anthropological  point  of  view,  primitive  societies  imposed  social  prohibitions  and  laws through narrative discourses - such as myths - to avoid a possible crisis within society  and  to  ensure  homo  sapiens  survival.  In  considering  the  narrative  aspect  of  the  argument,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  assume  that  literary  discourse  can  constitute a certain argumentative reality. This article seeks to discover and verify the way  a  character  affects  its  extratextual  reader  through  the  argumentation  process.In  Guy  de  Maupassant’s  La  Peur,  a  group  of  soldiers  discuss  the  true  meaning  of  the  emotion  of  fear:  indeed,  they  argue  about  it.  The  ethos  constructed  by  the  storytelling  character  and  his  way  of  expressing  his  emotions  leads  us  to  discover  how fear’s literary expression can metamorphose into different states, like sensation and  feeling,  for  the  sake  of  making  the  storyteller  legitimate  in  his  discourse.  The  methodology  of  this  article  is  based  on  narrative,  enunciative  and  discursive  analyzes to identify the argumentative reality in Maupassant’s La Peur.

Makale Başlığı: A Modern Hatay (Antiocheia) Mosaic: “Ortak Varoluş” (Co-Existence) - I
Özet: Hatay Expo 2021, with the subject of “The Garden of Civilizations” on the basis of botany, is a project that is planned and carried out with multi-dimensional outputs in the fields of culture; art; tourism-economy and agriculture-ecology. In the fair area, right behind the “Main Entrance” on west, a 45 m diameter circular square that will welcome the visitors was designed and it was decided to decorate this area with mosaics. In order to make reference to the quality and richness of the mosaic art, which is one of the areas of interest of Hatay people from the past to the present, it was decided to realize this design, which reflects the old and modern basic values of the city, in this large area of 1600 m2. This mosaic design, which we call “co-existence”, combines the old and new styles in this area as an original work that includes ancient symbolism and is largely figure-based. For the first time in its field, the design reflects the geographic and cultural values of the region with a historical depth supported by scientific knowledge. By combining the symbolism of art with the figurative iconographic expression style in ancient mosaic art, it reveals a unique figural design with a holistic story based on scientific reality. In addition to the value created by the visual effect of design alone in terms of urban culture, the story of the city it hosts will be conveyed to the visitors by various means, and the people will gain memory at the level of consciousness.

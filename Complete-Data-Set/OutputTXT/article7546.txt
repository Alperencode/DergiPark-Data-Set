Makale Başlığı: The application of GIS in visualization of geotechnical data (SPT-Soil Properties): a case study in Eskisehir-Tepebaşı, Turkey
Özet: Recently, three-dimensional visualization of soil characteristics has been widely used in geotechnical engineering applications. In this study, the 3-D visualization of Tepebaşı area soils, the province of Eskişehir, is prepared using SPT data, soil classes through Environmental Visualization System-Mining Visualization System (EVS-MVS) programs. Moreover, the local soil conditions were classified according to the Turkish Earthquake Code 2018 and digitized using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and the data observed by the field and laboratory tests. The local soil conditions are observed utilizing the map classified according to the Turkish Earthquake Code 2018. By taking these 3D visuals and maps into consideration, it is determined that soil is alluvial. The ground water level is high, especially in the city center; the local soil type is ZD, ZE and ZF, according to the Turkish Earthquake Code (2018). Examination of the 3D visuals and maps reveal soil’s the changing soil profile with a gradual gradation from fine grain soil (clayey and silty) at the surface; to coarse grain soil (sandy and gravelly). Therefore, the 3D visuals and maps established in the scope of this study may provide preliminary information to the researchers and pragmatists in the area.

Makale Başlığı: Indecent Acts (TPC Art. No. 225)
Özet: The  crime  of  indecent  acts  is  regulated  in  Article  225  of  the  Turkish  Penal  Code  (TCPC)  No.  5237,  with  acts  involving  intentionally engaging in sexual intercourse and exhibitionism being covered by criminal sanctions in this same article. Besides  having  a  wide  application  area,  this  type  of  crime  also  involves  many  discussions  in  terms  of  crime  theory,  such as the legal value protected by this type of crime, how to make sense of the concepts of sexual intercourse and exhibitionism  in  the  legal  text,  whether  the  purpose  or  motive  of  the  perpetrator  has  an  effect  on  the  formation  of  the crime in terms of its moral element, and what the characteristics this type of crime has in terms of the application of the provisions of participation. Many issues require a holistic analysis within the framework of crime theory. In this context, examine the types of crime is thought to be useful within the framework of both German and Turkish teachings and  current  judicial  decisions.  Within  the  scope  of  the  study,  the  crime  of  indecent  acts  is  the  subject  of  analytical  examination within the framework of the examination method of the crime theory adopted by the new TPC.

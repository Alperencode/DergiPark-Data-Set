Özet: An online questionnaire, consisting of 24 questions was applied to determine individuals' food purchasing, food hygiene, and nutritional behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 658 respondents, 67% were female, 33% were male, 60% were 18-24 years old, and 25% were 25-31 years old. Supermarket shopping (73.9%) was the most preferred way to supply food, while the primary stocked up food was dried legumes (59.1%). The nutritional values and contents of foods were more paid attention to than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the packaged foods (79.3%) were primarily preferred. The most preferred methods for cleaning fresh fruits and vegetables were washing under running water (59.7%) and soaking in water with vinegar (43.2%). The participants intended to eat healthy foods during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the daily meal counts increased slightly. Food supplements, mainly vitamin C (73%) and vitamin D (40.5%) were consumed to strengthen the immune system. Additionally, social media (31.9%) and TV programs (20.3%) were very effective after medical doctor recommendations (32%) for orienting the nutritional behaviors of participants.

Özet: Purpose of the study; The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the pandemic process on occupational accidents that health personnel working in a state hospital are exposed to. During the pandemic process, 70 occupational accidents reported to the Provincial Directorate of Social Security regarding occupational accidents experienced by healthcare workers in a state hospital were examined retrospectively. In our study; It was determined that health personnel were exposed to cutting and knife injuries at a rate of 80%, contact with blood and body fluids at a rate of 2.85%, and musculoskeletal injuries at a rate of 14.28% during the pandemic process. It was determined that 24.28% of the health personnel who reported due to occupational accident had an occupational accident in the pandemic service and 12.86% in the vaccination polyclinics. It was determined that health workers were exposed to work accidents at a higher rate due to the increased workload and psychosocial risks with the pandemic process. In order to prevent occupational accidents and injuries, it is necessary to record which situations cause injury, to determine and plan preventive interventions.

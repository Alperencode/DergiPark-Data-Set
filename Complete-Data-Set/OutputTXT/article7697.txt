Makale Başlığı: Teleporting to the World of Online Shopping! Online Flow Experience and its Mediating Role between Virtual Store Atmosphere, Sales Promotions and Impulsive Buying
Özet: In this research, it is aimed to examine the relationships between virtual store atmosphere, sales promotions, flow experience, and impulsive purchasing within the framework of the S-O-R paradigm. Virtual store atmosphere and sales promotions are considered external stimuli, flow experience as an organism, and impulsive purchasing as a consumer reaction. The theoretical model was evaluated within the framework of the answers of 407 consumers accessed via an online survey. The results obtained revealed that there were statistically significant relationships between all variables discussed. Flow experience has a mediating role both between virtual store atmosphere-impulsive buying, and sales promotions-impulsive buying. It has been observed that in online shopping, consumers can experience flow with the effect of virtual store atmosphere and sales promotions, and this can result in impulsive buying. It is thought that these findings will contribute to the marketing literature and practice.

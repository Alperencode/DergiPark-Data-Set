Makale Başlığı: SERIAL PROCEDURE IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW
Özet: Alternative procedural methods can be used in order to complete criminal cases in a reasonable time and to reduce the workload of the courts. For this purpose, with the Law No. 7188, the Criminal Procedure Law No. 5271 was amended, and serial trial procedure was introduced in cases related to the crimes listed in Art.250. At the end of the ongoing investigation due to these crimes, if there is sufficient suspicion to file a criminal case against the suspect and a decision to postpone the opening of the criminal case is not made, the public prosecutor should offer the suspect to apply the serial procedure. In case the serial trial procedure is accepted by the suspect, the sanction will be determined by the public prosecutor, not by the criminal court. The implementation of the determined sanction will be requested from the Criminal Court of First Instance with a request form to be issued by the Public Prosecutor. If the court approves the request of the Public Prosecutor, a judgement is made without holding a hearing.

Makale Başlığı: THE STATUS OF THE CITY OF RAYY DURING THE APPEARANCE OF THE SELJUKIDS
Özet: Rayy, the important city of Central Iran, experienced a great transformation with the Islamic conquests. İt was dominated by the Arabs until the first half of the 9th century, and then Iranian dynasties took over the administration instead of the Abbasids. There was also such a period of disorder between the second half of the 9th century and the first half of the 10th century, when the Buwayhids seized power. Rayy became the capital of the Jibal branch of this state and preserved its stability until the beginning of the 11th century. Afterwards it went into the turbulent situation from this date until the domination of the Seljukids. On the other hand, as a result of the conquests from the beginning of the 11th century, it began to be ruled by the Turks. This period, which started with the Ghaznavids, caused another disturbance in the city due to the Turkmen trouble among the Ghaznavids. Political stability could only be restored with the efforts of the Seljukids, who emerged subsequent to the Ghaznavids. In this study, the situation of the city of Rayy during the emergence of the Seljukids was examined, and in this context, the end of the Buwayhid administration in Rayy and the period from the Ghaznavids to the domination of the Seljukids were discussed.

Makale Başlığı: Reflections of War Economy  Conditions on Urfa (1939-1945)
Özet: The Second World War, which started on September 1, 1939, adversely affected many countries, especially European countries, in terms of military, political, social and economic aspects. One of the countries that was significantly affected by the war is Turkey. During the war (1939-1945), Turkey was able to stay out of the war by following a policy of armed neutrality. However, in this process, Turkey lived under the conditions of war economy and faced various difficulties most of the time. As in other cities of Turkey, Urfa also faced the conditions of war economy and experienced the difficulties it brought. In this study, it is aimed to determine the effects of these practices by considering the reflections of the war economy and practices applied in Turkey during the Second World War on Urfa. As a result of the research, it was determined that increasing prices during the war, disruptions in consumption goods, profiteering events, bread card and wealth tax application were seen in Urfa and deeply affected the socio-economic life of the city.

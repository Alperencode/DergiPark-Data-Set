Makale Başlığı: Uncovering the Sociocultural Values Shaping Views and Policies on Disability in Turkey and the United States of America: A Comparative Analysis in the Context of Reasonable Accommodationtext of Reasonable Accommodation
Özet: The aims of this study are to explore the sociocultural values that shape views and policies on disability in Turkey and the United States of America (USA), to discuss how these values interact with other studies on disability in both communities, and to compare the studies in both countries in the context of reasonable accommodation. I conducted the study as a comparative case study research, a type of historical comparative research . I compared the sociocultural values that have shaped views and policies on disability throughout history using an interpretive approach over existing research and practices. As a result, sociocultural values together have shaped views and policies on disability in Turkey through the values of helping those in need and strong family ties as well as human rights and preventing discrimination in the harmonization process with the European Union and the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). On the other hand, the sociocultural values of individuality, independent living, opposing discrimination, and civil rights have shaped views and policies on disability in the USA. The concept of reasonable accommodation is aligned with all sociocultural values shaping views and policies on disability in the USA. The concept that entered Turkey through the UN CRPD is in tune with the sociocultural values of human rights and preventing discrimination.

Makale Başlığı: An Overview of the Late Neolithic Period of Southeastern Anatolia
Özet: The Early Neolithic period of southeastern Anatolia, a mountainous and hilly region of Upper Mesopotamia, had monumental limestone architecture. Because of a number of salvage operations conducted before the construction of dams on the Euphrates, the Tigris, and their tributaries, comprehensive information on the early habitation sites of the region is now being documented. Previously, almost all information on the Late Neolithic period of Upper Mesopotamia came from the Iraqi and Syrian territories, but in the last thirty years, much more information on this period of southeastern Anatolia has been collected. The Late Neolithic period in Mesopotamia covers the time span of circa 7000–5200 BCE. Animal husbandry was an important source of livelihood in this period, and true agrarian village settlements existed. In parallel with the considerable increase in milk and milk production, as well as with the widespread consumption of food cooked in liquids, making pottery from clay became a common production technique in the Late Neolithic. Formerly produced in small quantities to meet basic needs, pottery became an important craft by the middle of the period. Decorating the exteriors and interiors of vessels with painted decorations gradually became common and created an area of competition among the manufacturing workshops. The analogous pottery in a wide geographical area from the Mediterranean  Sea in the west to Lake Urmia in the east at the end of the Late Neolithic period indicates the existence of a seasonal mobile lifestyle.

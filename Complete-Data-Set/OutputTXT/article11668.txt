Makale Başlığı: The Prognostic Significance of Lactate Dehydrogenase Albumin Ratio in Elderly COVID-19 Patients
Özet: Objective: An acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus emerged in December 2019. This disease associated with the novel coronavirus quickly spread across the world, leading to significant fatalities. Reliable predictors of disease mortality and severity are therefore needed in order to decide on clinical follow-up or earlier clinical intervention. This study was performed around the hypothesis that the LDH/ALB ratio would yield more sensitive results in predicting the potential relationship between disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 aged over 65.Methods: COVID-19 patients aged over 65 presenting to a tertiary emergency department between August and October 2021, were investigated in this single-center, retrospective study. All patients over 65 presenting to the emergency department and diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. The study population was constituted following the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pulmonary involvement percentages and laboratory parameters were compared against patient mortality and thoracic tomography.Results: The relationship between patients’ lactate dehydrogenase/albumin ratios and mortality status was evaluated. The optimal cut-off value for the lactate dehydrogenase/albumin ratio in predicting mortality was 9.6 (AUC:0.815, sensitivity 75.9%, specificity 76.3%, p=0.001). The relationship between patients’ lactate dehydrogenase/albumin ratios and severity of pulmonary involvement was also examined. The cut-off value for severe pulmonary involvement was 11.2 (AUC:0.946, sensitivity 93.6%, specificity 87.4%, p=0.001).Conclusion: In conclusion, LDH/ALB ratio could be used to predict mortality and severity of pulmonary involvement in elderly COVID-19 patients.

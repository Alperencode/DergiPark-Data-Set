Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Levobupivacaine with Bupivacaine plus 25 µg fentanyl in Saddle Block Anesthesia for Daycase Plenoidal Sinus Surger
Özet: Our aim was to compare saddle anesthesia produced by 3 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine or 3mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine plus 25 µg fentanyl for daycase plenoidal sinus  surgery. In this study we evaluated hemodynamic effects, block levels, time to ambulation, time to get out the hospital and patient / surgeon satisfaction.ASA I-II, 60 patients were enrolled into the study. Patients were randomly allocated in two groups. Group B (n=30) 3 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine+25µg fentanyl, group L (n=30) 3 mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine+25µg fentanyl. The patients were applied standard monitoring, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Then spinal anesthesia was performed with using a 26 G atraumatic spinal needle at the L4-5 intervertebral space. Demographic and hemodynamic variables were not different between groups (p>0.05). Although in Group L,  time to reach L1-L2 dermatome  were significantly longer in group B were found. (P <0.05) According to the time of termination of sensory block in group B was statistically significantly longer in Group L were found. (P <0.05) Ambulation time and time to discharge were significantly longer in Group L than Group B (p<0.05) Side effects were not different between groups. We concluded that.short-term anorectal surgery  low doses bupivacaine and levobupivacaine can be safely applied without side effects.

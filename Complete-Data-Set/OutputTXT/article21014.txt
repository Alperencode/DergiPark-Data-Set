Makale Başlığı: ASSESSMENTS ON THE WORDS “SUCCEED” AND “SUCCESS”
Özet: In Turkish, which has a rich vocabulary, words are formed in various ways. Affixation is one of the most common ways of making words.  Borrowing is another way of making words, which has a wide range. Languages enrich their vocabulary by being influenced by each other and borrowing words. Therefore, Turkish has contributed to the enrichment of other languages by lending some words with its rich vocabulary. In our study, the information about both suffixes and origins of “succeed” and “success” lexemes createdd by affixation was compared with the opinions of the researchers, and data on the frequency of words were presented by revaling which languages these lexemes were borrowed from.

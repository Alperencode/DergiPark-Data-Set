Makale Başlığı: IMPLEMENTATION OF ISO 14001 IN LIME PRODUCTION FACILITIES
Özet: ISO 14001 Environmental Management System considers both nature and human health. While reducing the consumption of the source used in the lime production facility improves the formation of quality products. This study has been prepared on the measures to be taken to reduce the damage to the environment during lime production and its benefits to the environment, thanks to ISO 14001. The most significant damage in lime production facilities is the sulfur and nitrogen in the gas coming out of the chimneys. During the heating of the limestone and the formation of quicklime, most of the sulfur in the lime is not separated from the lime. However, since the heating process takes a short time in modern kiln systems, the harmful substance is separated from the limestone and mixes into the air. For this reason, the poison ratio of limestone decreases. Another critical issue is the damage to the environment during the extraction and transportation of limestone. In order to be able to implement ISO 14001 in the lime production facility, the risks are determined in advance, and their inspections are carried out, and then arrangements are made about the works that need to be controlled. These stages are based on the OHSAS 18001 standard, and an orderly and safe system is established.

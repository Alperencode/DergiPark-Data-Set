This research was carried out according to the qualitative research design. The data were obtained from the participants with semi-structured forms developed by the researchers and analyzed with the descriptive content analysis method. A total of 49 participants, 5 administrators and 44 teachers, working at the Housing Center Primary School (Camp/Temporary Accommodation Center) supported the research in the 2021-2022 academic year. In this study, the experiences of the administrators and teachers working at the school in the camp, where there are only refugee children in their schools and classrooms, the problems they encounter in the inclusive education process and their solutions were investigated. In the research findings, it was found that the administrators and teachers working in the education of immigrant children in temporary accommodation centers mostly experienced language-related problems, stated that the language difference was the basis of the problems experienced with immigrant students, that many of the teachers had not received any training for immigrant students within the scope of inclusive education, and that teachers and administrators It has been determined that they want to receive education, that the education should be directed not only to the teachers, but also to all the working personnel in the school, and that most of the teachers have the opinions of the teachers that immigrant students have equality of opportunity. The most important reason for this was determined as the fact that all of the students were Syrian and all of them lived in the camps. As a result of the research, it is suggested that serious and concrete steps should be taken towards the language/communication problems of immigrant children.

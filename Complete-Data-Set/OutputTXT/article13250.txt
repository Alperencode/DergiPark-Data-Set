Makale Başlığı: Common Attractive Point Theorems for a Finite Family of Multivalued Nonexpansive Mappings in Banach Spaces
Özet: OurmainpurposeofthispaperistointroducethemodifiedMannandIshikawaiteratesforfindingacommonattractivepoint of a finite family of multivalued nonexpansive mappings in the setting of uniformly convex Banach spaces. Weobtain necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee the strong convergence of the proposed algorithms withoutclosedness of the domain of such mappings. Moreover, we derive some consequences from our main result to fixedpoint result of such mappings. Finally, the numerical results are provided to support our main theorem.

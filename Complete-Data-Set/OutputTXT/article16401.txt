Özet: Providing corrective teacher feedback to English language learners is a significant and effective point for Turkish students. Many studies have been done to fix the importance of corrective teacher feedback. The overall aim of this study was to focus on the way that the instructors can change the students` point of view from teacher-corrective feedback to peer- feedback. Data gathered from this case study revealed that almost all of the instructors had positive view of peer-feedback and also had a high opinion of illuminating the path of students for giving peer-feedback.

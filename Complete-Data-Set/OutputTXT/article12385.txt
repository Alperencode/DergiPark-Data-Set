Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Analgesic Effectivity of Infra Orbital Nerve Block in Open Septorhinoplasty Surgery: A Retrospective Study
Özet: This retrospective study was conducted in order to demonstrate the clinical benefit of infraorbital regional anesthesia performed with intraoperative bupivacaine injection in postoperative pain scores during open septorhinoplasty operations. Postoperative 12-hour pain scores (Visual Analogue Scales) and data obtained from patient files of analgesic consumption of 60 (33 female; 27 male) participants aged 18-45 years who underwent open septorhinoplasty, ASA group I-II, were analyzed.d. The patients were divided into two groups; the control group (group C) included the participant who underwent open septorhinoplasty surgery and did not undergo intraoperative regional anesthesia. Patients who underwent open septorhinoplasty surgery and underwent regional anesthesia with 3 mL (15 mg) of bupivacaine hydrochloride in both infraorbital foramen intraoperatively were included in the bupivacaine group (group B). Patients in group B had lower pain scores at 1 hour postoperatively compared to group C. It was observed that the effective postoperative analgesia continued consistently at the 6th and 12th hours in the patients in group B. At the same time, the need for IV analgesics at the postoperative 12 hours was significantly lower in group B compared to group C. Intraoperative infraorbital regional bupivacaine anesthesia is an effective procedure that reduces postoperative pain levels in septorhinoplasty operations and increases the postoperative comfort of patients.

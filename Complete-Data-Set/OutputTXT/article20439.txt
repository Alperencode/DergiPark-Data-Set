Makale Başlığı: THE NEXUS BETWEEN EMBODIED TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION AND PRODUCTIVITY: KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION
Özet: This study examines embodied technology flows through intermediate good transactions between industriesin various economies and focuses on the ambiguity about their link to innovation. The model consistsof two equations measuring labor productivity and knowledge production, and knowledge productionis measured as the explanatory variable of productivity. We compare direct effect of embodied researchtransfer on labor productivity through intermediate good transactions between industries and its indirecteffect via knowledge creation. We use input-output tables as a proximity mechanism for research capitaland utilize production function approach. Simultaneous equations results support the system we introduce,indicating that both channels of embodied technology spillovers are significant. We observe that laborproductivity soars with direct and indirect utilization of technology transfer via knowledge production.

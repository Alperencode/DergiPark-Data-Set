Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Serum Carbonic Anhydrase Activity and Carbonic Anhydrase Autoantibody Levels in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis
Özet: An organism’s immune response to its own tissue antigens is called autoimmunity, and the diseases caused by such, autoimmune diseases. CA II (carbonic anhydrase II), the most common CA isoenzyme in humans, is considered a common target antigen, since it is abundantly synthesized in bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, renal tubular cells, and the epithelial cells of salivary glands, in addition to erythrocytes. Therefore, anti-CA measurements have become important in the diagnosis of some autoimmune diseases. The effect of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme in the measurement of CA I and CA II antibodies using ELISA was investigated using the serum of a group of rheumatoid arthritis patients.By this aim, total CA amount was found via determination of the amounts of CA I and CA II antibodies and of esterase activity by ELISA method. CA II autoantibody levels in the patient group of 0.255 ±¬ 0.182 (mean + SD), and 0.137 ± 0.040 in the control group were found (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, CA I autoantibody level was found to be 0.153 ± 0.036 in the patient group, and the control group level was 0.129 ± 0.052; (p = 0.965). There was no correlation between CA I/CA II autoantibody levels and serum CA activity. Thus, it was concluded that the determination of CA antibodies by ELISA method is not affected by CA activity in non-hemolytic serum.

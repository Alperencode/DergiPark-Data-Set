Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the relationships between burnout, family stress, family life satisfaction, family functionality, gender variable and age variable in parents of children with special needs, and also to determine the predictive level of gender variable, age variable, family stress, family life satisfaction and family functionality on the burnout score. For this purpose, “Maslach Burnout Scale”, “The Questionnaire on Resource and Stress-F”, “Family Life Satisfaction Scale” and “Systemic Family Functionality Scale” were applied to 184 family members of children with special needs in a special education and rehabilitation center in Bursa. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis and Multiple Hierarchical Regression Analysis techniques were used for the statistical analyses of the study. According to the findings of the study, there are significant relationships between burnout and family stress, family life satisfaction and family functionality. The results also showed that there was no significant relationship between burnout and gender and age variables. Significant predictors of burnout score were determined to be variables of family stress, family life satisfaction and family functionality, respectively. In the created model, it was seen that the predictor variables explained approximately 52% of the total variance regarding the burnout score. Accordingly, it was discussed by emphasizing the importance of concomitant variables determined as risk and protective factors in the guidance and psychological counseling services planned for the burnout that may occur in parents of children with special needs, and suggestions were made for studies.

Makale Başlığı: Coexistence of Migraine and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Özet: Aim: Migraine and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are two common health problems that have some common features and are frequently encountered in society. Is it possible for these two tables, which have so much in common, to coexist? If so, is this association meaningful? The study was designed in order to find answers to these questions.Method: This study was performed with a total of 345 subject as 178 patients having carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 167 migraine patients. The first group was composed of those diagnosed with CTS based on the nerve conduction measurements in the electrophysiology laboratory. These patients were classified according to the international headache classification criteria and those with and without migraine were determined in the light of the data in the questionnaire. The second group, called as migraine group, comprised of those admitted to the neurology outpatient clinic and diagnosed with migraine. The study was designed as a cross-sectional and comparative study.Results: Of the 345 patients who remained in the study after exclusion criteria, 178 were in the CTS group and 167 were in the migraine group. Although approximately 80,3% of those with CTS had migraine, only 12,6% of those diagnosed with migraine had CTS.Conclusion and Suggestions: We consider that migraine headaches may create a predisposition to contract CTS in the future. Additional studies are needed to support this view.

Makale Başlığı: A Reading on Symbolic Expression and Romantic Movement in the Postcards of the War of Independence
Özet: Postcards are communication tools that have increased in use in the world after the second half of the 19th century. It is also known that postcards printed with a wide variety of content were produced for propaganda purposes due to various political events and changes. The subject of this article is seven Liberation War Propaganda postcards, the reproductions of which are available in the Atatürk Library. In this article, it is aimed to analyze the symbolic expressions related to women, places and objects in connection with the written expressions on the postcards printed by Selahattin Ömer during the years of the National Struggle. Postcards with quotations from the works of Namık Kemal and Tevfik Fikret, who are known for their romantic poems on patriotism and nation in Turkish literature, aim to create national unity in the people. As a result of the analyzes made on the poetic expressions and drawings on the postcards, determinations such as the deep desperation, ecstatic attitudes, commemoration of the glorious victories of the past periods, nostalgia and melancholic mood in the female figure were determined as the data of the romantic style in the art of painting.

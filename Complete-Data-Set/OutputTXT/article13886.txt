Makale Başlığı: A Critical Approach to the Mythological Origins of Narcissism and Cynicism in an Interdisciplinary Context
Özet: The origins of narcissism and cynicism, which are becoming more and more popular concepts in the organizational behavior literature, are based on Ancient Greece in many studies. In this strength, the source of narcissism is associated with the myth of Narcissus, and the source of cynicism is associated with the philosophy of cynicism. Although the dominant references are in this direction, but it is possible to come across studies that argue that this situation consists of a wrong transmission. The fact that narcissism and cynicism are studied in different disciplines such as mythology, organizational behavior and psychology causes the discussions to be inconclusive. From this point of view, the aim of the research is; it includes expressing the reservations about the cultural structure of the concepts of narcissism and cynicism that have developed over the centuries and the possibility of wrong transmission of these concepts in terms of their compatibility with the contemporary world.

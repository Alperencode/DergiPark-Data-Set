Makale Başlığı: A CONTENT AND TECHNICAL ANALYSİS OF ZHUANGZI'S SATIRE
Özet: The Chinese thinker Zhuangzi (369-286 BC), who is an important representative of Taoist thought, conveys his philosophy through anecdotes and stories. He made important contributions to the literary literature of the period, as well as to the philosophical thought that developed in the "Pre-Qin" (before 221 BC). The most striking feature of the Zhuangzi’s texts, which also played an influential role in the development history of literature in China; are the technique of irony and the art of satire that come to the fore in his sentences and add originality to the stories. The thinker brought a new perspective to the traditional literary style of the period by presenting his views on society and life, his philosophy of life, social and political criticisms with satirical sentences and even serious propositions in a mocking style. In this study, the art of satire, which constitutes an important part of the literary success of the Zhuangzi texts and adds artistic appeal to the texts, will be evaluated in terms of both content and technique through sample anecdotes; it will be tried to introduce the critical Zhuangzi style, which contributes to the reading of the stories with interest even today by being transmitted throughout the ages.

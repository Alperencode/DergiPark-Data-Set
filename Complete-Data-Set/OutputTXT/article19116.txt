Makale Başlığı: Cynarin, Chlorogenic and Caffeic Acid Flavonoids, Cyanidin, Peonidin Anthocyanidins in Head, Heart, Bractes of Artichokes as Antioxidative Quality Indicators: Alterations By Boiling, Steaming and Frying
Özet: In edible parts- bracte leaves, heart, head of artichoke varieties (Turkish var.Sakız, var.Bayrampaşa), proximate composition, antioxidative major phenolic acids cyanarin-(1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid), chlorogenic acid-(5-O-caffeoylquinic acid), caffeic acid, anthocyanidins (cyanidin, peonidin), total phenolic acids-TPA, total flavonoids- TFlav, total phenolics-TP, total antocyanins were detemined (p0.01), the alterations on above-mentioned bioactive constituents through heat treatment effect (boiling, steaming, frying) were put forwarded. Cyanarin-(1,3-di-O- caffeoylquinic acid) was determined the major phenolic compound of head part of artichokes. It was determined about 6.2 ; 5.6; 3.48  fold  increasing  in TP content with boiling, steaming, frying, respectively respect to raw-form and total anthocyanins-TA  rised as 1.93 fold with boiling  whereas decreased as 1.04, 3.09 fold after steaming and frying, respectively. The important alterations were established  in phenolic acids -PA, total phenolics-TP, cyanarin, chlorogenic acids in boiling (B) > steaming (S) > frying (F) towards whereas 1.36; 1.28; 2.59 fold decreasing in TFlav with B,S,F processing, respectively (p<0.01).

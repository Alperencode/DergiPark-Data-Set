Makale Başlığı: Long-term compliance to continuous positive airway pressure therapy in patients with severe sleep apnea syndrome
Özet: Background and Aim: Compliance is the adherence of the patient to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy after his/her decision to start treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the compliance to CPAP therapy in a large patient population and the results were presented after 5 years of follow-up period in order to emphasize long-term compliance with CPAP treatment in the light of the literature.Materials and Methods: Patients who could not afford CPAP device or attend regular controls were excluded from the study and the remaining 174 patients were included in the study. At the end of 5 years, the patients were called back. A total of 110 patients met the eligibility criteria for the study110 patients (79 males, 31 females) whose charts were reviewed.Results: Fifty of 110 study participants (45.5%) regularly used CPAP device for ≥4 hours and the remaining 60 (54.5%) patients did not use CPAP device regularly. At the end of 5 years, we found that 36.4% of the patients used the device 4 hours a night. AHI severity does not affect adherence to the device and compliance rates (2=2.743; p=0.254).Conclusion: The patients compliance rates with CPAP device was found concord with the literature. This study conveys greater importance than other relevant studies in the literature in that it encompasses a larger patient population followed up for a longer period.

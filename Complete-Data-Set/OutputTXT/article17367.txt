Makale Başlığı: Are there any changes in serum renal parameters in patients undergoing ESWL therapy?
Özet: Purpose: The goal of this research was to explain the effects of ESWL on renal function (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy). Materials and Methods: This study was carried out retrospectively between November 2019 and October 2020, with 50 adult patients scheduled to perform an ESWL treatment because of a diagnosis of kidney stone and to completed the study protocol. In all of these patients, there was no urogenital abnormality, and none had a solitary kidney. Patients' mean age was 37.2 (between 26 and 67 years of age). Of patients, 31 (62%) were male and 19 (38%) were female. Three ESWL sessions were carried out in the patients and the time between sessions was set at 7 days. The routines collected one day before the ESWL (Routine I) protocol were repeated one day after the first session (Routine II) and one day after the end of all ESWL (Routine III) sessions.Results: There wasn’t any statistically significant difference among routines in terms of the ratio of serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, GFR and spot urine/protein. Conclusion: The findings indicate that the renal function tests do not need to assess whether ESWL leads to a tubular functional dysfunction in patients when treating upper urinary system stone disease.Keywords: Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), renal stone, renal function and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

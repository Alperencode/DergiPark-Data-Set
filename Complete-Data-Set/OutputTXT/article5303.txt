Özet: In this study, it is aimed to obtain a general result on the effect of the meşk system, which is the basic teaching method in Turkish Music, and the teacher-student interaction on the Mevlevi Ayin form. All composed Mevlevi Ayins constitute the universe of this research. The sample group consists of Zekai Dede's and Dede Efendi's Mevlevi Ayins. This study, which was structured according to qualitative research methods, was designed within the framework of a single case study, and data collection techniques were used with books, theses, journals, articles and similar sources in the context of forming the theoretical framework. For the study, Zekai Dede's Sûzidil, Mâye, Isfahan, Sûzinâk, and Sabâ-Zemzeme Mevlevi Ayins were compared with Dede Efendi's Şevkutarâb, Sabâ, Nevâ, Bestenigâr, Sabâbûselik, Hüzzâm, and Ferahfezâ Mevlevi Ayins in terms of makam and thus, similarities in Turkish Music were determined. The effect of teacher-student interaction on the composition of the Mevlevi Ayin was tried to be revealed.

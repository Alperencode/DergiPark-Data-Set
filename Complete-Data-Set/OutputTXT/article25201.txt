Makale Başlığı: Replacement of Vehicle Fleet with EVs Using PV Energy
Özet: The diffusion of electric vehicle, the reduction of environmental pollution and the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic system, wind farm, hydroelectric plants, bioenergy and geothermal plants are the principal aspects discussed in the world. For this reason, the goal of this work is to study for 2014 year in all Italy’s regions; the energy production obtained to photovoltaic systems and the possibility to use with different percentage this energy for recharge the electric vehicles. In particular, they have been considered different scenarios in function to the km travelled per year from the person. This paper examines the integration of green vehicle with the use of renewable sources in all regions of Italy in order to replace polluting vehicles circulating on the road.

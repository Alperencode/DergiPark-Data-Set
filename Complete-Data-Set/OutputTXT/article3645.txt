Makale Başlığı: Reliability and Validity Study of Adolescent Emotional Literacy Scale
Özet: The aim of this research is to develop an emotional literacy scale that can be used in secondary schools. For this purpose, data were collected from a total of 860 students in two different groups from different grade levels. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to test the construct validity of the scale. Then, confirmatory factor analysis was applied to the determined five-dimensional structure. To test the reliability of the scale, Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficients and test-retest reliability were checked. As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, a 28-item structure with 5 factors emerged. The variance explained by this five-factor structure is 50.378. In the second stage, the data obtained from 364 participants were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and it was found that the model fit values were good. While the internal consistency coefficient of the scale consisting of five factors was calculated as .90; the correlation coefficient was found to be .86 in the test-retest reliability measurements performed with a three-week interval.

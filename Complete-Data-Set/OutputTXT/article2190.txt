Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Heat Transfer Properties of Reinforced Rubber Composite Structures with Polyamide 6.6 Cord Fabric Used in Air Springs
Özet: This study presents experimental studies on thermal dissipation, thermal conductivity, and specific heat measurements of rubber mixtures reinforced with cord fabrics manufactured with three different PA 66 used in air suspension bellows. The studies were carried out between 20-160 °C. The cord fiber type and features used as reinforcement material within the rubber matrix significantly influence thermal properties. It has been observed that the amount of elastomer used in rubber composite mixtures also affects the thermal properties and approaches the properties of the matrix material. The thermal dissipation values of cord fabric reinforced rubber composites tend to decrease depending on the temperature. The heat flow perpendicular to the axis of the cord threads, the heat conduction rate is limited by the properties of the matrix, and the thermal properties of the composites approach the properties of this component. Because of the thermal properties of the progress perpendicular to the cord fiber of thermal resistance of cord fabrics, Increasing thermal conductivity and dissipation have been seen depending on the number of twists in a unit length for cord fiber. The thermal dissipation parallel to the fiber direction, the thermal dissipation perpendicular to the fiber direction and the thermal dissipation properties of the matrix were compared. As a result, it has been observed that the number of twists increases the thermal contact resistance by affecting the amount of compressed air in the composite samples and decreases the effective thermal conductivity perpendicular to the fiber array direction.

Makale Başlığı: The Importance and Development Process of Agro-Food Industry in Turkish Economy Abstract
Özet: Agri-food industries are among the most important sectors in Turkey due to their positive impact on gross national product, employment, production, added value and exports. Approximately 30% of agricultural products in Turkey are processed in agri-food industries and brought to consumers. In developed countries, this rate is 60%. Thus, most of the agricultural products produced in Turkey are brought to consumers without creating added value, that is, without being processed in agri-food industries. The data of the variables in the study include the 2005-2020 periods. The share of agri-food industries within the total industry is 6.38% in terms of the number of enterprises, 13.38% in terms of employment, 16.94% in terms of production value, 13.04% in terms of added value, and 29.08% in terms of export value. As can be understood from these indicators, agri-food industries are of great importance in the Turkish economy. In this study, the current situation of agri-food industries in Turkey was examined and its importance was revealed.

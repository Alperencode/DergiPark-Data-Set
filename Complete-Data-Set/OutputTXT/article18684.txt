Makale Başlığı: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Vaccination on Dental Restorative Practices in the Geriatric Population
Özet: Objective: Vaccines were considered as one of the most important public health measures during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare restorative dental practices of geriatric patients during pre-pandemic, pre-vaccination, and post-vaccination periods. Materials and Methods:  Dental records of patients aged older than 65 who presented to Bursa Oral and Dental Health Training and Research Hospital were included in the study. Restorative dental practices during the three periods: pre-pandemic period (01.01.2019−10.03.2020), pre-vaccination  period  (11.03.2020−13.02.2021)  and  post-vaccination  period  (14.02.2021−01.09.2021)  were  reviewed  according  to  the  patient’s  age  (young-old,  middle-old  and  old-old),  sex,  tooth  number  (anterior  and  posterior),  restoration  type  (occlusal,  proximal,  or  cervical) and the type of restoration material (amalgam or composite). Results: Anterior restorations accounted for more than half (53%) of all restorations in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period and 46.5% and 55.4% of restorations in the pre- and post-vaccination periods, respectively. The distribution of posterior amalgam restorations in the pre-pandemic period (31.5%) was higher than the pandemic period; in contrast, the composite restorations were higher during the pandemic pre-vaccination (73.9%) and post-vaccination (76.3%) periods (p<0.001). The males (odds ratio (OR): 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.34, p=0.02) and middle-old (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64-0.96, p=0.019) were more likely to use restorative dental services as compared to females and young-old age, respectively.Conclusion: Vaccination had a noticeable effect on increased admissions of geriatric patients and restorative dental treatments compared to  the  pre-vaccination  period.  In  addition,  in  the  post-COVID-19  vaccination  period,  composite  restorations  seem  to  have  replaced  amalgam restorations

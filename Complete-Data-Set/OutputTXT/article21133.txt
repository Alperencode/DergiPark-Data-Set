Makale Başlığı: The Millennial Generational Style: New Global Political and Economic Orientations
Özet: In this paper, using Mannheim, I identify Millennials (covering both Gen Y and  Gen  Z)  as  a  global  generation  that  has  spawned  a  new  generational  style.  I  provide  a  brief  overview  of  the  historical  conditions  that  have  shaped  Millennials’  life  experiences.  In  a  nutshell,  Millennials  have  come  of  age  in  a  new  world  marked  by  an  ongoing  shift  in  actorhood  from  macro  structures  to  micro  agents.  I  argue  that  this  formative  experience  has impelled at least three meaningful norms that distinguish Millennials’ generational style: self-reliance, quotidianism and regeneration. I then trace manifestations of these norms in politics and the economy. I suggest that in politics, the push for self-reliance takes the form of a self-responsible citizen, quotidianism is manifested through a shift towards politics of the ordinary, and regeneration is embodied in Do-it-Yourself (DIY) politics. In economics ,  on  the  other  hand,  the  self-reliant  actorhood  is  reflected  through  the  new occupational profile of the ‘maker’, quotidianism is expressed through non-traditional  types  of  work  monetizing  individuality  and  personality,  and finally regeneration takes the form of critical making. I conclude with implications  for  social  theory  on  youth  and  change.  The  paper  attempts  to  move  beyond  the  dichotomous  view  of  youth  either  as  threats  or  as  heroic  figures  and  propose  a  broader  conceptualization  of  young  adult’s  agency to capture how ordinary youth create new centers of configuration in society, from new citizenship norms to new market patterns.

Makale Başlığı: Relationship between childhood trauma, dyadic adjustment, and sexual functions in patients with bipolar disorder
Özet: Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the dyadic adjustment and sexual functions in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) during the remission period, and examine the effect of a history of childhood trauma on these.Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study is consisted of 80 (46 female, 34 male) patients with bipolar disorder-1 and 40 (25 female, 15 male) healthy controls. The Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), Arizona Sexual Questionnaire (ASEX) were administered to the participants.  Results: The patient group showed significantly higher trauma scores in all subscales and total scores of the CTQ-28, and lower scores in the subscales and total score of DAS compared to the control group. 82.5% of bipolar patients and 57.5% of healthy controls were found to have sexual dysfunction (SED). According to the results of linear regression and multiple regression analyses, age and DAS-total score predicted SED, and male gender, absence of SED and CTQ-total score predicted DAS score.Conclusion: Patients with BD have more dyadic problems, sexual dysfunction, and trauma history than healthy controls. Sexual function and dyadic adjustment affect each other in two ways and a history of childhood trauma has a negative effect on both sexual function and dyadic adjustment.

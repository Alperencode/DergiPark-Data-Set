Özet: This research aims to reveal the mediating role of work alienation in the effect of organizational cronyism on intention to leave. For this purpose, 300 sector/organization employees were included in the study. Data obtained from 300 individuals using quantitative methods were subjected to a series of regression analyzes using SPSS and AMOS programs. According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that there is a positive and significant relationship between organizational cronyism and the variables of alienation from work and intention to leave. Similarly, it was found that there was a positive and significant relationship between alienation from work and intention to leave. In addition, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses, and it was found that work alienation played a mediating role in the effect of organizational cronyism on turnover intention. From this point of view, it has been determined that as the attitude scores of the participants towards organizational cronyism increase, their scores on work alienation and intention to leave work also increase.

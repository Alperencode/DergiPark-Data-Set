Makale Başlığı: Celalis in an Ottoman Capital; Celali Invasion in Bursa and Its Destruction
Özet: In the 17th century, many changes and transformations were experienced in the world and in the Ottoman Empire, a great turmoil called the Celali Revolts emerged in Ottoman Anatolia, in which people from almost every class participated. Although they did not gather around a single goal, it can be thought that the desire of the participants to achieve better living conditions underlies at the heart of the Celali Revolts. In this direction, Bursa became an important negotiation element with the state for the Celali rebels who wanted to reach better positions. Politically, culturally and economically prominent Bursa was invaded in 1607 by the Celali, led by Kalenderoğlu Mehmed. During this time, Kalenderoğlu's envoys went to Istanbul and negotiated a new administrative rank for him. During the invasion, which lasted about two months, most of the eastern part of the city was destroyed. In this study, which was prepared in line with the information obtained from the Bursa Şer'iye registries, it was concluded that the destruction was larger contrary to the general belief. In addition, the destroyed structures were mapped and the traces of the Celali invasion in Bursa were tried to be traced.

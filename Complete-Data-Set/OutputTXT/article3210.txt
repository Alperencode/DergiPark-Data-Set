Makale Başlığı: The Reflections of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the USA Economy and Global Economic Challenges
Özet: The world has spent the 20th century mostly with wars and deep political crises. In the 21st century, problems have become more complex by adding new ones to existing problems. The last crisis, the effects of which are deeply felt all over the world, has already taken its place in world history as the Covid-19 pandemic. Although Covid-19 started with a health crisis, it soon evolved into a deep global economic crisis. During this period, all countries of the world have applied for a large number of financial support to minimize the economic turbulence caused by the pandemic.Within the scope of the fight against the pandemic, one of the countries that provide direct and indirect financial support to many people who have lost income within the framework of monetary and fiscal policies is the USA. The quarantine measures implemented and the deep uncertainty environment necessitated these financial practices. However macroeconomic indicators deteriorated in the period when the pandemic was felt most severely, and ultimately, public expenditures and budget deficits increased significantly. Considering the place and size of the USA in the global economy, the policies put forward by the USA in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic are more important for the global economy. In this context, in this study, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the USA economy were discussed and policy recommendations were made for the global economic problems caused by the pandemic.

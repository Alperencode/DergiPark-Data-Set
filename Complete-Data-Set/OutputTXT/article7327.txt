Makale Başlığı: Pre-Service Science Teachers’ Views on the Use of Indigenous Chemistry Knowledge in Chemistry Metacognition
Özet: This study focused on the views of pre-service science teachers on the use of indigenous chemistry knowledge in chemistry metacognition. A descriptive qualitative case study design using the interpretive paradigm was employed. The social constructivist theory guided the study as cognitive functions are dependent on social interactions with other individuals and the environment. Purposively sampled 29 pre-service science teachers were the respondents who had no previous tertiary chemistry education experience. Data was collected using focus group interviews, observation and document analysis. Constant comparison analysis was used for data analysis. The study shows that; (a) pre-service science teachers know and practice indigenous chemistry knowledge in agriculture, food preservation, food processing, health-care and environmental conservation. (b) Indigenous chemistry knowledge can be effectively used in chemistry metacognition when there is an awareness of chemistry concepts / ideas in indigenous chemistry knowledge. (c)  There is a positive attitude towards the use of indigenous chemistry knowledge in chemistry metacognition. The recommendation is that chemistry curriculum developers at teachers’ colleges must harness the multicultural indigenous chemistry knowledge from pre-service science teachers for establishment of a course in indigenous chemistry knowledge at the tertiary institutions.

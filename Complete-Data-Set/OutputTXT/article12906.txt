Makale Başlığı: The impact of obesity on the outcomes of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
Özet: Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of obesity on perioperative and functional outcomes in patients who underwent extraperitoneal LRP.Material and methods: After the approval of the ethics committee, the data of patients who underwent extraperitoneal LRP between April 2014 and June 2018 for localized prostate cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with follow-up period of less than 12 months, who were out of follow-up, who received preoperative hormonal therapy, who had a history of pelvic surgery or radiotherapy, and whose data were missing were excluded from the study. Demographic data, perioperative findings, pathology results and oncological and functional results in follow-up were recorded. Patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m² were included in the obese group.Results: A total of 160 patients were included in the study. There were 64 patients in the obese group and 96 patients in the non-obese group. The mean age of 64 patients in the obese group was 66.06±5.6, and the mean age of 96 patients in the non-obese group was 66.74±5.2. Preoperative IIEF scores were significantly lower in the obese patient group. Both groups had similar characteristics in terms of age, PSA, CCI, biopsy GS, clinical stage, intraoperative and postoperative complications. In addition, when the two groups were compared in terms of postoperative oncological outcomes, biochemical recurrence, continence, and decrease in IIEF scores, no significant difference was observed.Conclusions: LRP seemed safe and effective in obese patients, with similar onncological outcomes, functional outcomes, complication rates and continence rates to normal weight patients.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Morphological Characteristics of Tumbler Pigeons Reared in Kırıkkale Province
Özet: The aim of this research was to determine the morphological characteristics of Kırıkkale tumbler pigeons. For this purpose, morphological characteristics were determined in 80 pigeons from 7 different breeders in Kırıkkale province. The body weight (P<0.05), body length (P<0.001), wing length (P<0.05), head width (P<0.01), and beak depth (P<0.001) were significantly influenced by sex. Male pigeons had higher values than female pigeons for these traits. Age group affected body weight, chest width, and chest depth. Although age group II was higher than age group I in terms of body weight, the age group I was higher than age group II in terms of chest width and chest depth (P<0.05). As a result of the study, it was determined that most of Kırıkkale tumbler pigeons had brown-eyed (89.53 %) and small muff (78.48 %), and there was a high rate of individuals with gray plumage color (35.16 %) without a crest (45.35 %). Body weight, body length, wing length, thoracic perimeter, and head width values of Kırıkkale tumbler pigeons were lower than the study for Squadron flyer but higher than the Alabadem and Muradiye Dönek pigeons. Kırıkkale tumbler pigeons had similar values to Ankara tumbler pigeons in terms of morphological characteristics. It can be suggested that the genetic relationship level between Ankara pigeons and Kırıkkale pigeons should be clarified by genetic studies.

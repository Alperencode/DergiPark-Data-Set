Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Representation of Environmental News in National and Local Newspaper in the context of Alternative Media and Rights Journalism
Özet: Alternative media is one of the most important platforms for human rights journalism, since they are independent and democratic platforms where the marginalized in society can make their voices heard. Mainstream media, on the other hand, generally do not prefer human rights journalism because of their political and economic interests or because they are not concerned with the event that is subject of human rights violation. In this study, the general content of the environment news in the mainstream national and local press between 10 March and 31 May 2020, were evaluated in the context of human rights journalism. Quantitative data on the amount of news in these newspapers were also obtained. In addition, as alternative media platforms, the reports of Greenpeace Turkey, TURMEPA, ÇEKUD, ÇEVKO, ÇEKUD, ÇEKUL etc. and Denizhaber.com, Çevrehaber.com that is website about important developments regarding Environment rights and the media organs that include environmental associations between 10 March and 31 May 2020 were also examined.

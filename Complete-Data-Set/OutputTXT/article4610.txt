Makale Başlığı: Gender Fictıon and Narrative Strategies in Postmodern Tale: Rewrıtıngs of Little Red Riding Hood
Özet: Studying fairy tales and their rewriting without addressing gender issues causes studies to be incomplete. The masculine elements in fairy tales provide a wealth of material to be evaluated within the framework of feminist theory. In the narrative structure consisting of characters acting with a limited number of stereotyped behaviour patterns, stereotyped understandings of gender representations and sexual orientation differences are maintained and reproduced. In order to make this sexist attitude visible and transform it, the tales that were born in the folk culture and survived until today are rewritten by the authors. The narrative of "Little Red Riding Hood", a European folk tale, based on events between a little girl and a wolf; It is one of the leading tales that maintain a sexist attitude, have a worldwide reputation and are rewritten. In the study, three different rewriting of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale will be examined in terms of form and content in the perspective of postfeminist criticism, the differences and similarities between the first written version and the later derived forms will be revealed, and it will be discussed whether the three texts examined apply a deconstruction to the first text. The texts will be analysed considering whether these tales provide alternative positions for children.

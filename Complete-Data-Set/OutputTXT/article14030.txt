Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Temperature and Nutrient on Developmental Biology and Physiology of Stored-Product Species of Coleoptera
Özet: Insect pests of stored crops damage agricultural products in the fields or warehouses and cause crop loss. For this reason, it is of great importance to protect the products in warehouses after harvest. Many chemical control methods are being researched to prevent the damage they cause to the stored product. As the negative effects of these chemicals used in recent years on the environment and living things have been understood, different methods have been started to be developed. Because insects adapt to the environment very quickly, they develop more resistance to the chemicals used over time. For this reason, the biology and physiology of insects should be well known in the fight against insects. The better the biology and physiology of an insect are known, the more new methods can be developed in the integrated control methods of this insect. Insects are poikilothermic organisms. In other words, since they are organisms dependent on changes in environmental temperatures, temperature is very important in their development. Another factor affecting the biology and physiology of insects is nutrient. Temperature and food together can limit insect developmental stages. While high temperatures prolong the developmental stages, it can have the opposite effect in the adult period. Or insects feeding on poor quality nutrient can affect egg and adult size or cuticle development, as seen in some beetles. In this review study, the effects of temperature and nutrient on the biology and physiology of storage product pest Coleopters were evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: Visual Detection of Microplastics Derived from Plastic Mulch in Soil
Özet: This preliminary study aimed to visually investigate the presence and disturbance of microplastic particles among soil aggregate fractions (1000- 2000 µm - <0.053 μm) in a mulch applied soil. In the extraction of microplastics from the soil samples, two separate treatments were applied, by changing the order of applied solutions (NaCl-H2O2 and H2O2-NaCl), through density separation. In the first treatment, the soil sample was shaken first with a saturated NaCl solution, then filtered through the filter paper and the microplastics remaining on the filter paper were determined. Then, 30% H2O2 was added to the remaining soil sample. In the second treatment, H2O2 (30%) solution was applied first, and then saturated NaCl solution was added. Microplastics were counted and defined by stereo binocular microscope. In the first treatment 29 particles of 20g soil-1 and in the second treatment 16 particles of 20g soil-1 microplastics were found. Microplastics were found in all fractions and dominated form was “fiber” and in the form of 'round bead' were also found in the fraction smaller than 0.053 mm. As a result, in the extraction of microplastics, changing the order of application of solutions did not have a different effect on the extraction, showed that both treatments can be used for visual identification.

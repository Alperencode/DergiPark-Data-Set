Makale Başlığı: Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Sideritis lanata L. extracts
Özet: Sideritis L. (Lamiaceae) is represented by 45 species in Flora of Turkey. Sideritis lanata L. (Hairy ironwort) is located in the north-west, west, south-west and central Anatolia. Mountain tea (Sideritis plants) is used as a traditional remedy against common cold and gastrointestinal disorders. Its beneficial properties are attributed to its rich bioactive constituents. In this study, the antioxidant activities of the extracts of Sideritis lanata prepared using different solvents (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and 70% ethanol) from the aerial parts were determined by DPPH· scavenging effect assay. Also; determined of the antimicrobial activity of S. lanata extracts against 4 bacteria and 5 Candida species. Dried aerial parts of Sideritis were subjected to hydrodistillation and the oil obtained was analyzed by using GC and GC/MS. S. lanata extracts prepared with 70% ethanol was found to have a higher DPPH· scavenging activity (IC50= 0.241 mg/mL) than extracts prepared with other solvents. All extracts showed generally weak inhibitory effects (500-8000 μg/mL, MIC) against bacterial strains. Inhibitory doses against the tested Candida species were determined between 125-4000 μg/mL. The 70% ethanol extract of S. lanata inhibited Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750) (MIC: 125 μg/mL).

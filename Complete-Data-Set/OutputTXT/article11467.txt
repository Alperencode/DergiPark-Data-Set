Makale Başlığı: Use of PowerWorld Simulator in Learning Power Flow Analysis: A Computer-Aided Visualization Tool
Özet: The rapid development of renewable energy sources, the integration of distributed generation facilities, and advances in digitalization are causing a complex transformation in power systems around the world. The complexity of power systems makes power systems studies tedious, difficult and time-consuming for both undergraduate and graduate students. However, the use of simulation tools has greatly simplified the computational operations associated with power systems studies. Power flow studies are becoming increasingly necessary to evaluate not only the operation of the power system under current operating conditions but also the plan and design of future expansions. This paper provides a review of power flow analysis with PowerWorld Simulator, which uses advanced visualization techniques to assist students in better understanding complex phenomena in power systems. For this purpose, power flow analysis of Stevenson’s 5 bus power system was investigated by Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Seidel and Fast Decoupled methods. The simulation results are given both visually and as a table. As a result, it has been seen that with PowerWorld Simulator, students will better understand power system analysis problems in addition to traditional solutions.

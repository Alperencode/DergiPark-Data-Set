Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF THE SCHEMA-BASED METHOD EMBEDDED IN A SOCIAL STORY ON THE SKILLS OF SOLVING CHANGE PROBLEMS IN STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES
Özet: In this study, the effect of the schema-based change problem solving method embedded in the social story on the verbal mathematics change problem solving performance of the third grade students with learning disabilities was investigated. After communicating with the classroom teachers, three students with learning disabilities were selected and participated in the study. In the research, a special program was prepared for the teaching of verbal mathematics problems and presented in a social story. Before creating examples in both verbal mathematics and social stories in the program, detailed data were obtained from students and students' teachers about personal information and their choices about various topics. The research was carried out according to the multiple probe model between subjects, one of the single-subject experimental models. In the research findings, it was observed that the education process was effective and the correct responses of the students to the change problems continued after the end of the education. In addition, it was concluded that it caused them to generalize their verbal mathematics problem-solving skills to different environments.

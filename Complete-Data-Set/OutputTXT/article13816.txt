Makale Başlığı: THYROID SURGERY AND PERIOPERATIVE NURSING CARE
Özet: Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine system cancers with different biological and physical characteristics. There are 4 types of cancer: papillary, follicular, medullary and neoplastic. In thyroid cancer, tumors are usually removed surgically. The main purpose of thyroid surgery is to control the disease completely or permanently and to keep morbidity to a minimum. Surgical nurses play an important role in the pre-, intra- and post-operative care of patients. Nursing care applied before the surgery affects the patient results during and after the surgery. In the postoperative period, patients should be evaluated for postoperative bleeding, thyrotoxicosis, tetany, hypocalcemia, and recurrent nerve injury.

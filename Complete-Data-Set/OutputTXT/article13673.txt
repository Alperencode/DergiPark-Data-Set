Interactive infographics,one of these titles, are environments that provide the user with the opportunity to present more informationand at the same time provide them with control over the data, aiming to quickly understand the informationpresented to them. The design process is important in constructing the interaction in a healthy andunderstandable way, in terms of revealing a functional study according to the perception level of the targetaudience. Along with this process, the gestalt principles used in the creation of the design play an importantrole in creating an effective and efficient design environment where users can associate different elementsin the design environment with each other. In this study, first of all, gestalt perception principles and designdevelopment process in interaction design were emphasized and the interactive infographic applicationsdiscussed were evaluated in the light of these principles and interaction design process. It is aimed toreveal the importance of the design development process and gestalt perception principles in interactiveinfographics, at this point, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

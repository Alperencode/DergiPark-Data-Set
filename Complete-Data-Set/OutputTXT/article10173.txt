Makale Başlığı: LIBYA IN EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN ENERGY COMPETITION
Özet: With its significant amount of energy reserves, Eastern Mediterranean has become a geography that regional and global actors are interested in since the 2000s. Libya, which did not achieve the expected stability with the 2011 Arab Spring, overcame its fragility and became involved in the resource competition in the Mediterranean region in order to increase domestic stability and thus regain its influence in the international arena. Tripoli and Tobruk-based administrations, which stand out in Libya, where many different groups are in conflict, are trying to strengthen their position in the country through foreign support. Libya has become one of the important components of the energy competition in the region, especially when the Tripolibased Government of National Accord at that time, which was considered legitimate by the UN, signed an agreement with Turkey in 2019 to determine the Eastern Mediterranean maritime jurisdiction areas. Libya's involvement in the process has emerged as a factor that determines the political future of Libya, as well as significantly affecting the energy equation in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the study, the process of creating one of the important actors of Libya's Eastern Mediterranean energy resources, the effect of Libya's aforementioned policies on the energy competition in the region and their reflections on Libya are discussed. The aim of the research is to reveal Libya's Eastern Mediterranean energy policies and the possible effects of these policies on the country. The inclusion of Libya in the Eastern Mediterranean energy competition has deepened the competition in the Eastern Mediterranean. On the other hand, the Eastern Mediterranean policies of the Government of National Reconciliation directly affected the relations between both domestic actors and foreign powers in Libya, and naturally the political outlook of the country.

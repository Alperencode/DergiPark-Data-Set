Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Diaconi Studies in the Context of the Bible
Özet: Although the diaconi works, which cover all kinds of financial and spiritual aid activities of Christians and which are organized by the Protestant church, are inspired by Jesus, it has reached its current institutional structure by developing its service area and diversity within the framework of changing conditions and needs. The first examples of diaconic studies, which are essentially based on the Christian belief of "love", are based on the Old Testament. The diacony, which gained a different dimension with the practices of Jesus, became one of the central concepts of the New Testament. Of course, it is not possible to talk about an institutionalized diacony in the current sense at the time of Jesus. The practices in the time of the apostles after Jesus have been a great source of inspiration in laying the foundations of today's diacony. As a result of the disasters and the emerging needs, especially after the 18th century, the diaconi took on an institutional structure within the Protestant church.

Makale Başlığı: Detection of genetic identity for hybrid Populus x canadensis trees along the Seyhan River
Özet: Populus x canadensis hybrids play an important role for the commercial poplar cultivation with good growth performance and adaptability in the world. Hybrid clones introduced the different region of Turkey replaced the native stands of Populus nigra gradually. Along the Seyhan River there are many mature and young hybrid poplar trees despite of less number of P. nigra as a result of hybrid plantations growing near the river. To detect the genetic identity of hybrid trees, 17 microsatellite markers were studied. Out of ten hybrid trees, seven trees had the different genotype. From the results of current study it is seen that hybrid poplar species reproduce at larger distances from the plantation sites and colonize riparian habitat thereby competing for resources with the native P. nigra species and threaten the genetic diversity of the species with genetic pollution via intogression. From the field trip observation and obtained genetic results, conservation of the native P. nigra trees is an important requirements to prevent the reduction of effective population size and population density. Establishing more seed sources of black poplar over the river stretch could provide the establishment of mainly pure black poplar seedlings nearby the parental stands.

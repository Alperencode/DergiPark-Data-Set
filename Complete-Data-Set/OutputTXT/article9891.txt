Makale Başlığı: CHANGING CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS RELATED TO NUTRIENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC
Özet: In this study, it was revealed how we experience the pandemic in the context of consumption behaviors for health by acting on the idea that being healthy is surrounded by a number of cultural behavior patterns. In order to collect data, in-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face in Erzurum, Turkey, based on the behavior of "food consumption”. During the pandemic, some changes that individuals make in their nutritional behavior in order to be healthy have attracted attention. This situation, on the other hand, has created effects that increase "solidarity" at a time when individualization is rising. In addition, there have been behaviors such as stock making or postponing purchase. As a result, the pandemic increased individuals ' confidence in traditional phenomena, as well as their confidence in each other.

Özet: Background:In this study, it was planned to retrospectively determine the congenital deficiencies of the third molars in 1460 panoramic films of pediatric patients in the Erzincan region and to examine the distribution according to gender and location in the jaws.Methods:This retrospective study was conducted at Erzincan Binali Yıldırım University, Faculty of Dentistry from June 2018 - January 2020. 1460 patients(752 females and 708 males) between the ages of 10-14 were studied with panoramic radiograph to assess for agenesis of mandibular third molars. Statistical data were analyzed in SPSS 22 program. The Pearson chi-square test was performed for determining the prevalence of congenitally agenesis of the third molar teeth.Results:The prevalence of third molar teeth agenesis was 35.6 %. Total numbers of patients with single third molar missing were 222(15.5 %). The ratio of the prevalence of third molar agenesis for females(38 %) was higher than that for males(33 %). Significantly more third-molar teeth were found to be missing from the maxilla(57 %) than the mandible(43 %). 529 patients(54 %) had agenesis only on the right side and 469 patients(46 %) had agenesis only on the left. Conclusion:The agenesis of the third molars was investigated in pediatric patients living in Erzincan province and its prevalence was found 35.6 %. Congenital deficiency of the third molar teeth is more common in women, while it has been observed more in the maxilla than in the mandible. More comprehensive studies can be done by increasing the number of individuals examined.

Makale Başlığı: Epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 clusters in healthcare workers in a univercity hospital at the first period of the pandemic
Özet: Objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the clusters of healthcare workers diagnosed with COVID-19 in a university hospital in terms of epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics. Methods: Since the beginning of the pandemic, healthcare workers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and their contacts in our hospital are followed up and risk assessments are made by phone call. In this descriptive study, epidemiological data of clusters formed between March 20-September 10, 2020 at a university hospital were used. Cases, where 3 or more healthcare workers were diagnosed in the same unit in the same time period, were considered a cluster. In addition to descriptive features, transmission chains were created for each cluster. Attack rates were calculated with a (95%) confidence interval. Results: A total of 98 healthcare workers were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the dates evaluated in the study. There were 4 clusters, and a total of 19 cases in the clusters, 9 of which were male (47.4%), mean age is 35.6 (±6.96). There are a total of 171 people in contact with the cases in the clusters. Of these contacts, 14 people were diagnosed with COVID-19. In-hospital secondary attack rate was 8.19% (95% CI: 4.74-13.05). Conclusion: Although healthcare workers have a high-risk working environment, work-related or social contacts among themselves also increase this risk. Our study enabled the determination of the epidemiological characteristics of the clusters by periodically evaluating the data collected through regular surveillance, and contributed to taking measures to reduce the transmission.

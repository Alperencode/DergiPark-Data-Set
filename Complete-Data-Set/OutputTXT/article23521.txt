Özet: Depression is common during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. It is reported that the Covid-19 pandemic has further increased the prevalence of perinatal depression. Perinatal depression may affect the women’s self-care and quality of life, as well as the development of the fetus, children, and the mental health of partners. Midwives play an active role in the care of women and their families in the perinatal period. Providing education opportunities for midwives related to the care of women with low mood may help women to continue their daily routines, reschedule the tasks that they have postponed, realise the importance of taking time for themselves, and understand the critical importance of spending quality time with their family and friends for maintaining their mental and social health. Providing information to women who take antidepressants and planning a pregnancy or is pregnant or breastfeeding, is crucial for maintaining the wellbeing of women and their babies. This literature review aims to examine the recent approaches regarding the detection and management of perinatal depression and to help midwives in providing basic suggestions for women with perinatal low mood.

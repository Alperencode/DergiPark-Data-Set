Makale Başlığı: Where is Mecmaul-Bahreyn?
Özet: One of the Qur'anic terms we encounter in Turkish literature is "Mecmau'l-bahreyn". Since the term, “Mecmau’l-bahreyn” is based on a verse in Qur'an, there are long explanations in the tafsirs about it. There-fore, it is a subject Muslim poets cannot remain uninterested about. This term, which dictionaries explain as a place name meaning "the place where two seas meet", is used by Turkish poets and writers both literally and figuratively in poems and prose. The Qur'an speaks of an incident between Moses and "a man who was given mercy and wisdom". Since it is stated in the hadiths that the person Moses met is Khidr, our poets and writers who deal with this issue also accept that the person Moses met is Khidr. However, "Mecmau'l-bahreyn", which indicates the place where these two people met, is used in different meanings as literal and figurative. In this study, a new approach is presented to determine the location of the place called "Mecmau'l-bahreyn".

Makale Başlığı: Agro-morphological characterization of local bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)
Özet: Aims: This study aims to evaluate the performance of local bean genotypes collected from different provinces.Methods and Results: The experiments were carried out in 2019 and 2020, using 68 bean genotypes and 5 cultivars (Akın, Akman98, Göynük98, Önceler98 and Yunus90) according to the augmented design. It was observed that there were significant variations among bean cultivars and genotypes in terms of all the characteristics examined. According to the research results in 2019, differences observed as follows; days to emergence 10.15-37.15 days, days to flowering 35.60-71.20 days, days to pod setting 53.65-84.85 days, chlorophyll contents   25.21-43.86 SPAD, plant heights 22.49-73.60 cm, pod lengths 6.75-14.35 cm, seed per pod 1.95-5.85, grain yield per plant 11.79-57.35 g and the harvest index 24.36-66.34%. The results for the same characteristics in 2020 were as follows; days to emergence 10.75-33.95 days, days to flowering 31.80-84.60 days, days to pod setting 60.55-92.55 days, chlorophyll content 27.29-47.25 SPAD, plant height 30.01-173.9 cm, pod length 5.85-12.60 cm, seed per pod 2.56-6.86, grain yield per plant 5.58-68.34 g and the harvest index 13.11-71.46%.Conclusions: It was determined that ISP5, ISP13, ISP18, ISP19, ISP21, ISP22, ISP23, ISP31, ISP32, ISP34, ISP35, ISP72, ISP98, BUR14, BUR20, BUR21, ESK3, KON5, MAN1, DEN2, KON16 and KON17 local genotypes showed higher performance than control cultivars in terms of seed per pod, grain yield per plant and harvest index.Significance and Impact of the Study: It was concluded that there were promising local genotypes superior to the cultivars in all characteristics.

Makale Başlığı: Examination Of Attitudes and Opinions Towards Digital Advertising In Terms Of Generations A Descriptive Analysis
Özet: Today, advertising uses all channels in an integrated way to reach the consumer by incorporating digital opportunities as well as maintaining its influence in traditional methods and channels. In this study, the thoughts and attitudes of consumer generations towards digital advertising were investigated; By examining traditional to digital advertising through digital natives and immigrants, the results of the consumer dimension were revealed. Qualitative research design was used in the study. With the semi-structured interview form that provides flexibility to the researcher, the interviews were conducted with a total of 40 participants, 20 each from the digital native and digital immigrant categories. The obtained information was categorized and the study was completed with descriptive analysis. The study is important in order to reveal how digital natives and immigrants, who are the subject of the research, see and use digital advertising, and how digital advertisements, which are expected to become more common in the future, make a difference in reception between generations. The fact that a study conducted in Turkey on the axis of digital advertising and generations has not been found in the literature review shows that the study has original value.

Makale Başlığı: Space, Traumatic Memory and Literature: ‘Unutkan Ayna’ As A Historical Novel
Özet: This article analyzes how witnessing trauma and traumatic events relates to space and memory in Gürsel Korat’s Unutkan Ayna. In this analysis Maurice Halbwach’s formulation of collective memory and Paul Ricoeur’s and Giorgio Agamben’s notions and concepts of “the witness” and “witnessing” will be employed. Collective memory is a concept that emphasizes the shared experiences of communities, and being so it constructs the meaning frame for the people of those experiences. Change of space makes it visible that the construction of collective memory is a dynamic process. In the novel, the writer uses space for determining traumatic witnessing and for constructing a social context like the memory that extends and differentiates through various imaginations. Witnessing, similar to rituals that shape the memory space, gathers the traces of collective experience and hence makes past traumas managable. Since trauma is an experience that cannot be fully verbalized, chronologically situated in a cognitive system, or registered by the mind, traumatic losses in history cannot easily emerge from within collective silence and be transformed into literature. Korat positions narration in opposition to historiography as he erodes the historical frame made of contrasting dualities and the collective silence, and marks this as an initial step taken towards a humanist history writing.

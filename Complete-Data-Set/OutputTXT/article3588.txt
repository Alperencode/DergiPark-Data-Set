Makale Başlığı: FROM THE 19TH CENTURY TO THE BALKAN WARS EPIDEMICS IN MACEDONIA
Özet: Epidemics that have adversely affected societies for centuries have often caused serious deaths. The Ottoman Empire also got its share from this situation. In the period from the 19th century until the Balkan Wars, Macedonia at the Rumeli borders of the Ottoman Empire struggled with epidemics such as cholera, plague and smallpox. While the municipalities took some measures to prevent the spread of the diseases, they were often insufficient to provide the hygiene of the people. For this reason, there have been many periodic epidemics in the region. The aim of the study is to detect the epidemic diseases in Macedonia as much as possible and to make inferences regarding the epidemics. Ottoman archive documents, Turkish and foreign periodicals were used as the main source in study. In addition to these sources, medical and epidemic history books thesis and articles were examined in detail.

Makale Başlığı: Some Differential Inequalities for Boundary Value Problems of Fractional Integro-Differential Equations
Özet: We  consider fractional integro-differential equations with boundary conditions and prove some differential inequalities related to given problem with the aid of technique of upper and lower solutions. We require these theorems because they serve as the basis for improvement of monotone iterative technique to such type of  differential equations of boundary value problems.

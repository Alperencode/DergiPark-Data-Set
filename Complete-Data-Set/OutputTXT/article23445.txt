Makale Başlığı: Cecal Ligation and Puncture-Induced Sepsis Model in Rats
Özet: Sepsis is a worldwide health problem with a high mortality rate. It may result from various conditions, including trauma, surgery, and infection. Kidneys and lungs rank among the sepsis-induced injured organs. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is similar to clinical sepsis and is preferred to imitate clinical diverticulitis or appendicitis perforations. Here, we designed a CLP model as a prestudy for further protective agent studies against CLP-induced sepsis. We aimed to find biochemical and histological results compatible with previous experimental CLP models in the literature. We used 20 female Wistar Albino rats. We created two randomized groups, a sham group, and a CLP group (n=10). We measured interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-10 cytokine levels. We assessed myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) levels in renal and lung tissues. We also examined the tissue samples for histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Cytokine levels and oxidant parameters were increased, and antioxidant parameters decreased in the CLP group as an indicator of a strong immune response due to sepsis. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings supported the biochemical findings on behalf of sepsis. The results demonstrated a meaningful sepsis picture indicating a successful CLP model, which we may prefer to use in further CLP-induced sepsis models.

Makale Başlığı: Detection of alkanolamines in liquid cement grinding aids by HPLC coupled with evaporative light scattering detector
Özet: Triethanolamine (TEA), triisopropanolamine (TIPA), diethanol isopropanolamine (DEIPA) are necessary cement additives, and  knowing  their  contents  is  needed  for  quality  control  and  also  to  understand  final  properties  of  the  cement.  Whether  it  is  the  production  of  grinding  aids,  technical  research  and  development  or  application  research  all  involve  the  detection  of  grinding  aids. This  work  developed  a  simple  analytical  technique  for  the  simultaneous  analysis  of  these  alkanolamines  in  liquid  cement  grinding  aids using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD). HPLC was conducted by an XBridge C18 column (with dimensions 4.6 × 250 mm and 5 μm particles) using methanol and 0.1% trichloroacetic acid as mobile elution phases. The ELSD sprayer and drift tube temperatures were 60 ºC and 90 ºC, respectively. HPLC-ELSD developed in this work demonstrated 1) high sensitivity with limits of detection for the three analytes are 0.15, 0.54, 1.04 μg/mL; 2) good linearity with correlation coefficients equal to 0.997–0.999 over the tested concentration range; 3) excellent repeatability with intra- and interday coefficient of variation (CV) below 2.71% and 4, satisfactory accuracy with recovery in the 95.5%–100.8% range. This novel method is a powerful, time- and costeffective tool for alkanolamine analyses and quality control.

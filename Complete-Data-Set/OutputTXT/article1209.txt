Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Self-regulated Online Learning Skills on Academic Achievement
Özet: Self-regulated learning is an active process during which students attempt to monitor, control, and regulate their cognitive motivation and behavior according to their goals. Self-regulated learning skills are significant in online learning and with students’ academic success. However, studies reveal conflicting results. As such, this study aims to determine the level of university students’ self-regulated online learning skills and to investigate the effect of their self-regulated online learning skills on their academic achievement. The population consists of 1152 students studying at second, third and fourth grades of Kütahya Dumlupınar University Faculty of Education during the 2020-2021 academic year. The sample consists of 207 students selected by random sampling. Data were gathered using the 'Self-regulated Online Learning Scale (SOL-Q)'. The academic achievement was evaluated over the grade point averages in the Fall semester of 2020-2021 academic year. Statistical analysis revealed that the self-regulated online learning skills of the students were moderate; the averages of the male students were relatively lower than the females’. Self-regulated online learning skills were a significant predictor of academic success. Although these findings were supported by previous research in traditional learning environments, present results also caution that self-regulated online learning could yield different results from self-regulated traditional learning.

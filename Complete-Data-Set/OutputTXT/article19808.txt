Makale Başlığı: The Direct Impact of a Flight Simulation Training Device on Student Pilot’s Flight Training : A Survey
Özet: This survey analyzed data of student pilots who were trained in the flight simulation training device (FSTD) in our institute before their inflight trainings started. The data from the FSTD revealed three most frequent reasons for student pilot failure in the given tasks. Fails and retakes of FSTD training numbers indicate the most problematic areas that students should master prior to inflight training. For the survey, a questionnaire was given to eight flight instructors. It was found that, FSTD training advances students who are capable in checklist utilization and communication observed in their first five hours of inflight training. The resulting data shows that the use of the FSTD for flight training before student pilots’ inflight training starts is highly advantageous.

Makale Başlığı: Mandibular condyle and ramus angles in healthy individuals: a multidedector computed tomography study
Özet: Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of the mandibular condyle horizontal inclination angle and condyle-ramus angle among different age and gender groups in asymptomatic healthy individuals. Methods: This study was conducted including computerized tomography (CT) images of 100 patients aged between 18–90 years. Results: The mean horizontal angle was 22.37° on the right side, 23.32° on the left; the condyle-ramus angle was 97.40° on the right side, 98.39° on the left. Conclusion: Knowing mandibular condyle horizontal inclination angle and condyle-ramus angle would be useful for radiologist during CT evaluation of mandible after a surgery or trauma and for surgeons to plan their approaches properly during surgical interventions.

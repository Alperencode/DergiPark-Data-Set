Makale Başlığı: Assessment of the adoption of 3D printing technology for construction delivery: A case study of Lagos State, Nigeria
Özet: The innovations of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) encouraged the application of 3D printing technology to complement and subsequently replace the conventional construction method. This study assessed the awareness, application, drivers and barriers to the adoption of 3D printing technology for construction with a view to enhancing faster and sustainable construction process. Primary data were obtained with the use of structured questionnaires which were self-administered to medium and small-sized construction firms/contractors in Lagos State. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study established that the awareness and application levels of the technology are still very low. The findings showed that there exist statistically significant differences (0.039 ≤ p ≤ 0.017) in 6 drivers for the adoption of 3D printing technology, which is influenced by the client’s demand and desire. The study further established that inadequate power supply limits the adoption of 3D printing in the Nigerian construction industry. Implications are indicated by the findings on drivers and barriers of the technology which could help the construction industry in developing countries towards capability improvement for better adoption of 3D printing innovation and enhanced sustainable construction process.

Makale Başlığı: A Framework for Digital Methods and Techniques in the Study of the Sociology of Religion
Özet: Method is one of the most fundamental elements of a scientific research. In the discipline of sociology of religion, which is a part of the religious sciences under the umbrella of social science, method is one of the important indicators that show the academic competence of a research. As a result of the spread of digital culture and the integration of digital technologies into our daily life practices, social science studies now position digital environments as new fields. Thus, the methods and techniques used in academic research also gain new appearances with digital networks. This study, which focuses on identifying digital methods and techniques that can be used in sociology of religion research, aims to draw a framework for digital methods and techniques with a descriptive approach. In this context, first of all, the “digital method” will be discussed from a conceptual and theoretical point of view, then it will be emphasized how the methods used in the physical/offline field can be applied in online environments. In addition, the convenience of digital research methods and techniques for the researcher and their contribution to the quality of the study, as well as their handicaps and ethical dilemmas will be touched upon. The lack of a study directly related to digital research methods and techniques in the Turkish literature is the original aspect of this article. Therefore, it is expected that the article will serve as a guide for researchers in social science in general and sociology of religion in particular.

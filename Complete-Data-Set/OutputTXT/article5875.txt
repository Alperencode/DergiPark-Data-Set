Özet: In this study, new information on the history of Gelincik (Vasili) Village in the Iskele District of the TRNC was analyzed with the text-verbal tissue-context triple research model, which is the triple research model of the Historical Reconstruction Theory and Performance Theory, one of the folklore theories, as well as the descriptive scanning method. will be evaluated. We see an uninterrupted Turkish domination and presence until 1878 on the island of Cyprus, which was cheered up by the Turkish population with the conquest of the island. It is seen that the political, economic and historical events that took place on the Island of Cyprus since 1878 have caused changes in many issues, especially the demographic structures of the townships and villages. These changes and the extent of these changes are still being investigated by social scientists. As a result of the first scan we made on the Cyprus map of Kitchener dated 1883 and the results of the 1831 Ottoman Cyprus census, it was seen that Gelincik (Vasili) village, which is generally known as a Greek village, is actually a Turkish village. Based on both written and oral sources, the re-history of the village was established and the issues including the reason for the Turkish population leaving the village were analyzed within the cause and effect relationship.

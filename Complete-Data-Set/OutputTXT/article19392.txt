Makale Başlığı: A Review o f Criteria I n Rain Water Harvesting Management
Özet: Rainwater harvesting has gained renewed interest in the arid and semi-arid regions since the 1970s. It is important to consider how significant amounts of water can be harvest from a single catchment location. Papers selected address a wide range of rainwater harvesting problems, including the regionalization of nature curves. The rural population has limited income, a high susceptibility to climate change, conventional agricultural activities and adversely affected water shortages. Rain Water Harvest is an alternative cause to water shortages and groundwater depletion issues. The discovery of suitable rainwater harvesting sites is an essential move towards optimizing the amount of water harvesting and mitigating the ecological effect by using remote sensing and GIS techniques. In this article, the main requirements and parameters for selecting appropriate sites for rainwater harvesting have been extract from previous studies.

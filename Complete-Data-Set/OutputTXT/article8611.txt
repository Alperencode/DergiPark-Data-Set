Makale Başlığı: Psychometric Evaluation of the Factors for University Choice Scale in a Military Academy
Özet: Military service is seen as a sacred and respected profession in Turkish society. Many different factors play a role in the selection of this profession, and students choose military schools for various reasons. This study examines the reasons why students studying at military academies have chosen the military profession. The psychometric properties of the Factors for University Choice Scale were evaluated in this context over a sample from a military academy in Istanbul; and the scale’s validity and reliability analyses were conducted. The research was carried out with 740 cadets studying at a military academy. The scale consists of 39 items and has eight sub-dimensions. The validity of the scale was tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The obtained fit indices were determined to show sufficient fit between the model and the data. For similar scale validity, its relationship with the Career Decision Scale and Satisfaction with Life Scale was also examined, as these had previously been proven to be valid and reliable; a significant relationship was reported to exist with both scales. The reliability of the scale was examined by calculating Cronbach’s alpha of internal consistency. The obtained findings obtained determined the internal consistency of the overall scale to be .79 and of its sub-dimensions to vary between .62 and .91. All these findings show the Factors for University Choice Scale to be both a valid and reliable measurement tool in the sample from a military higher education institution. The research results are discussed in light of the literature.

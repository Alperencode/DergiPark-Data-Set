Makale Başlığı: RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIRD MOLARS IN CHILDREN AGED 5-15 IN TURKEY
Özet: Objective: In this study, it was aimed to determine the age of the onset of crown calcification of third molars in children aged 5-15 years in Turkey, and to evaluate the development status of third molars by age.Material and Methods: Panoramic radiographs of the first 1024 patients between the ages of 5 and 15 years were evaluated. The development (calcification) of third molars was classified according to the Demirjian method.Results: When the onset age of the stages for maxillary and mandibular third molars were compared, no statistically significant difference was found (p≥0.05). In addition, although no statistically significant difference was found between genders regarding the age of calcification onset of third molars, it was observed that teeth #28 and #48 developed in boys approximately one year before girls (p≥0.05). When the onset age of the stages for maxillary and mandibular third molars were compared, no statistically significant difference was found (p≥0.05). Concerning stage 5, in which the furcation zone of third molars begins to calcify, although not statistically significant, all the maxillary and mandibular third molars were seen earlier in girls than boys.Conclusion: It was found that the maxillary third molars on the right side developed earlier than mandibular third molars.

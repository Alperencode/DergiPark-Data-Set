Makale Başlığı: Spatial Analysis of Museum-Themed Mobile Games and Cultural Heritage Focused Approach
Özet: Digital space design, which manifests itself on many platforms, also appears in mobile games. In particular, games with a three-dimensional design can be played in a completely architectural environment, accompanied by certain scenarios. It is also possible to encounter cultural narratives in mobile games The problem of this research is that there is no standard quality of representations of cultural heritage in mobile games. This study, it is aimed to analyze the spaces in mobile games and to reveal the cultural narratives conveyed by the spaces. For this, 91 games found on the Google Play Store with the keywords "Museum" and "Müze" were examined. The games were brought together in the data collection table. Purposive sampling, which is one of the sampling methods, was used in the study. Cultural heritage-oriented space analyzes were made with the three games "Father and Son", "Past for Future" and "Beyond Our Lives", which were determined as samples.  Sample games have a spatial quality in themselves and can be adapted to architectural design processes. Game spaces analysis approaches in the literature were used to develop a cultural heritage-oriented perspective for mobile game spaces.

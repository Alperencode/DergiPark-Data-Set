Makale Başlığı: SHOWDOWN OF TURKEY WITH “CONSTITUTIONAL HARDBALL”
Özet: Political claims and practices that are in tension with constitutional conventions and constitutional interpretations which are not previously challenged, and often conceived as in direct breach of the convention or the constitution by the other parties are named as “constitutional hardball” in the USA.  Presidential system and the framework constitution exacerbates the problem by creating more opportunities for constitutional hardball. Constitutional hardball moves the political discourse to an adversarial tone. Interpretation of the pre-2008 article 96 of the 1982 Constitution by the opposition in way that created a deadlock on election process of the President and the early elections called by the executive without even a vote of no confidence are two examples of constitutional hardball in Turkey. In both examples interpretations that are in tension with the presumption that 1982 Constitution created a rationalized parliamentary system before 2017 amendments had been used.

Makale Başlığı: UNFAIR COMPETITION CRIMES REGARDED BY TURKISH COMMERCIAL LAW IN TERMS OF ITS EFFECTS ON PRIVATE LAW
Özet: Almost all types of unfair competition offenses are regulated with reference to provisions that are in the nature of private law rules, each of which is shown as an example of commercial behavior and practices contrary to the rule of good faith.

The form of interpretation brought by the principle of legality necessitates a narrower evaluation of the acts of unfair competition, which are specifically regulated in the law and also constitute a crime, in terms of criminal law. On the other hand, although there are special provisions regarding both civil and criminal liability due to unfair competition, there is no provision regulating the relationship between criminal proceedings and civil proceedings regarding unfair competition. In this study, general information about the crime of unfair competition is given, and then the lawsuits that can be filed due to unfair competition are examined.

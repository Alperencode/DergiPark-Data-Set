Makale Başlığı: DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITY INDEXES AND SELECTED LOCAL STATISTICS
Özet: Both local governments and businesses carry out various activities in order to increase the quality of life of cities. While local governments produce policies to increase the welfare of the people living in the city, businesses also contribute to this increase in welfare with their investments. The relationship between the index created by the companies operating in the cities and whose stocks are traded in Borsa Istanbul and the local statistics of the cities has been tried to be revealed with this study. Between 2016 and 2020, the relationship between the economic indicators related to the city taken from the TUIK database on an annual basis and the 12 city indexes included in the calculations as the city index was examined by panel regression. According to the first model in the study, the explanatory variables of the dependent variable of the city index were determined as local exports, housing sales and the number of enterprises. According to the results of the second model in the study, export, number of enterprises and net migration variables were determined as explanatory variables of the city's GDP dependent variable. According to the results of both models, it was concluded that local governments should concentrate on these activities in order to increase local statistics in order to increase regional development.

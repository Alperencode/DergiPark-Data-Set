Makale Başlığı: “House on the Moon”: Female Isolation and Sisterhood in Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle (1962)
Özet: This article analyzes Shirley Jackson’s last completed novel, We Have Always Lived in the Castle (1962), in the context of thegenre of the “Female Gothic,” a term coined by Ellen Moers in Literary Women (1976) to refer to literary works written by women inthe Gothic mode since the eighteenth century. Incorporating fear andhorror into the stories of alienated female characters in uncanny Gothicsettings, “Female Gothic” has articulated women’s struggles to moveoutside the constrictive domestic sphere and gender codes. The Gothicmotifs and symbols in Shirley Jackson’s novels blur the lines betweenthe self and the Gothic landscape/setting, the past and the present, andthe real and the fantastic, and can either bring about self-destruction orenable resistance to and subversion of socio-cultural limitations andundesirable outside realities. In Jackson’s last novel, the home as aGothic symbol has a paradoxical quality, since it appears both as asymbol of domestic confinement and imprisonment and as a sort ofrefuge (from socio-cultural violence), in which female characters, ashaunting “witches,” can disrupt patriarchy from within and establish anew order based on sisterhood.

Özet: Objectives: This study has been analytically and retrospectively carried out to define and develop a healthy model for caring the elderly people. Methods: The research was performed at Family Health Centres of Kastamonu Directorate of Public Health, Çankırı İsmail Özdemir Nursing Home and Karabük Yücel Nursing Home bounded to Provincial Directorate of Family and Social Policies and the sampling has been realised through 492 elderly people. The data was gathered through Elderly Identification Form, Healthy Life Style Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, Social Support Scale of Multiple Dimensions, Scale for Ways of Coping Inventory, and Daily Life Activities Scale. In the assessment of the data, Pearson Ki-Kare and Fisher Exact tests were used to compare the frequency, percentage and average rates and qualitative data. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the significant risk factors discovered in the Univariate /one way analyses. Results: The fındings are meaningful altogether, not one by one. Accordingly, the level of getting old in a healthy way in the elderly people who have a low level of geriatric depression is higher by OR=1.05 (1.04–1.12), in the elderly having a high level of coping with stress it is higher by OR=1.05 (1.02–1.08) , in the ones visiting the friends it is OR=1.94 (1.09–3.44), in those going for a walk regularly it is higher by OR=2.89 (1.36–6.11), and in the ones sleeping in certain hours of the day it is OR=3.29 (1.77–6.12). The elderly people having insufficient amount of income were defined to be at more risk of getting old unhealthily by 2.20 when compared to the ones with sufficient income whereas the ones not working are at a risk of getting old unhealthily by 4.31. Conclusion: At the end of the study, considering the results analysing relation between sociodemographic, physical, psychological and socio-cultural variances of elderly people and getting old in a healthy way, A Model of Healthy Aging Care has been developed appropriate for cultural structure of Turkish society.

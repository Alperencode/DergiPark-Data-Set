Makale Başlığı: Pre-School Religious Education In Turkey During The Change Process Of Religious Education Policies (Example Of Quran Courses For 4-6 Years)
Özet: Quran Courses for 4-6-year-olds aim to contribute to children's mental development by supporting their religious and moral development. From 1923 to 2014, when the Republic was founded, preschool religious education was not provided in Turkey. Since 2014, these courses, opened under the Directorate of Religious Affairs, have gained widespread popularity throughout the country. There seem to be difficulties opening ways to such a field of courses, such as a lack of qualified teachers, curriculums, and physical spaces. To address these issues, changes are being made to bring the curriculum up to date and upgrade and improve teacher qualifications; additionally, there are ongoing discussions about improving the quality of preschool religious education in tandem with the growing number of students following the general curriculum. By scanning studies on 4-6 Age Quran Courses, which have emerged as a new field in religious education in Turkey, this study aims to reveal the problems that arise in terms of how to establish such courses, the competence of the teachers, the appropriateness of their curriculum, and physical spaces. As a result of the research, it was seen that the teachers working in these schools had pedagogical deficiencies. There were shortcomings in the curriculum, and the text, activity books, and schools were structurally inadequate. In this context, proposals have been presented to increase the quality of these schools.

Makale Başlığı: Phylogeny and taxonomy of a novel species of Pseudocercospora from India
Özet: A new species of Pseudocercospora is described causing leaf spot disease on Crotalaria assamica from India. The identity of isolate was based on asexual morphs, cultural characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of partial nuclear ribosomal 28S large subunit and complete internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence data with high statistical support value. Morphologically this species has characters similar to allied species in genus Pseudocercospora but differs in having catenate and branched conidia. Phylogenetic analysis using LSU and ITS reveals it a new species of Pseudocercospora (Capnodiales, Mycosphaerellaceae).

Makale Başlığı: Between Two Coups: An Outline of the Turkish Foreign Ministry between 1960-1980
Özet: As the main institution conducting Türkiye’s foreign policy, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is an understudied institution, despite the vast literature that is found regarding the foreign policy of the Republic of Türkiye. Türkiye’s diplomatic history has predominantly been studied through the preferences of political elites and the influence of international conjunctures. This study scrutinizes the Turkish Foreign Ministry through its course between 1960-1980, a period when the Ministry encountered certain challenges that had previously not been witnessed. The Turkish diplomatic bureaucracy was preoccupied with the impacts this period was having on both the Ministry as an institution as well as on Turkish foreign policy; a transformation process was experienced as a result. This study aims to shed light in this regard upon the transformation of the Turkish Foreign Ministry and its capability to react to the challenges it faced using a comparative analysis of examples all over the world and diplomatic witnesses of the period.

Makale Başlığı: Plague: A Tragic Way to Empower the Artistic Imagination and to Deliver Hope
Özet: This  paper  examines  the  impacts  of  the  plagues  in  dramatic  literature  and  performance  art  beginning  with  ancient  Greek  Theatre  and  ending  in  Contemporary  Theatre.  It  addresses  the  traditional  application  of  the  metaphorical employment of the plagues and a shift towards the pronunciation of the space in Contemporary Theatre. This research exposes the existential concerns that threaten humanity, such as fascism, marginalization, and the catastrophic consequences of climate change. To clarify the main argument, the classical and modern texts, along with the opinions of legendary theater theoreticians, directors, and artists, are examined. These sources range from Sophocles’ Oedipus the King, Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year, Albert Camus’ The Plague, and Ann Bogart, to Robert Wilson. These existential concerns, along with possible artistic responses to the current problems of climate change and COVID-19, inspired them to start a discussion through more ecologically concerned theater practices.. Keywords: Plague, Margin

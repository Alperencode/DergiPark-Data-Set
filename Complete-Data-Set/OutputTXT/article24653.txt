Makale Başlığı: From Text to Space: A Geographical Reading of Samed Behrengi
Özet: Authors reflect the cultural codes of the societies they live in. When these cultural codes are decoded by the reader, it becomes easier to perceive the work in many aspects and make textual productions from the text. In this study, Iranian author Samed Behrengi’s 10 story books which have also been popular in Turkey have been analysed in terms of text-space. First of all, the concept of space in the story books has been reviewed with a general screening method and then it is examined in depth. Thus, it was revealed how the dimensions of the research will be shaped. In the study, information about the space is coded and read through the texts. In this context, the contribution of space to text and text formation is discussed. In order for the spatial reading to take place, the author needs to make good observations. In this respect, Samed Behrengi, who is the subject of the research, has also objectively reflected the spaces he uses in his books as a good observer, and these places are the elements that will provide the reader with a cultural dimension. In the end of the study, 23 private spaces (living space) and 180 public spaces have been identified. Consequently, it is seen that if the students/readers who read the author’s books are steered to geographical reading, their perception of space will be enriched.

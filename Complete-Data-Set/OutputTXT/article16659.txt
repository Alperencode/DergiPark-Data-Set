Makale Başlığı: IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL ON ECONOMIC GROWTH: A META-ANALYSIS / Sosyal Sermayenin Ekonomik Büyüme Üzerindeki Etkisi: Bir Meta-Analiz
Özet: The aim of this study is to synthesize the studies on the effect of social capital on economic and financial growth with the method of meta-analysis. Social capital has an impact on economic development by influencing individuals, businesses, banks and the way they do business, and thus trade. In this study, the studies carried out in the years 2007-2021 are discussed. In order to be able to interpret the quantitative findings of the studies that have dealt with this subject together, studies made on academic databases were scanned, and the findings consisting of 36 studies meeting the determined criteria and having a total of 3458 observations were synthesized through the meta-analysis method. Research findings of 36 different studies including sample size, standard error, and effect values were analyzed with the help of CMA (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis) program. As a result of the meta-analysis, the effect size was found to be moderate (Fisher Z=0.380). According to the results of the meta-analysis, the H1 was accepted and it was revealed that the social capital level of the countries affected the economic growth at a moderate level. Considering the lack of consensus in the studies in the literature and the difficulty of measuring social capital, it is thought that this general finding is very valuable in terms of the literature and will make an important contribution.

Makale Başlığı: Role of Microbiota in Thyroid Diseases
Özet: The intestinal microbiota is essential for the host to ensure digestive and immunologic homeostasis. When microbiota homeostasis is impaired and dysbiosis occurs, the malfunction of epithelial barrier leads to intestinal and systemic disorders, chiefly immunologic and metabolic. The role of the intestinal tract is crucial in the metabolism of nutrients, drugs, and hormones, including exogenous and endogenous iodothyronines as well as micronutrients involved in thyroid homeostasis. In the studies, intestinal dysbiosis was detected mostly in autoimmune thyroid diseases and thyroid carcinoma. In addition, a correlation was observed between bacterial diversity and plasma thyroid parameters and bacterial diversity in thyroid diseases. However, the link between thyroid homeostasis and microbiota composition has not yet been clarified. When treating patients suffering from thyroid diseases, it is seen that there is a need for relevant clinical studies on making the probiotic supplement to be recommended in accordance with the intestinal composition.

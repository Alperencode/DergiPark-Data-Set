Makale Başlığı: تحويل آيا صوفيا من جديد إلى جامع
Özet: This study discusses the reconversion of Hagia Sophia into The Great Mosque of Ayasofia, 86 Years after its declaration as a museum. It provides a glimpse into the history of Hagia Sophia until the arrival of the Justice and Development Party  AKP . It also argues that Turkey managed to reinforce its sovereignty through that decision, of reconversion, as Ayasofia mosque is an important sovereign indicator of Turkey, as well as being the symbol of the conquest of Istanbul. The controversy surrounding Ayasofia in this context, both inside and outside of Turkey, formed the psychological basis for the normalization of relations between religion and state, and at the same time became a factor that strengthened Turkey's sovereignty

Makale Başlığı: Placement and sizing strategies for dynamic wireless charging stations on signalized intersection corridors
Özet: Dynamic wireless charging stations are a potential solution to the range problem of the limited battery capacity of electric vehicles. However, the infrastructure of these stations is costly, so it is important to position the wireless charging tracks (WCT) of the stations. This study proposes strategies in two different groups for positioning and sizing the charging stations on signalized corridors. The first group consists of two predefined strategies, while the second includes strategies using Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The performance of these strategies was tested taking into account various BEV ratios (𝑟𝐸𝑉) and maximum WCT lengths. Analysis results showed GWO and WOA is presented high-efficiency placement plans in the majority of cases studied. Surprisingly, however, with increasing 𝑟𝐸𝑉, the predefined strategies showed better performances in some cases than that of GWO and WOA. Another notable finding is that the efficiency of the station can be increased by using more WCTs at the corridor entrances. This study presents results that have the potential to contribute to the solution of the problem of positioning and sizing wireless charging stations for intersection corridors and were not highlighted in previous studies.

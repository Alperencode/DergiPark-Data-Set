Özet: Purpose: To examine the relationship between pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function, prolapse symptoms and sexual function in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP).Methods: Twenty-two women with POP (age=42.77±6.25 years, body mass index=26.72±4.37 kg/m2) were included in the study. The physical, demographic, and medical characteristics were recorded. PFM strength and endurance with perineometer device, POP staging with simplified POP- Quantification System, prolapse symptoms with Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS), sexual function with Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12) were evaluated. Spearman correlation test was used for statistical analysis.Results: In women with POP, it was found that there was a moderate negative correlation between the PFM strength and the POP-SS (p=0.027; rho=-0.470) and a moderate positive correlation between the PFM endurance and the PISQ-12 scores (p=0.035; rho=0.452). No significant correlation was determined between the PFM strength and the PISQ-12 score (p=0.382; rho=0.196), and between the PFM endurance and the POP-SS (p=0.399; rho=-0.189).Conclusion: In this study, it was detected a negative relationship between the PFM strength and prolapse symptom severity, and a positive relationship between the PFM endurance and sexual function in women with POP. In clinical settings, it may be important to consider the relationship between PFM functions and prolapse symptom severity and sexual function in women with POP.

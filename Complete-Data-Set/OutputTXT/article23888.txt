Makale Başlığı: EXAMINATION OF NURSES’ COVID-19 PHOBIA AND THANATOPHOBIA LEVELS AS PER THE SERVICE UNIT TYPE
Özet: Aims: This study aims to compare the levels of thanatophobia and COVID-19 phobia experienced by the nurses working for adult and pediatric services. Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses had to watch the deaths of countless patients. COVID-19 phobia has developed in nurses, as a risky group that follows the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic from the front. All of these may have triggered nurses' fears of death.Method: In the study designed as a descriptive research, the data were collected online. A total of 476 nurses were included in the study. The data of the study were collected by using Socio-demographic Information Form, COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S), and Thanatophobia Scale (TS)Results: It was found that the mean of nurses’ C19P-S scores was 63.6±23 points and the mean of their TS scores was 5.22±1.57 points. It was identified that the nurses working for adult services obtained higher mean scores from the C19P-S and TS than those working for pediatric services. A positive correlation was found between the C19P-S sub-dimensions and TS. The higher the C19P-S score, the higher the nurses' fear of death scores (r=0.147, p=0.032).Conclusion: In conclusion, the nurses working at both adult and pediatric services had medium-level COVID-19 phobia and high-level thanatophobia. Awareness about the thanatophobia and COVID-19 phobia experienced by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic should be enhanced, and necessary measures should be taken.

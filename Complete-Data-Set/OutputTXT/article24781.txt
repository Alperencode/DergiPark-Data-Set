Makale Başlığı: Can obsessive compulsive disorder be detected in adolescent population with three- point scanning?
Özet: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has been reported in adolescent population commonly. Adolescents with OCD seek for treatment usually when their functionality has been destroyed significantly. Therefore scanning OCD in adolescent population is very important. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity, specifity, and predictability of the self reported three points scanning which can be fulfilled easily and fast. The study sample comprises of a total 177 high school first class students whose ages are between 14-17 years old. The results of OCD module of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I and the estimated results of three item Obsessive Compulsive scale derived from self reported Child Adolescent Behavior Assessment Scale have been compared. The OCD prevalence (at the moment) was 2.8% when calculated for structured interview. Potential OCD was 46% when calculated for Obsessive Compulsive Scale scanning. The sensitivity of three item CABAS-OCS was 60%, its specifity was 54%, positive predictive value 4%, and negative predictive value was 97%. Eventually, the sensitivity and specifity of the detection method of OCD by using three item scanning were intermediate. Its discrimination of non-OCD adolescents was satisfactory. Despite that positive prediction power was low and so this method should be redeveloped.

Makale Başlığı: Effect of fixation methods and various clones of Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (L) properties and antioxidant activity of Indonesian green tea
Özet: Fixation is essential in green tea processing to inactivate the polyphenol oxidase enzyme. In Indonesia, green tea is made from the Assam variety and produced using the panning method. Few studies are reported on green tea made from Indonesian clones of the Sinensis variety. This study aims to identify chemical characteristics, antioxidant activity, and sensory evaluation of green tea from local clones of the Sinensis variety (GMBS 2, GMBS 4, and GMBS 5) with different fixation methods (panning and steaming). The results show that the caffeine content of green tea products ranged from 2.51-2.59% and 2.67-2.74% for panning and steaming methods. The panning method produced green tea with higher total polyphenol and flavonoid content than the steaming method. Green tea with the panning method has an IC50 value of 14.45; 14.41; and 17.41 mg/L for GMBS 2, GMBS 4, and GMBS 5, respectively. The panning method resulted in a smaller IC50 value than the steaming method for GMBS 2 and GMBS 4 clones. The steaming method produced green tea with a higher taste, aroma, and total score than those the panning method. However, different fixation methods did not significantly affect the appearance, liquor color, and leaf infusion. In conclusion, different fixation methods on GMBS 2, GMB 4, and GMB 5 produced green tea products that met the Indonesian National Standard 3945:2016. Further research is needed to determine the role of the plucking period/season and the characteristics of volatile compounds of green tea from GMBS clones with different fixation methods.

Makale Başlığı: The Role of Social Media in the Formation, Development and Expression of New Religious Identity: The Case of Japanese Muslims
Özet: Social media plays a significant role in creating, shaping, maintaining and expressing religious identities of individuals in the contemporary world. The purpose of this research is to analyse to what extent social media is influential in creating and maintaining new religious identities of Japanese individuals who chose to become Muslim, and likewise, to what extent these Japanese Muslim converts use social media to express their new religious identities. The paper is based on the findings of the field study carried out in Japan for approximately two and a half years. Semi-structured interviews, participant observations and field notes were employed to collect the data. The interviews were conducted with a total of 62 people, 32 female and 30 male, aged between 19 and 81, using snowball and purposive sampling methods. Participation in the activities of various mosques, masjids and religious associations has frequently been ensured, and thus, communication with Japanese Muslims was continued, observations were made and field notes were kept. The data were examined from a phenomenological perspective to understand the relationship between social media and religious identity in terms of the experiences of Japanese Muslims. Although social media has little to no influence on the formation of Muslim identity, it plays a crucial role in maintaining it by establishing connections between Japanese Muslims who are a tiny minority scattered throughout Japan. However, it is not a popular medium for expressing and explaining their new religious identities to others.

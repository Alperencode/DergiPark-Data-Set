Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINIC AND GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS ADMITTED TO TRAKYA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL WITH HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY
Özet: Aims: This study aims to evaluate the genetics, clinical characteristics, and functional abnormalities of patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Trakya University Hospital. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted with patients who were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy between November 2009 - November 2019 in Trakya University Hospital. The data were obtained from the hospital’s database. Patients’ data (regarding age, gender, ge- netics, transthoracic echocardiogram findings, medications, types of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and first diagnoses) were examined. Numbers, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used as descriptive statistics. Results: Eleven patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were evaluated. Five (45.45%) were female and 6 (54.54%) were male. The mean age of the female patients was 58.20 ± 8.57 years. The most common type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was found to be asymmetrical septal cardiomyopathy [7 (63.63%)]. Three (27.27%) patients presented with hypertension. There were gene mutations in three patients. Among these three patients, two (18.18%) patients have MYBPC3, and one (9.09%) patient has TTN gene mutations. Conclusion: Hypertrophic car- diomyopathy is usually accompanied by comorbidities such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease. Therefore, these patients must be paid attention to in these matters.

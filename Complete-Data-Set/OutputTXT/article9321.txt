Makale Başlığı: Effects of maternal dietary patterns and maternal obesity on children's obesity
Özet: Aim: The effects of dietary patterns and dietary statuses of mothers on childhood obesity have not been understood clearly yet. This study aims to evaluate the dietary patterns of mothers and their dietary statuses on the obesity of children.Material and Method: This cross-sectional study included 295 mothers and their children, who were 2-6 years old. The participants' anthropometric measurements were carried out and the frequency of food consumption was also collected from the mothers in the study. Results: In the study, it was determined that the children of the participating mothers, who had high levels of income and education, had higher probabilities of being overweight/obese. Overweight/obesity in children was found to be significantly associated with maternal overweight/obesity (B=4.04, p<0.001).The results of our analyses demonstrated that maternal bread, rice, and sugar intake was strongly correlated with children’s obesity (B=3.65, p<0.001; B=3.17, p<0.001; B=8.32, p<0.001). In terms of the cards that were shown to the children, it was determined that the children preferred unhealthy snacks, such as biscuits, wafers, and carbonated drinks, more frequently rather than healthy food while preferring watching television and playing games on computers rather than physical activities.Conclusion: As the variables of income level, education level, BMI values, and consumption of bread, rice, and sugar in mothers were increased, it was determined that the probability of obesity in children, who were 2-6 years old, also increased. These results indicated hopeful outcomes in terms of preventing obesity in children by keeping the dietary patterns of mothers under control.

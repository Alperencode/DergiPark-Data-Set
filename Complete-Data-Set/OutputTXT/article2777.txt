Makale Başlığı: Comparative Analysis of Geosynthetic Reinforced Earth Wall and Reinforced Concrete Retaining Wall: Kastamonu-Karabuk Highway Case Study
Özet: Embankment is a frequently encountered application in road and railway constructions. In this study, reinforced concrete retaining wall, which is one of the traditional engineering structures and constructed to provide fill stabilization, and geosynthetic (geogrid) reinforced retaining structure were analyzed comparatively by considering cost, construction time, duration for service, service life, and aesthetics criteria. The comparisons were carried out on the engineering structures in two different locations on the same highway, which are under responsibility of the General Directorate of Highways (KGM). In the first location, a reinforced concrete retaining wall was designed instead of the existing geosynthetic reinforced wall, while a geosynthetic reinforced wall was designed instead of the existing reinforced concrete retaining wall in the second location. Cost analyses were made in line with KGM items. It was concluded that geosynthetic reinforced earth walls became advantageous in terms of cost, especially in parallel with the increase in height. In addition, it is revealed that geosynthetic reinforced walls are more advantageous when their performance is evaluated in terms of construction time, duration for service, service life and aesthetics criteria. It is thought that the data obtained from results of the study will contribute decision makers to decide the most appropriate engineering structure in terms of both performance and cost at the locations where filling stability problems arise in highway construction.

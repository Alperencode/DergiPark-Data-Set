Makale Başlığı: The Opportunıty of Freedom of Wıll and The Nature of Values In The Phılosophy of Ziya Gökalp: The Theory of Husn and Qubh
Özet: Abstract In this article, it is aimed to evaluate Ziya Gökalp's views on freedom of will and value judgments in the context of husn - qubh theory in terms of consistency by considering them as a whole. Bringing a new perspective to the discussion of whether good and evil can be known by reason or revelation in traditional theology, the thinker will claim that society is the determining factor in this regard, with the influence of positivist philosophy. The thinker's views on both freedom of will and values are shaped according to his society-centered philosophy. According to him, the only place where value judgments that exceed human will are based on society. Society both limits the freedom of people and determines their value judgments. In Gökalp, both the possibility of freedom of will in social life and the passive position of the individual in the face of values are dealt with in a very striking way.

Makale Başlığı: THE ANALYSIS OF COLUMNS AND NEWS ON  TURKISH PRINTED MEDIA ABOUT INCEST  BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 2008-2017
Özet: Incest is a human’s rights violation and social disaster, which is nearly impossible to fight against on one’s own, and when is not intervened that can influence individuals, familial relations, society and future generations. Its obscurity and its unwillingness to be acknowledged by people come from the reason that it occurs inside “the family/home” where our sense of belonging and characteristics are developed. Incest, a human rights violation by its widest meaning, is seen as a crime that is impossible to be committed because of the moral codes and sacredness of familial relations in Turkey. Even having no place in law codes, incest is similarly in a position of invisibility on press. From this point forth, this study is based on the hypothesis that even though incest exists as a perpetual problem, Turkish printed media present this problem rather as surprising, extraordinary and discontinuous. The data acquired in this study, which analyze the past ten years (2008-2017) of Turkish printed media by means of quantitative analysis method, -unfortunately- affirm this hypothesis. The purpose of this study isto s put forward the attitude of Turkish printed media on incest, in other words, domestic violence/ abuse and to contribute to raising sensitivity in public opinion. Further, it also aims to present the required system and the significance and necessity of media on fighting against incest in terms of identifying the lacking aspects of current administrations.

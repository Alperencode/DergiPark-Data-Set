Makale Başlığı: OF MESTIZA CONSCIOUSNESS AND CULTURAL SCHIZOPHRENIA: INGLOURIOUS BASTARD OF TURKISH LITERATURE IN GÖLGELER VE HAYALLER ŞEHRİNDE
Özet: This article analyzes Murat Gülsoy’s approach to intellectual as one of the mostcontroversial topics in Turkish literature in his novel titled Gölgeler ve Hayaller Şehrinde,comparatively with Inglourious Basterds by Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino’s portrayal ofthe holocaust with different fiction is the only starting point of this analysis. Throughoutthis novel, Gülsoy questions the criticisms on Turkish intellectual, who has beenan image of the other in Turkish literature, building a gateway between the mestizaconsciousness of intellectual and our consciousness. The fact that the main characterof the novel, Fuat, opens his heart to the reader transparently and sincerely, almosttransforming his mestiza consciousness into a mirror in which the reader can watchhimself/herself. The author can capture this sincerity and transparency thanks to theepistolary novel. This article claims that Murat Gülsoy objects to the intellectual chosenas the scapegoat for our modernization story in Turkish literature.

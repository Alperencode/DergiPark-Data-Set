Makale Başlığı: Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Weighted Vote Based Ensemble Classification Algorithm
Özet: Breast cancer is a disease that is among the second causes of death among women, but its fatal risk is reduced with early diagnosis and the right treatment method. Currently, a large number of classification algorithms in data mining fields are adapted to breast cancer diagnosis based on patients' past medical records. With the help of these algorithms, the accuracy of diagnosis in diseases is significantly increased. In this study, a weighted vote-based ensemble classification algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The proposed algorithm is based on the working principle of more than one classification algorithm. By combining the classification algorithms with the weighted voting method, the result obtained from each algorithm alone is improved. The proposed weighted vote-based community classification algorithm consists of four stages. The first stage is the data preprocessing stage, followed by the classification stage. In the third stage, the reclassification process is carried out by using the weighted vote-based community classification algorithm with the performance values obtained from the classification process. With the proposed algorithm, an accuracy value of %98.77 was obtained, and a better value was obtained than the individual performance of each classification algorithm used in the classification phase.

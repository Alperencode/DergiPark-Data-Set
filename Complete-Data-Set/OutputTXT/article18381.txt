Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Effect of Budget Policies on Income Distribution in Turkey
Özet: Budget policies, in addition to being a document showing the income and expenditure balance of the budget, are also very important in terms of ensuring/maintaining macroeconomic stability in the context of the government's income structure, expenditure composition and borrowing-related policies. States can provide the said stability with budget balance, as well as with budget deficits/surpluses. One of the main duties of the state is to ensure social development. The way to do this is through the fair distribution of income in the society. To do this, they use budgetary policy tools such as taxes and spending on education, health and social protection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the budget policies implemented by the states on the income distribution in Turkey. Starting from the determined purpose, first of all, general information about budget policies and income distribution is given. Afterwards, the relations between taxes, education, health and social protection expenditures and income distribution are mentioned. Finally, income distributions in Turkey were evaluated in the context of applied budget policies.

Özet: INTRODUCTION: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are commonly seen in immunosuppressive patients. Early diagnosis is key to optimizing antifungal treatment success. Betaglucan (BG) assay can detect most of the fungal pathogens except mucormycosis and Cryptococcus. In this study we aimed to evaluate the value of BG as a diagnostic tool in patients with hematological malignancy and IFI.METHODS: Forty-six hematological malignancy patients under induction and consolidation chemotherapy that expected to have neutropenia for more than 14 days with no clinical and radiological signs of IFI are included in this study. Blood Galactomannan (GM) and BG levels were measured 2 times in a week during the hospitalization period. Method A (proven + probable groups vs non IFI) and Method B (proven + probable + possible groups vs. non IFI) variables were determined to assess the sensitivity, specifity and predictive values.RESULTS: In method A; BG test's sensitivity, specifity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) was determined as 68.75%, 84.1%, 52.4%, 91.4% respectively. In method B (proven + probable + possible groups vs. non IFI) BG test sensitivity, specifity, PPV, NPV was determined as 60%, 88.9%, 71.4%, and 82.8% respectively.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Depending on our data and present literature; we conclude that BG and GM is a non-invasive contributory test for the diagnosis of IFI The current treatment of the symptomatic extremity

Makale Başlığı: A Case Study on the Implementation of Targeted Effect Levels on Gamification in the Context of Marketing Communication
Özet: The research used the "Starbucks Reward" gamification to examine the stages of gamification in the field of marketing communication. It has been tried to find how gamification is used as a channel in the field of marketing communication and how the brand, which has targeted the top step of the effect level pyramid, converts its "customer" into a "player." It can be seen that this gamification, which the brand designed as a loyalty program, targets the "values" stage, which is the highest step of the effect level pyramid. The type of "achievers" suitable with the brand's core audience is targeted, according to Bartle's taxonomy. It uses the "product" system, according to the SAPS reward system. According to the study's key findings, even though the gamification design initiated within a mobile application, the "awareness and knowledge" effect levels were applied in the field where marketing communication tools are used. During the gamification process, the "customer" progressed through several levels of influence, first becoming a "user" and then a "player." It has been revealed that gamification is maintainable in the loyalty program, which targets the values stage as the level of effect, because the product sold by the brand and the product given as gifts are the same.

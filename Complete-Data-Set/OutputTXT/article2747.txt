Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON ERGONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ENGINEERING STUDENTS
Özet: Ergonomics is the applied science of designing and arranging things for human use in such a way that they interact and increase productivity in an efficient and safe manner. Our study is of cross-sectional type and the population of the study was composed of 85 Industrial Engineering students and 66 Mechanical Engineering students from the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, and a total of 151 people, and the data were collected and analyzed online. In this study, the basic and scientific principles of ergonomics in engineering faculties, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on ergonomic conditions and the resulting results were examined and compared before and after the pandemic. In our study, more than 50% of the participants were industrial engineering students, between the ages of 18-22, with a GPA of 2.1-2.9, spending more than 5 hours at the desk, non-smoker, pre-pandemic vitamin D supplementation. It is in the profile that does not take regular exercise and sports habits, does not have any complaints of low back pain, and pays attention to ergonomic conditions, albeit partially. After the pandemic, the profile shown before the pandemic continued in more than 50% of the participants, and vitamin D supplement intake, low back pain complaints, attention to ergonomic conditions and weight gain increased, while regular exercise-sport habits decreased.

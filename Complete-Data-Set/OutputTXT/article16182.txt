Makale Başlığı: The Problem of Objectivity in Science in Imre Lakatos
Özet: From the 17th century, new scientific developments accompanied science philosophers started to discuss how to distinguish scientific propositions from metaphysics. That problem was replaced by how to discriminate between scientific and non-scientific in the 20th century. In that period, different scientific understandings started to come up. Imre Lakatos is one of the leading thinkers who came forward with his views during this period. In Lakatos’ view, not being rational criteria for scientific knowledge was relativised natural sciences developing sciences such as social sciences, ethics and science fields were too and this caused dangerous results. Due to that, Lakatos defends the importance of determining criteria to distinguish scientific knowledge from non-scientific one. He says that the history of science must be known for the philosophy of science well and philosophy of science must be known for the history of science well. Lakatos says that there aren’t certain verification and falsification in science; for to him, science is fallible at the same time. He advocates that there aren’t certain and unchangeable methods in science. Due to his ideas, he affected Feyerabend. Lakatos asserted that science is progressing rationally; he is against Popper and Kuhn but tried to synthesize between them.

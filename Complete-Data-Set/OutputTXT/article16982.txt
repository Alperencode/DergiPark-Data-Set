Özet: The aim of this research is to examine the problems faced by teachers in foreign language teaching. The research includes studies that try to determine the problems faced by teachers in foreign language teaching, reading, writing, especially listening and speaking skills, in primary, high school and undergraduate education institutions located in different provinces in Turkey between the years 2010-2020. The researches in question were taken from databases open to online access. The research design was carried out with qualitative research. Document analysis was used as the data collection method. Research data were analyzed by content analysis. According to the results of the research, it was determined that the activities involving the reading, writing, listening and speaking skills of the foreign language teaching program were at a challenging level for the students, and that the teachers stated that the program was not suitable for the students' readiness levels. In addition, the results of the research on this subject showed that the teachers' needs were not met in terms of materials, classroom environment and other opportunities. Again, it was stated by the teachers that the measurement and evaluation methods and techniques, which should be prepared in accordance with the communicative skill objectives of the program, were insufficient and inappropriate.

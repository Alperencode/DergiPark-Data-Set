Makale Başlığı: NEWS CONTENT PRESENTATION IN PODCAST BROADCASTING
Özet: Advancements in communication technologies have brought about radical changes in the field of journalism as wall as in many other fields. In today’s digital era, journalistic practices, types of journalism and citizens' news consumption habits and preferences are also changing rapidly. Today, podcasts, which communication technologies have introduced as an alternative type of digital journalism, are becoming increasingly widespread. This study aims to examine the nature of podcasting, its contributions to journalism, its effectiveness as a news medium and the reflections of podcast journalism by journalists and news platforms in Turkey. In this context, within the scope of the study, the podcasts by MedyaScope, Kısa Dalga, Ünsal Ünlü and Nevşin Mengü, which are most listened to by news followers, were analyzed between June 1st,2022 and June 30th, 2022 by means of categorical classification and content analysis methods. According to the findings of the study, podcasts produced by journalists were longer in terms of broadcasting time compared to the podcasts produced by media platforms and featured more content on recent developments in the country. Furthermore the podcasts produced by media platforms in Turkey were derived from the radio content or YouTube content of the relevant platform without being produced specifically for podcast journalism. In this context, it can be concluded that podcasts in Turkey are insufficient in terms of quality. However, it is promising for the future of podcast journalism that podcasts prepared by journalists are produced specifically for the relevant medium by using primary source content and that such podcasts are increasing.

Makale Başlığı: The Evaluation of Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction in Stroke Patients
Özet: Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) is common after stroke, and it is a condition that negatively affects the functional status and quality of life of the patients. This study aimed to evaluate bladder functions and explore the risk factors for NLUTD in chronic stroke patients. Seventy-one patients with a history of stroke attack at least 6 months ago were included in the study. Case group consisted of 35 patients having NLUTD diagnosed by urodynamic study and the control group consisted of 36 patients without any urinary complaints. The demographics of the patients were evaluated. In addition, presenting complaints, urinary histories and voiding methods of the patients were questioned. Bladder functions of stroke patients with urinary complaints were evaluated through urodynamic study reports. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of age, gender, educational status, time since stroke, lesion side and lesion type (p>0.05). Urodynamic studies revealed overactive detrusor and decreased bladder capacity in 85.7% of the patients. Urinary dysfunction did not show any significant difference (p˃0.05) according to lesion side and etiology. The rate of urinary dysfunction was significantly higher (p=0.019) in patients with large lesions. Large infarct size, low cognitive level, and presence of accompanying pathologies were described as risk factors for NLUTD. A detailed history and videourodynamic evaluation are important in the diagnosis of NLUTD.

Makale Başlığı: Sustainable Development Goals and Islamic Finance Perspective
Özet: Sustainable development, as a common task of humanity, represents the will to meet the needs of today's humanity and transfer it to future generations by wisely managing the resources necessary for the survival of generations without wasting them. In this study, the contribution of Islamic economics and finance to sustainability efforts and the opportunities it can offer are investigated by emphasizing this understanding that is compatible with the Islamic finance perspective. As a result of the research, it has been understood that Islamic economics can make great contributions to sustainable development through Islamic banks, social finance tools such as zakat, waqf, sadaqah, qard-al hasan, Islamic microfinance, Islamic crowdfunding, and the human model that will be revealed by Islamic finance education. In addition, it is claimed that sustainable development efforts are unsuccessful due to financial crises and environmental problems caused by capitalist understanding.

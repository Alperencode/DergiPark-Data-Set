Makale Başlığı: Potassium and Salicylic Acid Fertilization Effects on Productive and Qualitative Traits of Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba Under Drought Stress
Özet: Drought is one of the main factors of abiotic stress in the agricultural world. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of drought on Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.)  Plant and finally improve the productivity of the grain yield and the qualitative characteristics in case of high dryness by spraying salicylic acid and potassium. This experiment was performed as a plot divided into strips in a randomized complete block with three replicates over two years in Kerman, Iran. Experimental treatments include drought stress at three levels, salicylic acid (three levels) by foliar application, and potassium (two levels). Guar is resistant to high drought stress and has had a significantly improved yield. Applying 100 kg/ha of potassium in combination with a foliar spray with salicylic acid produced the highest potassium and cereal protein content. The results clearly demonstrated that potassium and salicylic acid application at all levels of drought stress and dry conditions had a positive effect on cereal yield and quality features.

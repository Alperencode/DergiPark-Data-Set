Makale Başlığı: IGF-1/CaC8I, LEP/NmuCI and PRLR/Hin1II Polymorphisms in Saanen Goats
Özet: Objective: This study was aimed to identify IGF-1, LEP and PRLR polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP method in Saanen goats.Material and Methods: In the study, nasal samples were collected from 72 Saanen goats via swabs and DNA was extracted. Polymorphisms of IGF-1, LEP and PRLR were determined by PCR amplification followed by RFLP method using restriction enzymes Cac8I, NmuCI and Hin1II, respectively. Results: LEP/NmuCI produced three genotypes as TT, TC and CC with frequencies 90.3, 6.9 and 2.8%, respectively and two alleles (T=93.8%, C=6.2%). The frequencies of genotype for PRLR gene were CC (90.3%), CT (5.5%) and TT (4.2%) and allele frequencies were C (93.1%) and T (6.9%). The IGF-1/Cac8I locus was monomorphic in Saanen goat population. Conclusion: The present results may be useful for future studies conducted on goat genome with respect to IGF-1, LEP and PRLR genes.

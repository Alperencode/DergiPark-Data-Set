Makale Başlığı: The effect of working life quality of hotel employees on individual creativity performance
Özet: This study determined how the working life quality of hotel employees affects their individual creativity performance. Survey data were collected in June-July 2018 from 310 hotel employees working in five-star hotels in Bodrum district, Muğla province, Turkey. Correlation analysis indicated positive, moderate and weak relationships between working life quality and individual creativity. A regression analysis was then performed to test the research hypotheses. This showed that career opportunities and work safety significantly affected individual creativity. However, working conditions and wages and earnings had no significant effect on individual creativity. The results of this research have great importance because it is the first research that investigates the effect of the quality of working life on individual creativity performance of employees working in hospitality businesses in Turkey.

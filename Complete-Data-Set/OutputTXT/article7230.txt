Makale Başlığı: Sulfuric Acid Resistance of Pumice Based Geopolymer Mortars with Fly Ash and Calcium Aluminate Cement Additives
Özet: In this study, pumice based geopolymer (PGP) mortars were produced by replacing 10, 20, and 30 wt.% of the pumice with fly ash and/or calcium aluminate cement. After curing at ambient temperature and 60 °C, the mortars were placed in a 5% sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution on the 28th day and kept for 120 days. The change in appearance, weight loss and residual compressive strength of the PGP samples due to the effect of sulfuric acid were determined on the 60th and 120th days and compared with the Portland Cement based reference mortar. The study showed that the reference samples underwent a weight loss of 25.6% at the end of 60 days by dissolving of hardened cement paste in the sulfuric acid medium. However, it was observed that the PGP mortars did not undergo any visual change in sulfuric acid solution, except for the samples containing 20 and 30% calcium aluminate cement (for ambient curing). In addition, it was determined that the PGP samples cured at ambient temperature and 60 °C had a maximum weight loss of 6.5% and 4.1, respectively, at the end of 120 days. PGP mortars underwent compressive strength losses of up to 70% in the 120-day sulfuric acid solution. However, with sufficient fly ash and calcium aluminate cement substitution, the compressive strength of PGP mortars increased significantly as well as the sulfuric acid resistance.

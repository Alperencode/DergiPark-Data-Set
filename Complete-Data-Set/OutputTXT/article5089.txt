Makale Başlığı: A Study of Users' Proclivity to Access News on the Axis of Digital Transformation
Özet: The purpose of this research is to find an answer to one of the fundamental questions about the copyright of news content published on the internet and the future of online news content production. Hereof, “Is access to online news content on the internet a free right for users, or is it viewed as a commercial value that can be accessed for a fee?” According to the findings obtained from the study with 385 users; it has been observed that users who follow daily news have a low proclivity to pay digital platforms to access their news content. On the other hand, the target audience with the highest proclivity to pay for online news content has been identified as male users between the ages of 20 and 29 who have a habit of purchasing services from other digital platforms and following daily news. According to the data, online news content is not seen as having a commercial value like other digital platforms where services are purchased, and the proclivity for free access is higher among users who follow daily news.

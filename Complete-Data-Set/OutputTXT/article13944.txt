Makale Başlığı: The Roman Lamps found in 2019 at Seleuceia Sidera
Özet: AbstractSeleuceia Sidera is one of the important cities of ancient Pisidia. Yet research carried out in the city is still in its initial stage. Therefore, finds yielded by systematic excavations are limited so far. Several examples of oil lamps have been found in the excavations carried out in the city over the last two seasons. In this study, 13 examples selected from a group of poorly defined fragmentary lamps and dated between the 1st and 7th centuries AD are evaluated. It is understood that four types of lamps are wheel-made while the others are mould-made. Among these lamps, mould produced lamps stand out with a rate of 69%. Archaeometric analysis of the lamps could not be executed so far. Having said that, initial visual analysis of the objects indicated that the wheel-made lamps are characterised by a clay structure compatible with the examples from Sagalassos. Apart from this, some samples were found to be typologically similar to the oil lamps found predominantly in the Aegean coastal cities. This point, albeit preliminary, is important in terms of our understanding of the commercial ties of the Pisidian city. Based on our current knowledge of the lamps, it would not be wrong to suggest that the city of Seleuceia Sidera interacted with the cities of the Western and Southwestern Anatolia.Key Words: Seleuceia Sidera, Oil lamp, Roman Period, Production

Makale Başlığı: COMPARISON OF LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY LEVELS OF EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES
Özet: The world, which has become a global village, has faced many problems such as the increasing climate crisis, population growth, and carbon emissions. Adopting the philosophy of sustainability, which is seen as a solution to these problems, has become a necessity. One of the prominent areas in sustainable development in societies with different levels of development is the logistics sector. So determining the relationship between the logistics performances of the European Union countries, which have an important place in World Trade, and the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability, and comparing them constitute the main motivation of the research. In this context, in this study, first of all, the data of 14 criteria, which are considered to be effective in determining the sustainability levels of the European Union countries, were compiled from the World Bank website. ROC technique was used to weight the criteria. Then, using these criteria weights and the criteria values of 2018, the European Union countries were ranked according to their sustainability levels with the help of the OCRA technique. Finally, as a result of the comparison made between the Logistics Performance Index and the sustainability levels, a positive and low level correlation was determined between the two data sets.

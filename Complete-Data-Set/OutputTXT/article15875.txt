Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of obstetric outcomes in adolescent pregnancies delivered by cesarean section: Single center experience
Özet: Aim: Adolescent pregnancies; defined as pregnancies in women aged 10-19 years old are still an important public health problem and must be considered as high risk pregnancies with increased maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity rates. In this study, we aimed to examine the obstetric and perinatal outcomes in adolescent pregnancies delivered with cesarean section (CS) and compare the outcomes in determined adolescent age groups.Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, the obstetric and perinatal outcomes in 2665 adolescent patients who delivered with cesarean section were examined in three groups divided according to the age of delivery: group 1 included the patients aged 14-15 years old, group 2 the patients aged 16-17 years old and group 3 the patients aged 18-19 years old. The outcomes were compared between the identified age groups.Results: The incidence of preterm delivery was higher in group 1 compared with group 2 and group 3 (p=0.001) and 52.3% of group 1 patients had delivered between 29-34 gestational weeks. Fetal birth weight and APGAR scores were lower and need for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was higher in group 1. In group 3 116 (8.4%) patients had postpartum hemorrhage which was higher than group 1 and group 2 with statistically significant difference (p=0.001). Conclusion: Preterm delivery, low birth weight, low APGAR scores and need for NICU are higher in 15-17 years old adolescents delivered with C/S whereas postpartum hemorrhage and need for blood transfusion is higher in adolescents aged 18-19 years old.

Makale Başlığı: Interview with Sir David Logan, British Ambassador to Ankara (1997-2001)
Özet: Let me start with the first question, then. You served in the British Embassy in Ankara between 1965 and 1969, and then you came back as Ambassador between 1997 and 2001. These were very eventful periods in Turkish history. What could you tell us about your observations? First of all, during 1969, with particular reference to the diplomatic, economic, military and cultural relations between Turkey and Britain.

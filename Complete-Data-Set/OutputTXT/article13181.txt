Makale Başlığı: Linear Instability and Numerical Analysis of Surface Morphology Changes of Epitaxially Strained Thin Films Due to Elastic Interactions
Özet: In this systematic simulation study, thin-film surface stability has been investigated with consideration of elastic dipole interactions under compression and tension. In this model, the effect of stress on surface diffusion is introduced by first and second-order parameters. Preexistent sinusoidal wave formed surface of the thin films is assumed and decay or growth of this form due to the diffusion is investigated with the combined effect of capillary, stress, and elastic dipole interactions. It has been shown that elastic dipole interactions cause the different surface dynamics under the compression and the tension, and this difference caused crack like formations on the surface over critical compression stress (σ>100 MPa). On the other hand, wave-formed thin film surface decays with tensile stress. Three different regions were observed according to the applied stress; the area where decaying has occurred (Ξ >0) under tensile load, the region the surface is stable where the low compression force (-1,12>Ξ > 0) is applied, and the high compressive stress (Ξ<-1,12), where crack-like formations are observed. After the crack formation, surface kinetics deviates from the linear instability analysis. During the crack formation, mass flow due to the diffusion results in creating new crests at the surface or filling in the trough.

The study is a descriptive study conducted via a relational survey model. During data analysis, the results obtained from correlation and regression analyzes were given along with discussions and interpretations. The initial result indicated that sports managers have high self-confidence in decision-making. According to regression analysis, only the internal-self-confidence was found to be a significant predictor of the decision-making style.

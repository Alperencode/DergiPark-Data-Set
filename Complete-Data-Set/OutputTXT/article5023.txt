Makale Başlığı: GLOBALIZATION, MIGRATION AND ASYLUM
Özet: Today, with the effect of globalization, the concepts of time and space lose their importance compared to the past, and country borders are disappearing. The effects of globalization should not be seen as the isomorphism of distant settlements in the context of consumption habits, pleasure and entertainment worlds due to the developments in information and communication technologies of people in different geographies. Beyond that, borders actually disappear. Every year, thousands and even hundreds of thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers are joined, and sometimes millions more due to violent regional conflicts. The inequality between societies creates a social migration movement from the east to the west, from poverty to wealth, from poverty to welfare, from underdevelopment to development, due to the longing for a life in rights and justice, under the sociological theory of unified containers. In this context, this study aims to provide a conceptual explanation on the phenomenon of immigration and asylum in accordance with the universal and normative principles and principles, with a holistic and axiological point of view.

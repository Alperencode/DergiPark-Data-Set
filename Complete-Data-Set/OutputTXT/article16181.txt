Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Early Ahl-i Hadith and Ibn Taymiyyah Salafism on Indian Ahl-i Hadith School
Özet: Ahl al-hadith is a common name used for schools that emerged in India both in the classical period and in the recent period, which based on understanding verses and hadiths in a literalist way. These schools, which emerged under different times and conditions, have common aspects as well as different aspects. For this reason, it should be determined who the Ahl-i hadith is, and then its common and different aspects with the Indian A’hl-i hadith should be revealed. In the majority of these studies, the A’hl al-hadith of India has been seen as a continuation of the Wahhabi movement. In this research, which was carried out to clarify the connection between the Ahl al-Hadith of the first period and the Ahl-i Hadith of India, firstly, the subjects that the two schools approached differently were determined. Afterwards, the emergence of these ideas was examined and the relationship between the two schools was tried to be determined. In the study, it was concluded that the principles such as taqlid and tawassul used by the Ahl al-Hadith of India to describe themselves are not from the Ahl al-Hadith, but from Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyya and Shawkani.

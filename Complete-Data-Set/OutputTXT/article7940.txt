Özet: Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a blood glucose measurement skills assessment scale in adolescents aged 12-18 years with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.Method: The study is of methodological type and was conducted with 309 adolescents aged 12-18 years who were diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus and volunteered to participate in the study. The 'Descriptive Information Form' and the developed 'Blood Glucose Measurement Skills Draft Form' consisting of 35 items were used in the research. SPSS 25.0 and Amos package programs were used for data analysis. Content validity of the 'Blood Glucose Measurement Skills Draft Forum' Davis Technique was used. Cronbach Alpha coefficient, item-total score correlations, explanatory and confirmatory factor analyzes were used for the validity and reliability of the scale.Results: Factor analysis results supported the 28-item as multidimensional with five domains. In adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus between the ages of 12 and 18, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value of the Blood Glucose Measurement Skills Assessment Scale was 0.888, and the result of the Bartlett's Test was found to be statistically highly significant (X2 = 7207.466). The content validity index of the scale items was between 0.85 and 1.00, factor loadings were between 0.61 and 0.96, item-total score correlations were between 0.427 and 0.653 and the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of the sub-dimensions was between 0.895 and 0.946 indicating high reliability.Conclusion: The 'Scale for Evaluation of Blood Glucose Measurement Skills in Adolescents aged 12-18 with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (BGMS-A)' developed in our study is a five-point Likert type, and it is a valid and reliable scale consisting of 28 items and 5 sub-dimensions.

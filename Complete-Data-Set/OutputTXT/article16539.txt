Makale Başlığı: Integration of Different Conceptual Change Methods into the 5E Model: An Example of Fluid Pressure
Özet: The aim of this study was to develop and present a teaching activity based on the integration of conceptual change methods consisting of concept cartoon, Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE) technique, analogy and conceptual change text into the 5E model in order to remedy misconceptions about fluid pressure in the 8th grade of secondary school. Concept cartoon, TGA technique, analogy and conceptual change texts developed for this purpose were placed in a worksheet according to the 5E model. The purpose of developing the worksheet is to enable the teacher and the student to follow the lesson more easily. This study has remained at the theoretical level and has not been applied and tested to be effective in remedying misconceptions. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the worksheets developed in this study may be the subject of another research. It is believed that the worksheets enriched by the integration of different conceptual change methods developed within the scope of the research into the 5E model will be a resource for researchers and teachers in this field.

Makale Başlığı: Interpretation of Verses Regarding Orphans
Özet: Human beings, the most honorable of the creatures, have two fundamental responsibilities for Allah and other creatures. The primary responsibility of men to other creatures regards the orphans and their care and needs. Caring and the orphans and meeting their basic needs are such valuable duties that Islam orders Muslims to do so. Thus, the Quran underlines the significance of the position of orphans and gives many advice and rules that believers must follow. In this study, It is proposed that the concept and the position of the “being an orphan” were discussed through the orders and statements mentioned in the Quran. The methodology of this study is based on the verses in the Quran and then these verses were interpreted by the classical and modern tafsir methods. Also, many other studies previously done regarding these issues were comparatively used. After describing the term “ orphan” some other issues regarding orphans were discussed such as protecting, rehabilitating, and caring for, them. Moreover, it is underlined that orphans should be married and their rights should not be lurched. Lastly, the situation expressing how orphanhood ends is evaluated. In short, the general point of view regarding orphanhood was portrayed out through the Quranic verses.

Makale Başlığı: Turkish Verb Copies in Laz Vocabulary
Özet: Laz is a local language spoken in Turkey, mainly in the eastern districts of Rize and in the regions up to the Georgian border. Laz language, which is shown among the Caucasian languages and included in the group of agglutinative languages such as Turkish, is in danger of extinction according to the UNESCO World Atlas of Languages in Danger. Laz is a language that has close relations with Turkish, this relationship goes back to ancient times. The Ottoman conquest of the Eastern Black Sea region in the 15th century was a turning point for Laz-Turkish relations. After this date, Turkish culture started to dominate the region, Turkish became adstratum in the region, and Laz speakers began to use Turkish. As a result of this situation, Laz vocabulary has also been under the influence of Turkish. Different types of words such as adjectives, adverbs, verbs and meanings were copied from Turkish to Laz. In this study, Turkish verb copies in Laz spoken in Ortacalar village of Arhavi are emphasized. As a result of the examination and research, it was determined that nine verbs such as obeceu (becermek), oçalişu (çalışmak), odusunu (düşünmek), oǩisǩanu (kıskanmak) were copied. It has been seen that these verbs are compatible with Laz sound and pronunciation features and take shape according to Laz grammar rules. This shows that Turkish does not have a grammatical effect on Laz language, it only affects the vocabulary. These verb copies seen in the vocabulary reveal the depth and intensity of the Turkish influence on Laz.

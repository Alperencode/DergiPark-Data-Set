Makale Başlığı: Do the Sociodemographic Factors and Body Mass Index Have an Impact on Food Safety Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices?
Özet: It was aimed to evaluate the relation between food safety knowledge, attitude, and behavior, with some socio-demographic factors and body mass index (BMI). The study was conducted on 1647 volunteer university students (1243 females and 404 males) attending at various universities in Ankara, Turkey. The data was collected via a questionnaire applied face to face interview which consisted of totally 95 items on demographic information (15 items), food safety knowledge (40 items), food safety attitude (15 items), and food safety behavior (25 items). Weight and height of the students were measured by the researches, and BMI was calculated and evaluated using World Health Organization classification. Food safety knowledge scores (FSKS) (27.3±5.54 versus 25.1±5.64, p<0.001), food safety attitude scores (FSAS) (14.5±4.02 versus 12.6±4.36, p<0.001) and food safety behavior scores (FSBS) (14.5±4.02 versus 12.6±4.36, p<0.001) were found to be statistically higher in women than males. Total FSKS, FSAS, and FSBS were significantly higher in the students educated in the field of health compared to others. FSKS, FSAS, and FSBS of the obese group were significantly lower than normal weight and underweight groups. As BMI increased, FSKS, FSAS, and FSBS were significantly decreased (r=-0.106, p<0.001; r=-0.130, p<0.001; r=-0.095, p<0.001, respectively). The results of this study reveal the gender and BMI differences on food safety knowledge, food safety attitudes, and food safety practices, and also has shown positive impact of health education status. In order to increase food safety knowledge and to reflect this knowledge on attitudes and behaviors, it is thought that it will be beneficial to give priority to male students, students in the obese group, and students studying in the field of social and science in the trainings to be planned on the subject.

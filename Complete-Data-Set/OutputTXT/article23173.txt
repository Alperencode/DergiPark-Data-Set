Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATIVES: A PRACTICE ON THE FRESH FOOD MARKET EXAMPLE
Özet: The pandemic process has once again revealed the importance of the agricultural sector and access to safefood in Turkey, as well as all around the world. The Turkish economy also experiences high food inflation, which is higher than there latively high headline inflation. While significant structural issues such as exchange rate dependence, supply problems, and rising energy prices are causing food price increases in Turkey, an excess of intermediaries in the system from the producer to the final consumer in agricultural product trade also emerges as a majorissue. To address the main issue raised in many studies, it is aimed that agricultural development cooperatives established by farmers in there gion where they produce will be integrated into the marketing system, and the cooperative's members' products will be delivered to retail outlets for consumption with out the use of intermediaries. However, the number of cooperatives capable of achieving this situation is insufficient to have an impact on the market. Local governments, which are the closes tunits of the state to citizens, have added agricultural and live stock support to their economic activities with the metropolitan law, which entered into force in 2014.The aim of the study is to develop a model address in the establishment of a system that excludes unregistered intermediaries from the herbal product marketing system and instead brings the herbal products directly to the market through agricultural development cooperatives. Furthermore, the importance of local government support and its effects on the sector will be revealed through the example of the Project titled "Developing the Marketing Capacity of Cooperatives in Collaboration with Yenişehir Municipality and Agricultural Development Cooperatives," which received Development Agency financial support. According to the present findings, producer and consumer welfare will improve, cooperative institutional and economic capacities will be strengthened, and the informal economy can be avoided through cooperative support projects, based on the fact that local governments area ware of the root causes of the problem in productionareas, as well as the capabilities and capabilities of agricultural development cooperatives.

Makale Başlığı: The Relations Between the Ottoman State and the Armenian Patriarchate in the Process of the World War I
Özet: The Istanbul Armenian Patriarchate was the religious and political leadership authority of the Ottoman Armenians. In view of this status, the patriarchate was undoubtedly one of the important actors in the Armenian issue. Incidences during the process of the emergence and developments of the Armenian issue occasionally led to confrontations between the patriarchate and the state, and sometimes even with other powers of the Armenian population. The patriarchate, that acted as an intermediary authority for the two parties regarding both the state’s expectations and demands of the Armenian population, also served as a mediating and balance enforcing authority. In view of this, the patriarchate was confronted with many problems. Although the legal status of the patriarchate did not change with the Constitutional era, the political process during this period had a major impact on the patriarchate. This study will be examining the patriarchate’s expectations from the state and mutual relations since the beginning of the Constitutional era, and attempt to reveal the outcome of developments during the war on the state-patriarchate relations. In addition to patriarchate’s relations with the state before and during the war, the stance of the Etchmiadzin Catholicosate towards the patriarchate and the state’s expectations from the patriarchate will be among the main topics of this study.

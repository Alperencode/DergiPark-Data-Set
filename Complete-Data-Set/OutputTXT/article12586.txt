Makale Başlığı: Asia-Europe Meeting: An Evaluation in the Context of Summit Diplomacy
Özet: This study evaluates Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), one of the channels of interaction between Asia and Europe, in the context of summit diplomacy. ASEM is a multi-dimensional and multi-actor interaction platform, including regional organizations, states, various groups and civil society. ASEM summits, the attendants of which are the heads of state or government of the participating states, the Presidents of the European Council and of the European Commission, and the Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have a key position in this structure. But the effectiveness of ASEM, a flexible and informal platform, is controversial. It is stated that the political documents published after the summits do not turn into concrete results, and the effectiveness of ASEM in global governance is limited. However, ASEM, a form of interregional relations, presents an interaction channel for the actors in two continents, and the direct participation of political leaders in the process shows the awareness of the participating states towards this interaction channel. In this framework, the study discusses how the summits, which are compatible with the characteristics and functioning of ASEM, contribute to the dialogue process and global governance.

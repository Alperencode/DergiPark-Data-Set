Makale Başlığı: EXAMPLE OF USING 3D PRINTERS IN HOSPITAL BIOMEDICAL UNITS
Özet: Along with the developments in the industry, the Three-Dimensional (3D) printer technology, which came to the fore at the end of the 1980s, has started to be used in many areas and has taken an important place in our lives. The prototype of the final version of a product designed with the help of Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs can be easily produced. 3D printers; They are involved in areas such as automotive and machine production in order to develop prototypes in the industry, developing course materials in education, planning of surgical operations in the field of health, production of artificial organs and orthotic prosthesis applications in biomedicine. In this study, 3D printers in the biomedical units in hospitals, the production of new ones instead of the broken parts, and their usage areas are included. In this context, the static analysis of the broken keypad of the ultrasound device was made. Accordingly, the model was created using computer software and the production was carried out with a 3D printer. An example of the usage areas of 3D printers is presented. In addition, the cost of the keypad is reduced by manufacturing it one by one instead of replacing it as a whole.

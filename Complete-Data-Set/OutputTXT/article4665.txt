Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effects of Endothelial Protection Solution on Oxidative Stress in Saphenous Vein Endothelium in Diabetic Patients undergoing Coronary Bypass
Özet: Objective: Saphenous vein grafts used for bypasses of diabetic coronary artery patients are occluded earlier than the normal patient population. In this study, the effects of endothelial protection solution on the protection of saphenous vein grafts taken during the operation against oxidative damage in diabetic patients were investigated.Materials & Methods: The remaining parts of the saphenous vein grafts removed during the operation of 50 diabetic patients who underwent coronary bypass operation in our hospital between 2021 and 2022 were divided into three pieces. Each piece was placed into a different solution as saline (group 1), heparinized autologous blood (group 2), and endothelial protection solution (group 3). They were kept in solutions for 4 hours and then cellular and DNA oxidative stress markers were investigated.Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p>0.05). Total oxidative status (TOS) levels in groups 1 and 2 without endothelial solution (1.57±0.46 vs. 1.55±0.19) were significantly higher than those in group 3 (1.31±0.11) (p<0.05). Moreover, the oxidative stress index (OSI) was significantly lower in group 3 (p<0.05). On the other hand, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, which indicate nuclear oxidative stress, were also found to be low in group 3 (p<0.05).Conclusion: Our results support that the use of endothelial solution on saphenous vein grafts used in diabetic patients prevents oxidative damage.

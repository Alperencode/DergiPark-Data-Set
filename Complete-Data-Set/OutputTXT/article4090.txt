Makale Başlığı: CAHİT ZARİFOĞLU'S SULTAN POETRY AS A MODERN MÜNACAT AND ŞATHİYE DISCOURSE
Özet: One of the first names that comes to mind when it comes to the Islamist poets of modern Turkish literature is undoubtedly Cahit Zarifoğlu. Zarifoğlu, who is a good example in terms of reflecting the poet’s world of belief in his art, also touched on social issues in his poems, but mainly focused on his inner world. In the construction of this internal comparison as a discourse, the poet sometimes expresses the munacat of a calmed soul, and sometimes is kneaded in the agony of regret. Sultan poetry is an example of this munacat and sathiye. The poem is a brief comparison of life that has passed, and a petition of regret for a time wasted as a believer. When the poem, which is a sincere response of the servant with his Lord, is read in terms of expression, it first brings to mind the types of argumentation and sathiye. It is noteworthy that these two genres are used together with the discourse of a modern poet. The fact that a pen like Zarifoğlu wrote a poem in a discourse that would fit these two styles is the most important factor in our handling of the subject.

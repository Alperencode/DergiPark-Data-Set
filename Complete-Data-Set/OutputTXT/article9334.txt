Makale Başlığı: Using the Charlson comorbidity index as a prognostic factor of lower gastrointestinal system bleeding: the experience of a tertiary center
Özet: Introduction: Lesions in the gastroinestinal (GI) tract that are distal to the Treitz ligament are what cause the lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGB) system. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), mortality rates, length of hospital stays, need for intensive care, need for blood products, and surgical rates in patients with acute LGB.Material and Method: Retrospective research was done on patients who had lower GI bleeding and had been seen in our gastroenterology clinic between 2015 and 2021. We looked into the impact of CCI on patients' follow-up after LGB.Results: The mean age of the 210 patients who had lower GI bleeding was 67.70±13.67 years. For all of the patients, the median CCI value was 4.00. (2.00-5.00). While 16 study participants (group 1) passed away, 194 participants (group 2) were released from the hospital. The variance in the median CCI values between the two groups was statistically significant (p>0.001). The results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that CCI was a reliable predictor of mortality (p>0.001).Conclusion: It was found that CCI was an accurate predictor of mortality. CCI ought to be regarded as a crucial factor in the treatment of patients who are bleeding from their lower gastrointestinal tract.

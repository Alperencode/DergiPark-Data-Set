Makale Başlığı: Poverty-Aware Social Work Paradigm: An Assessment Based on the Critical Theory and Anti-Oppressive Approach
Özet: The poverty problem is one of the main focuses of social work profession and discipline. Critical Theory and Anti-Oppressive Approach which are frequently addressed in social work theory and practice have already developed various forms of practice regarding poverty. The harmonization of these forms of practice to the area of poverty with their philosophical (ontological, epistemological, axiological) and practice-based components has been realized through the Poverty-Aware Social Work Paradigm whose main points were determined by an Israeli social work academician Michal Krumer-Nevo. The research on this paradigm in the international literature is seminal but limited. The fact that no studies could be accessed in the social work literature on Poverty-Aware Social Work Paradigm has been a factor for the creation of this study. The purpose of this study is to answer the questions, “What is the approach of Critical Theory and Anti-Oppressive Approach which form the basis of  Poverty-Aware Social Work Paradigm towards the poverty problem?”, “What is the approach of Poverty-aware Social Work Paradigm towards the poverty problem and what are the factors which created this paradigm?”, and “What are the factors which make Poverty-Aware Social Work Paradigm important and original in regards to social work profession and discipline?”. It is believed that this study which deals with the Poverty-Aware Social Work Paradigm in a holistic way is going to contribute to the theory and practice repertoire of social work theory in addition to the national literature.

Makale Başlığı: MacIntyre's Virtue Ethics as a Historicist Interpretation of Rational Moral Tradition
Özet: Alasdair MacIntyre, who does not see tradition as a dead concept but evaluates it as an argument that has expanded historically and socially embodied in terms of methodology, asserts that the rational virtue tradition created by Aristotle, a figure that unites the predecessor and the successor of a very ancient tradition should be revived in order to overcome the moral and socio-political problems of the contemporary world. According to MacIntyre, the consistent and rational basis that moral philosophy has lost due to liberal individualism in a period of about three centuries can be restored by the Aristotelian tradition. This study deals with MacIntyre's analyses of the problems of modern moral philosophy which focus on the view that the tradition in question has an understanding of the teleological human nature and the essence that determines the real purpose of man.

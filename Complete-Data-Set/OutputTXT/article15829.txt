Makale Başlığı: “Story” in Azerbaijani Literature in the 1980’s
Özet: At first glance, the story of the 1980’s in Azerbaijani literature appears to be a continuation of the 1960’s prose. When viewed closely, though, it becomes clear that it has its own peculiarities. During those years, storytellers hoped for a shift in the Soviet government’s oppressive practices. The people who attempted radical improvements in the 1980’s made national and spiritual issues the central theme of the story. It is clear that storytellers in the 1980’s who utilized 1960’s prose as an example in Azerbaijani literature were accused of imitating it and were chastised. In the 1980’s, Azerbaijan’s story genre went through a period of rapid development. Literary generations that differed in age produced works in the same years. The representatives of previous generations,namely İlyas Efendiyev, İsmail Şıhlı, İsa Hüseyinov, Sabir Ehmedli, continued to provide noteworthy examples in the story genre. In reality, Mirza İbrahimov, İsi Melikzade, Anar, Ekrem Eylisli, and Elçin, all of whom symbolize 1960’s prose, attract attention with their successful stories. Similarly, Vagif Nesib, Şahmar Ekberzade, Mövlud Süleymanlı, Ramiz Rövşen, Seyran Sehavet, and Afag Mesut should be highlighted for their outstanding accomplishments in the 1970’s. In 1980’s stories, the individual was emphasized rather than the country’s system being criticized. The story’s heroes, who are trapped in their inner worlds, were depicted as people who are cut off from themselves and society. Alcoholism is introduced into a story. Nepotism and bribery are cited as flaws. Religion and nationality are frequently utilized notions, and the people of Azerbaijan place a high emphasis on both concepts in order to raise their national awareness. It could be stated that the favored locations in 1980’s narratives nearly had their own identity. When compared to the period prior to 1960, the cast of characters, the breadth of subjects, and the preferences of the location underwent radical changes. Written examples, it may be argued, emphasize national issues more, paved the path for the country’s independence, and set the foundation for the Republic of Azerbaijan’s establishment.

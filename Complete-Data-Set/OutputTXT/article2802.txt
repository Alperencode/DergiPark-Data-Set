Makale Başlığı: Change Point Detection Methods for Locating Activations in Functional Neuronal Images
Özet: The most common analysis for fMRI images is activation detection, in which the purpose is to find the locations in the brain that respond to specific functions, such as visual processing or motor functions by providing related stimuli as tasks in the experiment. On the other hand, it is also important to detect the instance the activation is triggered. One of the powerful techniques that can analyze the abnormal behavior of any data is change point (CP) analysis. We suggest that CP detection algorithms also can be used to locate the activations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequences, as well. Our paper presents a two-fold innovative study in that respect. First, we propose to use CP detection algorithms to locate the activations in fMRI signals as a state-of-art topic. Furthermore, we propose and compare a set of change point analysis methods, a regression-based method (RBM), a statistical method (SM), and a mean difference of double sliding windows method (MDSW)) to locate such points. Second, we apply these methods to the fMRI signals, which are acquired from the real subjects, while they were performing fMRI tasks. Proposed methods were applied to three different fMRI experiments with a motor task, a visual task, and a linguistic task. The analysis shows that the methods find activations in accordance with established methods such as statistical parametric maps (SPM). The acquired up to 94 % results also show that the proposed methods can be used effectively to locate the activation times on fMRI time series.

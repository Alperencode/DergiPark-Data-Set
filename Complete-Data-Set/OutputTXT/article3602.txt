Özet: In this study it is aimed to answer the question “does the level of passion in the work of the employees changes over the years?. In this context, 278 employees from different sectors were included in the research. In order to measure the passion level of the participants at work, the Turkish form of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and the level of doing the job with the love of the employees on the first day were measured with a single-item question. The obtained data were subjected to internal consistency tests, analyses to examine differences (Independent Samples T Test, ANOVA) and correlation analysis. According to the research findings, the relationship of participants' passion at work and the level of doing their job with the love of the first day with age, tenure at the current job and tenure (in general) were not significant. Only a weak positive relationship was obtained between age and tenure and the level of absorption dimension of work engagement. In addition, the level of passion for work and the level of doing the job with the love of the first day did not differ in terms of variables such as gender, marital status, employee category (blue and white collar) and education level. Employees who hold managerial positions have a higher level of work engagement than employees who do not have managerial positions. The findings obtained within the scope of the research were discussed and some research suggestions have been made.

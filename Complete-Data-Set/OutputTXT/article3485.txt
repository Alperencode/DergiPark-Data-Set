Makale Başlığı: Relationship between disease severity and prognostic indicators and matrix metallaproteinase in patients with stable idiopatic pulmonary fibrosis
Özet: Purpose: Blood-derived biomarkers have been extensively considered as possible prognostic indicators in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) recently. In order to assess the value of circulating biomarkers in common IPF clinical practice, the study intends to draw conclusions regarding the link between disease severity, prognostic indicators, and serum matrix metalloproteinase in patients with stable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Materials and Methods: The study comprised 22 people with an IPF diagnosis that had been verified by a multidisciplinary approach. The sociodemographic details, clinical and radiologic symptoms, pulmonary function tests and the Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) score were noted. ELISA has been used to research serum MMP concentrations.Results: There is no statistically significant correlation between the Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP 7, MMP 9, and MMP13 and the GAP index and, pulmonary function tests, or disease severity. GAP score was found to be higher in stage 3 in patients with severe disease, in stage 2 in patients with moderate disease, and in stage 1 in patients with mild disease.Conclusion: There are consistent findings in the literature, despite the fact that the association between MMP and IPF prognostic markers, pulmonary function tests, and disease severity could not be seen in this investigation. However, because they could open the door to a cutting-edge treatment strategy, these indicators should be investigated prospectively in larger series.

Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Study of Beak Deformities in Birds
Özet: The aim of this study was to determine the type of lesions in birds referred to the clinic with the complaint of beak deformity, the potential presence of the lesions among the bird species, and the possible causes of the lesions and to report what treatment should be applied. Twenty-six individuals from several bird species with broken and abnormal beak deformities in the beak were presented to our clinics. Different forms of beak deformities were observed, and the causes of some of the lesions were determined as unknown. Beak lesions in wild birds were mostly traumatic fractures, whereas cage birds had parasitic infections and abnormal beak elongation due to nutritional disorders. Treatment protocols appropriate for the region of the beak, severity of the lesion, underlying cause, and type of bird were determined.

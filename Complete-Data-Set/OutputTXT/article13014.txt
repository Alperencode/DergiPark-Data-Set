Makale Başlığı: A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON IDENTIFYING THE IMPACTS OF IRREGULAR MIGRATION ON HOLIDAY DESTINATION
Özet: Irregular migration has become a prominent issue around the world, particularly in Turkey. Irregular migrants, who have an impact on the country’s economy, socio-cultural environment, and many other factors, have also different effects on the tourism industry. This study was conducted using a qualitative method to determine the effects of irregular migration on the holiday destination. Certain questions, within the scope of the study, were asked to 12 participants who have had a holiday in Cesme, Izmir. Responses (audio recordings) were decoded to reveal codes, categories, and themes. Five different themes were identified in this study. According to the findings of this study, it was concluded that irregular migration has negative impacts on the holiday destination. The most frequent coded dimensions are security concerns and anxiety, lack of control and supervision, deterioration in socio-cultural environment, unrest or harassment, and socio-cultural and political conflicts. A number of recommendations were made in line with the results of the study.

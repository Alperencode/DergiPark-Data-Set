Makale Başlığı: The Long Decade of he First TİP Between Syndicalism and Parliamentarianism (1961-1971)
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this article is to focus on the Workers’ Party of Turkey, which for the first time found a place in the institutional politics of the country with its socialist identity in the turbulent years of Turkey in the 1960s.Design/Methodology: With a historicist approach, the first 10 years of the Workers' Party of Turkey (First TİP) were tried to be revealed by taking into account the different understandings within the party and the splits experienced with the important left currents of the period. Purely qualitative methods were used and many primary and secondary sources were searched.Findings: Contrary to traditional parties, TİP, corresponds to an important difference in terms of both its policy execution and party cadres. Although TİP struggled within the system, it is possible to say that it aimed to deviate from the current order of the period with his discourse and programs. In addition, by making it possible to incorporate different left understandings for a long time, it increased the left influence in institutional politics.Limitations: Since each title of the text deserves to be a subject of study on its own, it is an optional and mandatory limitation that some chapters are dealt with in more general terms in line with the purpose of the article.Originality/Value: The originality of the article is that it is handled from an extremely broad perspective in order to enable a general understanding of the first TİP.

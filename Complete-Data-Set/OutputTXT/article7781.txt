Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Microbiological Quality and Public Health Risks of Urban Beaches on the Munzur and Pülümür Streams in Tunceli Province
Özet: The study is aimed to evaluate the microbiological quality of water samples obtained from the beaches of the Munzur and Pülümür streams in Tunceli province, during the summer season of 2019. The samples were analyzed for the fecal indicator bacteria to reveal the bathing water quality of these beaches. The samples were collected from 10 sampling points in the study region between June and September 2019. Fecal streptococci, total coliform, fecal coliform bacteria were determined the highest in August and the lowest in May and July according to the analysis. The data were evaluated according to the bathing water quality directive. The bathing water quality was identified as class B for all the sample points on the beaches. It was found that there was no data exceeded the mandatory value, as per the bathing water directive. This has been applied for the first time for inland waters. Esinti, Halbori, Kavacik, Kutu Stream, and Anahita beaches were found to be most suitable for swimming. According to the results obtained, it was determined that Tunceli city beaches are not polluted in terms of microbial parameters. However, in this study, it is recommended to carry out regular monitoring and evaluation by using appropriate methods to reduce the microbial load in the Munzur Stream and Pülümür Stream basins.

Makale Başlığı: DETERMINING THE GRAIN YIELD AND NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF MAIZE CULTIVARS IN DIFFERENT GROWING GROUPS
Özet: Due to its adaptability to different climates, short growing period, high photosynthetic capacity and yield, maize is an important crop widely grown all over the world. This study was conducted to determine grain yield and some nutrition traits of 18 maize cultivars in Bilecik ecological conditions in 2019 and 2020 years. Experiments were carried out in randomized complete block design with three replications. There were significant (P<0.01) differences between cultivars in terms of grain yield and all quality traits. There were significant differences between years in terms of investigated traits except for potassium, neutral detergent fiber, total phenolic and ash content. According to the two year-average; grain yield, test weight, thousand-grain weight, ash, fat, protein, starch, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber and total phenolic of the maize cultivars were 13.00 ton ha-1, 73.85 kg, 317.76 g, 1.59%, 5.95%, 11.22%, 65.69%, 4.25%, 15.17%, 7.16 mg GA/g whereas condensed tannin, free radical scavenging activity, total flavonoid, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, manganese and copper content were 0.39%, 7.97%, 0.48 mg QE/g, 4.24 g kg-1, 3.58 g kg-1, 1.24 g kg-1, 2.36 g 100g-1, 0.96 g 100g-1, 0.67 g 100g-1 and 0.20 g 100g-1, respectively. According to the Biplot graph, the ADA-9510, SY-Inova, SY-Gladius, Kalideas, Dracma, Kerbanis and Keravnos cultivars were prominent in terms of grain yield while Arifiye, SY-Antex, Kolessaus and Sakarya cultivars were prominent in terms of many quality traits such as PC, FC, AC, TF, TW, ADF, K, P, Mg, Fe, Zn and Mn.

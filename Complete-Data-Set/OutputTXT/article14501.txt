Makale Başlığı: DETERMINING the FACTORS THAT AFFECT the SUCCESS and FAILURE of COMPANIES THROUGH LOGISTIC REGRESSION METHOD: AN APPLICATION on THE BIST 100 INDEX
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the factors that influence financially successful and unsuccessful businesses. As part of the study, financial data of 48 businesses included in the BIST 100 index for the 2001-2019 period were tested by logistic regression analysis. Businesses that were financially successful and financially unsuccessful were determined by the Altman Z-Score model criteria. Based on the price detection reports published in the companies' IPO, independent audited balance sheets and income statements for the pre-IPO periods were used, as well as data for the stock transaction period. The relevant data is accessed through the Public Disclosure Platform, Finnet and İstanbul Stock Exchange. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that the variables that increase the success of the firm are the current ratio, asset turnover, fixed asset turnover and profit before interest and tax / total assets ratio. The variables that decreased operating success were found to be the total leverage ratio, cash conversion duration and return on equity.Keywords: Financial Failure, Borsa İstanbul, Logistic Regression

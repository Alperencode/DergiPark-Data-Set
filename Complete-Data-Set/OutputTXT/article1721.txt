Makale Başlığı: Notes on mangrove civil reservation area, Sagay Marine Reserve, the Philippines: A baseline mangrove diversity checklist
Özet: Sagay Marine Reserve (SMR) being the largest marine reserve in the Philippines is blessed with great biodiversity. However, studies are very limited and there are no published literature in refereed journals for mangroves. This study photo-documented the true mangroves found at the Mangrove Civil Reservation Area (MCRA), a mangrove forest within SMR. A total of 20 species from 12 families were recorded from a series of biodiversity studies, site visits, and species inventory from 2018 to 2021. The list includes Ceriops zippeliana, that has long been mistaken as C. decandra. NONESCOST MCRA showed the highest mangrove diversity compared to other parts of Negros Occidental. Overall, 7 species were new records while 11 previously reported species were not found in this study. This is the first comprehensive species inventory of mangroves found at the reservation area, providing baseline mangrove diversity data with photos.

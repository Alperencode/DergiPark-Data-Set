Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Factors Affecting Chickpea Production Area in Türkiye with ARDL Model
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the factors affecting the chickpea production area. For this purpose, the production amount (tons), the amount of support given to the chickpea product (TL/kg), the price of the chickpea product (TL/kg) were taken as dependent variables. The material of the research is the data set for the period 1991-2020, taking into account the 2003-based price index. According to the results of the research, the most appropriate ARDL model was selected and applied for the data that became stationary at different levels as a result of the stationarity test performed on the data set. According to the results of the analysis, chickpea product price on the chickpea cultivated area was found to be significant at the level of 1%, the amount of support given and the amount of product 5%. According to this result, it was determined that all variables were effective on the cultivated area in chickpea product. In the short term, if there is a deviation from the equilibrium state, there is no movement towards equilibrium again. The fact that more than one variable is effective on the cultivated area and the amount of support given varies with the state policies, making it difficult to return to the balance in case of deviation from the equilibrium state. However, it can be said that the amount of support, which has increased since 2003, has returned to chickpea production and has a positive effect on the production area.

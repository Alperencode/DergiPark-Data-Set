Özet: Dear Researchers,We are happy to publish the June 2022 issue of our journal with its rich content.It is very pleasing to see the positive results of the original publication processescarried out by the devoted editorial team of our journal, whose mission isto contribute to the authors and the field and to add qualifications to academicstudies.We are very sensitive about the compliance of academic writing and scientificstudies with ethical principles. We have included an Ethics Editor in our workteam in order to solve the ethical problems we encounter on this issue moreeffectively and in accordance with ethical principles. We aimed for the EthicsEditor to guide the authors in fulfilling their responsibilities and complyingwith the ethical principles of their work. We hope that the ethical editorial,whose positive results we have seen in the June 2022 issue, will set an examplefor other journals.Among the many studies sent to be published in the June 2022 issue, this issueincludes 26 research articles and 3 book reviews, which have successfullypassed the publication processes and with the final decision of the EditorialBoard. The ranking of the articles was made by considering the scores givenby the Editorial Board during the preliminary review.On behalf of our journal team, I would like to thank all our stakeholders whocontributed to the processes of our journal. See you in the December 2022issue...Assoc. Prof. İsmail BULUTEditor

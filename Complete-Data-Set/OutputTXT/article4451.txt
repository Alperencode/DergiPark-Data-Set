Özet: Free radicals, especially nitric oxide (NO), are of increasing importance in the management of lung diseases. In this study, we aimed to measure the inflammatory parameters with a method that is easy to sample and does not carry any risk to the patient. 37 cases connected to ventilator were included (27 patients, 10 controls). The first day and the third day, expiratory air was removed with an exhaled breath condenser and NO, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were examined. First day; The NO level of the pneumonia group was statistically higher than the control group (p <0,0001). No significant difference was found between the patients in terms of hydrogen peroxide level at the first day (p> 0,05).The decrease in NO level between the first and third days of the pneumonia group was found to be statistically significant. (p<0,05). Serum CRP and exhaled air NO levels were significantly higher in the pneumonia group on the first day compared to the control group, but no difference was found between the H2O2 values. In our study, it is thought that NO is very significant in showing inflammation and may be valuable in early diagnosis, especially in respiratory device-associated pneumonia.

Makale Başlığı: IS IT POSSIBLE NOT TO DISCUSS A TOPIC CONTAINED IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING AGENDA OF A JOINT STOCK COMPANY?
Özet: A joint stock company general assembly convenes and takes resolutions on a certain agenda announced in advance. Thus, the shareholders know from the very beginning what topics will be discussed at the general assembly meeting, and they make preparations accordingly. If a topic not contained in the agenda is desired to be discussed at the general assembly meeting, it is necessary to take the relevant resolution unanimously in order to determine such topic that will be discussed, aside from the exceptions. In practice, there is a problem which is experienced with regard to shareholders in respect to the agenda of a general assembly meeting: Failure to discuss a topic contained in the agenda. So indeed, the failure to discuss a topic contained in the agenda could also adversely affect particularly minority rights. It is also improper to accept that it is possible for the general assembly not to discuss an item contained in the agenda, under a resolution that the general assembly will take by majority. The topics contained in the agenda should be discussed, and affirmative or negative resolutions should be taken about these topics. However, in case of the existence of an essential reason, it should be possible not to discuss a topic contained in the agenda, provided that this reason is recorded in the minutes.

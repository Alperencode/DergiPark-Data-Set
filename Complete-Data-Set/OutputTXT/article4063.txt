Makale Başlığı: Structural and Semantic Parallels Between Diminutive Suffix in Old Turkic +(X)ç and in Turkey Turkish +(X)ş
Özet: It has a very rich additional inventory to add the meaning of diminution to a word in Turkish. The meaning of diminution in these appendixes forms an integrity together with the meanings of love, cuteness and compassion. An appendix with these meanings usually comes to words that express intimacy in terms of close kinship or emotional attachment. As an example of the situation mentioned, it is possible to show the old Turkish +(X)ç diminutive suffix. This study on the idea that the current counterpart of this suffix is  +(X)ş is discussed in the context of historical and current examples.

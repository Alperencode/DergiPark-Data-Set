Makale Başlığı: RECYCLED BRICKS AND TILES IN SUSTAINABLE DESIGN RECONVERSION IN ARCHITECTURAL APPLICATION
Özet: Since the Upper Paleolithic Age, the soil has always been important in line with the needs of human beings to cultivate, create a living space, and produce utensils such as pots, crockery, and pottery. As in every field, it has continued its development in the production process of soil material, by transferring its culture to the next from each civilization throughout the ages. Suitable for mass production as well as traditional production in the field of ceramics, clay is used in a wide area today by undergoing various processes with new technologies. Bricks and tiles, which have not lost their importance in industrialization, especially in architectural structures, are decontextualized and changed by some designers and architects who have sustainability concerns. Instead of using new materials in contemporary architectural projects, waste materials of old buildings can be recombined with the main structure and integrated with an appropriate design language, with original and modern pursuits without breaking with the traditional. Generally, the basis of combining the old material with the new is the concern of displaying a prudent, environmentalist approach bearing the traces of the past. The scope of this qualitative research consists of establishing a spatial and conceptual connection with modern architectural structures, making the waste building materials sustainable without breaking away from the local, and recycling the wastes by reinterpreting them with an artistic point of view. Sustainability makes positive contributions to society when considered by establishing an aesthetic and cultural bond. Within function-form-art-aesthetics and socio-cultural context, making the materials in old buildings an element of the modern structure in a contemporary style and the implementation of projects that can be called architectural sculpture are conveyed with examples in the research content.

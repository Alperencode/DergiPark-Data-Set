Makale Başlığı: Numerical Investigation of the Effects of Plate Diffusers in Central Air Handling Units on Flow Field and Pressure Drop
Özet: The cross-sectional area of the blowing nozzles of various fans in the central ventilation and air conditioning plants, after the fan in the plant, silencer, heating / cooling units, mixing room, heat recovery units or filter, etc. is considerably smaller than the cross-sectional area of the cells. In order for the air handling unit to operate more effectively, the air leaving the fan must be spread to the subsequent cells with the least possible pressure drop and the most homogeneous velocity distribution. Empty cells with a perforated diffuser are used to spread the air exiting the blower of the fan to a larger cross-sectional area. In this study, the case of empty cells with diffusers with perforated plates was investigated. The holes geometries were designed as triangle and hexagon and respectively, single plate, double plate placed back to back and triple plate were determined. The holes of the plates placed one behind the other are arranged asymmetrically. The designed perforated plate diffusers were tested at three different velocities as 5 m/s, 10 m/s and 15 m/s, and the diffusers were placed in the area where the contraction ended. For the installed diffusers, the flow distribution of the air in the empty cell and the pressure drop caused by the empty cell with a perforated diffuser were numerically investigated. As a result of the study, the lowest pressure drop was achieved in a single hexagonal perforated flat plate diffuser at flow velocity of 5 m/s. The highest pressure drop was obtained in a triple triangular perforated flat plate diffuser at flow velocity of 15 m/s. The most favorable situation in terms of homogeneous velocity distribution occurred in the double hexagonal perforated flat plate diffuser at flow velocity of 15 m/s, and the most unfavorable situation occurred in the triple triangular perforated flat plate diffuser at flow velocity of 15 m/s.

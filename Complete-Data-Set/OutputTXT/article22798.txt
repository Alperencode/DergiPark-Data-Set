Makale Başlığı: Military Naval and Air Vehicles Defecting to Turkey during the World War II
Özet: The World War II gained a more brutal dimension than the First World War in terms of military equipment. Military vehicles such as combat aircraft, capable of large-scale bombardment, ships, submarines, and tanks affected the extent of the war. Military forces belonging to countries at war could take refuge in countries outside the war with their land, air and sea vehicles as a result of a pursuit or oppression. That situation could be legal, illegal or compulsory. Therefore, Turkey, which was seen as a safe harbour due to its characteristic features and geopolitical location, had its share of those asylums. Young Turkey, despite its limited financial condition, did not hesitate to open its doors to refugees. In the aforementioned period, in addition to military and civilian refugees, war vehicles belonging to foreign air and naval forces also defected in Turkey.In this study, asylum in Turkey of naval and air vehicles belonging to belligerent states during World War II and Turkey's internment practices were examined.

Makale Başlığı: Class Conflict over Slum and Apartment Opposition: Acı Hayat Movie Example
Özet: Class relations, whose beginning and end points are uncertain, cannot be separated from each other with certain lines. Karl Marx and Max Weber have made prominent studies on class. Classes, which are the most basic social forces of societies, experience conflicts among themselves for many different reasons. Class conflicts are a fundamental building block of Marxist theory. Class conflicts have become even more visible in the competitive environment of capitalism. Slums and apartments are reflections of class conflicts on space. While individuals from the lower classes live in the slums, wealthy people from the upper classes live in the apartment blocks. Turkish cinema has not remained indifferent to the subject of slums and apartments. The movie Acı Hayat, in which class conflicts are told through slums and apartments, contains rich data in terms of examining class conflicts.

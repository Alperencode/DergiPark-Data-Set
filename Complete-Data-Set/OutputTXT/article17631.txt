Makale Başlığı: AN ANALYSIS OF IAN MCEWANS’ NOVEL “THE CHILDREN ACT” ACCORDING TO MINORS' RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT
Özet: The connection between literature and law goes back much further, although literature and legal studies have become more crucial recently in Turkish legal studies. Especially in terms of literature, it can be said that law and literature have always been in a close relationship. Because when we look at the history of literature, in many classical books, various legal problems and the consequences of these problems are discussed through the lives of individuals (in other words, characters). Just as literature deals with law, it is fundamental for a lawyer to have an interest in literature since literature has the feature of making "inanimate texts" (norms) "alive". Thanks to the literature, a lawyer is encouraged to ponder on the purpose, meaning and consequences of the norms. Based on this thought, this paper will analyse Ian McEwan's novel The Child Law from a legal point of view. The focus of the novel is the refusal of a seventeen-year-old Jehovah's Witness boy living in England to receive a blood transfusion and treatment because of his faith. This paper will discuss minors’ right to refuse medical treatment in the context of Turkish law and English law while analysing the novel.

Makale Başlığı: Ontological Security and Iran’s Missile Program
Özet: This article attempts to answer the question of why Iran is reluctant to discuss itsmissile program. Unlike other studies that focus on the importance of Iran’s missileprogram in providing deterrence for the country and establishing a balance ofmilitary power in the region, or that view the missile program as one of dozensof post-revolutionary contentious issues between Iran and the United States, thisarticle looks into Iran’s ontological security. The paper primarily argues that themissile program has become a source of pride for Iranians, inextricably linkedto their identity. As a result, the Iranian authorities face two challenges when itcomes to sitting at the negotiation table with their Western counterparts: deepmistrust of the West, and the ensuing sense of shame over any deal on the missileissue. Thus, Iranian officials opted to preserve the identity components of theprogram, return to normal and daily routines of life, insist on the missile program’scontinuation despite sanctions and threats, and emphasize the dignity and honorof having a missile program. The article empirically demonstrates how statescan overcome feelings of shame and mistrust. It also theoretically proves thatwhen physical security conflicts with ontological security, governments prefer theformer over the latter, based on the history of Iran’s nuclear negotiations. Theyappeal to create new narratives to justify changing their previous policies.

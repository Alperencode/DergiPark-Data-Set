The descriptive statistics, independent samples t test, One Way ANOVA, post-hoc tests, Correlation analysis and Cronbach's Alpha reliability analysis test were used to assess the data. In the study, it was found that the intensive care patients mostly used the affiliative and aggressive humor style and they had a positive intensive care experience.  Additionally, there were a positive significant weak correlation between the affiliative humor and the subscale of “satisfaction with care” of ICEQ and a negative significant weak correlation between the subscales of “frightening experiences” and “recall of experience”.

Makale Başlığı: Epigenetic Perspective in Schizophrenia: DNA Methylation Patterns
Özet: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations and various behavioral disorders.  Affecting approximately 1% of the world's population, schizophrenia not only affects patients, but also other members of the society. Genetic and environmental factors play roles in the etiology of the disorder.Genetics, neurodevelopmental disorder, drug use, urban life, alone or together can be counted as the factors that cause the disorder. Despite increasing studies in recent years, the factors causing the formation of schizophrenia have not been fully clarified and more research is needed. Although genetic factors are risk factors for schizophrenia, it is thought that some environmental factors affect the emergence of the disorder. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene functions without changing the nucleotide sequence of DNA. DNA methylation is associated with schizophrenia, and methylation status studies have been conducted in many schizophrenia candidate genes. Examination of DNA methylation states will contribute significantly to psychiatric research.In this review, data published in global databases obtained from DNA methylation studies related with schizophrenia are summarized and their importance in schizophrenia is briefly discussed.

Makale Başlığı: COMPANIES WITH VISIONARY LEADERS POSITIONED FOR FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY: SIX CASE STUDIES OF BENCHMARKS FOR SURVIVAL
Özet: This paper is an attempt at unraveling some of the enduring characteristics that have catapulted six successful businesses to the orbits they have reached. Case studies outlining the vision, strategies, and implementation policies are useful because they provide a roadmap for others to follow. This paper will explore how they actualized their mission from their inception and over the last year during the Covid crisis. The case studies are as follows: Alfapac AB, Zoom, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent, and Netflix. The research shows that the companies selected used the contravening forces to pivot back to their original organizational vision, mission and core values.

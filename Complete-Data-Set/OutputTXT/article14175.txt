Makale Başlığı: QUALITY OF LIFE OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER ACCORDING TO MOTHERS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY
Özet: This study, which aimed to examine the quality of life (QOL) of hospitalized children with cancer between the ages of two and seven according to the views of their mothers, has a qualitative phenomenology design. The study group included the mothers of 10-children who were hospitalized in the oncology department of two university hospitals in Ankara, diagnosed with cancer at least 6-months ago, and had no major physical and motor developmental disorders. The data were collected with "General Information Form" and "Mother Interview Form", and analyzed with content and descriptive analysis methods. Most of the mothers stated that their children had physical problems and experienced negative emotional changes during the diagnosis and treatment process. Mothers also stated that their children's social, emotional, language, and gross motor development were adversely affected, they had physical and communication problems, their playing experiences had changed, and their QOL had been affected. In addition, they stated that they met with a child development specialist during the diagnosis and treatment process which was a satisfying service. In line with these considerations, results were obtained regarding the physical, developmental, and communication problems, emotional and QOL changes experienced by children with cancer, and experiences with child development professionals.

Makale Başlığı: War, Fiscal Crisis, and the Imperial Mint: Financing Military Expenses in the second half of the 18th Century
Özet: One of the most troubled periods in Ottoman history began in 1774, after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The Ottoman treasury was crushed by the cost of the war that ended and even worse, it had to deal with great difficulties in preparing for future wars. During this period when the financial crisis was at its peak, the biggest supporter of the treasury was the Imperial Mint. The events following Sultan Mustafa’s enthronement transformed the Imperial Mint into a reserve treasury. The Imperial Mint mobilized its revenues to cover the expenses of the army and the navy. Among these revenues, the total amount of the fund of unfixed revenues (zuhurat akçesi) and the campaign fund (seferiye akçesi) only exceeded 88 million guruş in this period (between 1766 and 1794). The income generated by the debasement of the coins in circulation was not included in this amount. This study focuses on the ways in which the revenues set aside as the reserve fund were used to meet the military expenditures.

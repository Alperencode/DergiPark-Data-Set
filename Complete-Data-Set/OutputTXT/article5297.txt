Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Global Warming on International Incompetence in the Arctic Region
Özet: In this study, "What are the conflicts of the regional states in terms of international law in the Arctic and what effect will global warming have on these disagreements?" Regarding the question, the data obtained by the documentary scanning method from various sources dealing with the effects of global warming in the Arctic region and disagreements based on international law were analyzed. As a result of this process, in response to the research question, "As a result of the current and potential effects of global warming, in the context of gaining weight in national policies and facilitating access to energy resources, the disagreements between the states of the region in terms of international law in the Arctic will deepen." The hypothesis put forward was confirmed. Thus, it has been found that the Arctic will gain more importance as the glaciers melt, becoming more accessible, and as a result, states will be more reluctant to resolve conflicts in the region and that the struggle against disagreements carries the risk of turning into a political and military struggle by moving out of the legal ground.

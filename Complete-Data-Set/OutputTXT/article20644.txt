Makale Başlığı: The Importance and Place of the Book of Sa‘leb Named Al-Faṣîḥ in Laḥn and Taṣḥîḥ Literature
Özet: The encounter of different non-Arab nations and cultures with Arabs due to conquest and translation activities contributed to the development of Arabic language rules and caused erroneous readings in recitation and expression problems in hadiths and the deterioration of the Arabic language from different perspectives. Against this, some precautions were taken for the preservation of classical Arabic, such as the development of writing, the determination of grammar rules, the support of poets and lexicon studies. One of the measures taken is to set standards for classical language and to draw attention to the uses that do not comply with these standards. Since the middle of the II/VII century, many works have been written in different content and style on language mistakes made in speeches and written texts, with subject headings such as "Laḥnü'l-ʻâmme, Mâ telḥanu fîhiʼl-ʻâmme, laḥnü'l-ʻavâm, laḥnü'l-havâṣ". These works not only contribute to the preservation of the language, but also provide the opportunity to monitor the changes in the words and expressions used in the period they were written. In this context, one of the written works is Ebü'l-Abbâs Sa'leb's language book called Kitâbü'l-Faṣîḥ. Although the work in question has many merits, the most important aspect is the determination of the language spoken among the people in the work and the presentation of the most eloquent one to the reader. The work has gained an important place in the field of laḥn and taṣḥîḥ literature with its rich vocabulary, rich and useful materials for dictionary and dictionary studies, and being a source for many works in the field. The work, which attracted great attention by scholars, has been handled with studies such as şerḥ, ḥâşiye, naḳd, zeyl, iḫtisâr and nazm at different times and in different scientific environments, and is accepted as one of the important works in the field.

Makale Başlığı: The Flora of Koz Mountain (Genç/Bingöl) and its Surroundings
Özet: The flora of Mount Koz (Genç-Bingöl) and its surroundings was studied between 2019-2021. As a result of the identification of 1506 specimens collected from the area, 625 taxa (415 species, 147 subspecies, and 63 varieties) belonging to 289 genera and 68 families were identified. Two taxa of the determined plants are members of Pteridophyta and 623 taxa are members of Spermatophyta. of the Spermatophyta members, 621 taxa belong to Angiospermae and two taxa to Gymnospermae subdivisions. of the Angiospermae members, 498 taxa are in the Dicotyledones and 123 taxa Monocotyledones classes. 49 taxa of the plants identified in the study are endemic and the endemism rate is 7.84%. The phytogeographical region element distributions of the determined taxa are as follows: Irano-Turanian 192 (30.72%), Mediterranean 60 (9.60%), Euro-Siberian 49 (7.84%), and multi-regional or unknown phytogeographical region 324 (51.84%). The order of the first 10 families with the highest taxa number is as follows: Asteraceae (85), Poaceae (65), Fabaceae (52), Caryophyllaceae (38), Lamiaceae (38), Brassicaceae (34), Boraginaceae (29), Apiaceae (23), Rosaceae (20), and Plantaginaceae (13). The top 10 largest genera are respectively designated as Trifolium (14), Astragalus (13), Centaurea (11), Allium (10), Vicia (8), Galium (8), Ranunculus (8), Bromus (8), Veronica (8), and Silene (7). Life form evaluation of the determined taxa is as follows: 285 (45.60%) are hemicryptophytes, 178 (28.48%) therophytes, 83 (13.28%) cryptophytes, 37 (5.92%) chamaephytes, and 42 (6.72%) phanerophytes.

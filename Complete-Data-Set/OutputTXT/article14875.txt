Makale Başlığı: Cad Systems Used in Weaving Design
Özet: Industry 4, which is accepted as the fourth industrial revolution, is based on the traditional design and production approach, where big data is processed, e-commerce networks are established, physical and virtual environments are brought together, energy reaches sustainable-renewable features, 3D printing technologies are developed, and even production orders can be given over the network. It is a process of great change in which many new approaches are introduced. CAD software, which brings innovation and convenience to the textile industry, as it does in all areas, accelerates the design and production process and ensures error-free realization, are important systems in this change process. Apart from common software that is easier to access and is used in many areas, there are many software that vary in license fees within the possibilities it offers. Manufacturers produce the software in accordance with CAM systems and become a partner in the competition with innovations that improve their features every day. Since the textile industry has a great diversity in terms of products and production, software for that product is used in every production type. Weavings produced with dobby and jacquard systems also have an important place in this large spectrum. Therefore, in this study, the CAD software used in weaving design were included in the scope of the subject, and the innovations and opportunities that each of them brought to the field were evaluated.

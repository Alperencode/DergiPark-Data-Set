Makale Başlığı: A Review on Mental Illness and Stigma
Özet: The concept of stigma is a universal problem that has been the subject of many studies. The phenomenon of stigmatization in psychiatric disorders is also an issue that should be particularly emphasized. Studies have reported that the diagnostic groups most exposed to stigmatization are psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. The stigma process is shaped especially by the clinical features of psychiatric disorders and the society’s attributions to the causes of psychiatric disorders. IIn order for interventions to be developed to prevent stigmatization to be effective, the causes of stigmatization must first be understood.. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to review the stigmatization processes separately according to the types of psychiatric disorders.

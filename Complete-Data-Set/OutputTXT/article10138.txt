Makale Başlığı: A GRAIN CENTRE ON THE COAST OF THE DANUBE RIVER IN THE 18TH CENTURY: ISACCEA WAREHOUSES
Özet: The grain bought by the Ottoman traders from the fertile lands on the banks of the Danube and Wallachia and Moldovia was stored in the warehouses of Isaccea in case of need. Grain could be loaded easily on ships from Isaccea, which was located in the easiest part of the Danube to cross. This feature of Isaccea enabled the construction of many warehouses near the pier. During the 18th century in Isaccea, construction activities continued for warehouses which were damaged, needed to be rebuilt, or were inadequate for grain storage. This construction activity was an economic resource for many people in the region and necessitated an intense organization. This study provides information on the warehouse construction activities in Isaccea in the 18th century and focuses on the shipping of the grain stocked here to the Black Sea castles on the border, especially those under Russian threat. Thus, the study emphasizes that the State was making intense efforts to ensure that the soldiers protecting the borders did not suffer in terms of subsistence.

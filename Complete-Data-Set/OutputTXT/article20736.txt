Özet: The main purpose of this paper is to discuss and evaluate the problem of elderly discrimination, which has been deepened due to the measures taken during the Covid-19 epidemic in Turkey. In this process, the consequences of measures  taken  for  the  elderly  people  are  searched  whether  they  are  adequate  or  not  in  meeting  the  needs  of elderly individuals and whether these measures led to any problems for elders or not. In order to achieve this aim, firstly,  a  general  introduction  related  to  the  epidemic  and  its effects  was  made.  Then,  the  issue  of  age discrimination, especially for the elders, was evaluated and discussed. Thirdly, the data collected from the field were analyzed and discussed. This study can be accepted as a qualitative one. In other words, the data of study were collected by semi-structured interviews done with individuals aged 65 and over living in the Çankaya and Mamak districts of Ankara. In addition, the socio-demographic variables of the elders were also gathered. The data obtained were classified and analyzed, and the main questions of the study were tried to be answered. At the end of the study, it was concluded that although the elderly individuals were restricted from going out within the framework  of  health  measures  in  a  good  faith,  violations  of  their  rights  and  psycho-social  problems  were significantly experienced and discriminatory attitudes and discourses increased in the period of Covid-19.

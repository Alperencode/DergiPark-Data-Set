Makale Başlığı: An unusual cause of acute abdomen in children: Mesenteric pseudocyst in the ileum
Özet: Intraabdominal cysts and pseudocysts are unusual lesions. Mesenteric cysts in the pediatric age group are more common in boys [62.5%] and most cases are under 10 years of age. Mesenteric cysts are often asymptomatic. Mesenteric cysts rarely recur after removal and patients have a good prognosis. The most common surgical procedure in treatment is excision during laparotomy. We present the surgical method that we apply to the unusual case of ileum mesenteric cyst, which constitutes the clinical picture of the acute abdomen in an 11 years old boy, in the light of the literature.

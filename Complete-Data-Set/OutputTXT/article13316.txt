Makale Başlığı: Respect for Religious and Spiritual Values in Ottoman Fatwa Literature
Özet: Historical sources state that the Ottoman Empire built a society model in which people of different religions, languages, races and cultures could live in peace and harmony by keeping them under one roof. Undoubtedly, Islamic culture and civilization has an especially important role in the development of this experience of living together. In accordance with the Islamic state tradition, the society has been classified based on religion, and in this direction freedom of religion and belief has been adopted as a basic principle. However, it was expected from all segments of the society to be respectful towards religious and sacred values in order to avoid the conflict of culture and civilization. In this article, the legal regulations of the Ottoman period, which are about respect for religious and spiritual values, will be pointed out with examples from the fatwa literature, which constitutes a unique form of these regulations shaped in line with the practical needs of the society. In this context, fatwas emphasizing the freedom of religion and worship, regulating the belief principles of religion, respecting its symbolic provisions, and the values that it considers sacred, will be included. In addition, it will be determined that the issue of elfâz-ı kufr, which is mostly related to the act of apostasy (irtidad) in the doctrine, is seen as a sanction element aimed at preventing the corruption of religious values in many fatwas. Beyond that, fatwas for the protection of the religious and spiritual values of the minority elements formed by non-Muslims will also be discussed, and in this context, examples of fatwas that guarantee the freedom of religion and worship of non-Muslims and prevent them from being deprived of education and social rights will be included.

Makale Başlığı: AS A FAITH AESTHETICS "HINDUISM": POLITICAL AESTHETIZATION AND PSYCHOLOGY
Özet: Aesthetics is the essence of psychological codes. In this article, aesthetics and aestheticization concepts are used to explain psychological phenomena. Psychological aestheticizations with inclusive values (religion, politics, economics, moral values, etc.) used to describe the psychological states of a system are based on the assumption of the existence of a mutual relationship. Not all psychological outputs occur without reference to the system in which they are found. The Foundation of the existence of psychological values is the expression of individual aestheticizations. Psychological thinking, emotion, and behavioral structures such as transformation, adaptation, integration are adapted to the prevailing structures and legitimize themselves. Especially in the countries where all life is full of sanctity, the psychology of self-positioning in sanctity is made possible with aestheticizations of the great values of sanctity. Therefore, this study discusses the relationship between faith aesthetics and the presence of psycho-pathological disorders. Qualitative research methodology, review of the literature, and text analysis were used in the study.

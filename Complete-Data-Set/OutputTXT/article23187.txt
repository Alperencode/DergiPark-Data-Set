Makale Başlığı: “DECOMMISSIONING” – “İŞLETMEDEN ÇIKARMA” CONCEPT AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Özet: Decommissioning of nuclear power plants is not new for the rest of the world but for our country. It is a combination of a long-term project (approximately 20 years), public order and the management of high-level hazardous risks. Indeed, the planning of dismantling, decontamination and disposal of nuclear waste requires serious attention of both the operator and the regulatory authorities. Nuclear reactors are subjected to a set of treatments phase by phase. First, reducing the volume of radiation on used nuclear fuels, waste materials and concrete then the discharge of the waste fuels, later on, the actual dismantling of the construction followed by the transport and storage of the fuel waste at a radioactive disposal facility. There is public order and regulatory supervision in all phases from the plant to the said facilities until the removal of the regulatory control. The ultimate purpose of decommissioning is to return the facilities to “green field” status by using different technics and plans. Funding is yet another essential issue of decommissioning. The procedures for an average commercial nuclear reactor can cost up to a billion US dollars including the dismantling, labour and the waste management involving various other sectors through subcontractors. Such a vital issue regarding the environment and the society, by no mistake was overlooked so far and processed only little with relevant regulations. Here now, right on time, it is recommended in this work to the competent authorities to take the necessary legal steps for the certain loopholes.

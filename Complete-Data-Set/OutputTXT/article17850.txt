Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Foliar Fertilizers on Yield and Quality of Sugar Beet
Özet: In this study, which was carried out in the 2016/2017 sugar beet production season in Burdur, it was aimed to determine the effects of foliar fertilizers on the yield and quality of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris var. saccharifera).  In the research, 8 different foliar fertilizers were used, including Aminofol, Batguano, Borzinc, Comozink, Flora-X, Foton, Humatex-SF, Liquid vermicompost, which are recommended for sugar beet agriculture. Biological yield, leaf yield, root yield, polar sugar ratio and polar sugar yield were found to be statistically significant in the properties examined in the study.  The highest leaf yield (1055.7 kg/da), root yield (6947.0 kg/da), biological yield (7896.3 kg/da) and polar sugar yield (1248.0 kg/da) were obtained when Photon foliar fertilizer was applied. Polar sugar ratio was highest in Foton (17.96%) and Flora-X (17.81%) foliar fertilizer applications. The other foliar fertilizers used also contributed positively to the yield at different rates. It was concluded that these studies should be carried out in different locations for many years in order to reach a definite result

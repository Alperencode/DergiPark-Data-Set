Makale Başlığı: From the Early Iron Age (IX-VI century B.C.) Phoenician Colonization Movements in the Mediterranean
Özet: The Phoenician coast was one of the most important centers of the Bronze Age, as it was the linking place of sea and land trade. In the XIIth century B.C. the migration of the Sea Peoples led to the collapse of large states and accelerated the rise once again of city-states. From the IXth century B.C., the Phoenicians consolidated their position in the east, due to the city-state of Tyre gaining privileges from regional trade; furthermore, this was also the main factor behind the colonization movements in the Western Mediterranean. Colonists united by the city of Tyre founded settlements that crossed over to the other side of the Straits of Gibraltar. Compared to the Hellenic settlements the Phoenician colonies were small settlements, with no intention to expand on land. The Phoenicians wanted to earn more revenue and settled in strategic points where valuable mines were located around the Western Mediterranean. Instead of expansionist colonization, they played an intermediary role between the local societies and the east. Phoenicians played a part in the formation of the mixed structure of both Eastern and Western Mediterranean cultures. Trade profits and colonization era improved by the privileges continued to be eastern centered until the city of Tyre was captured by the Persians. To better understand Phoenician colonization a few Phoenician finds and the narratives of Hellenic authors are used. This article aims to reveal the reasons, operations, and results of Phoenician colonization.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of The Seasons on The Variation of Arsenic, Boron, and Other Parameters in The Waters in Igdir
Özet: In this study, we investigated and determined the amount of various toxic elements like manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), boron (B), and arsenic (As) in underground drilling and surface natural springs drinking waters in Iğdır province and districts Ararat Mountain side by the ICP- MS technique in dry and rainy months. The several properties of samples of drinking water, such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), salinity (Sal), Cl‾, NH4+, and NO3‾ were measured with the mobile YSI Professional Plus multiparameter. The results of the analysis were compared to the limit values of the World Health Organization (WHO), the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the European Union Standard (Council of the European Union Standards: ECS), and the National Drinking Water Standard (TSE). The mass amount of toxic elements of Mn, Co, Ni, B, and As in the analysis regions for volcanic rocks near water samples was detected to be 357 mg kg-1, 16.5 mg kg-1, 22.4 mg. kg -1, 5 mg kg-1, and 3.8 mg kg-1, respectively. The maximum concentration of Mn, Co, Ni, As, and B toxic elements in drinking water in the study area was detected in September 2017 in the dry season as 417.88 μg.L-1, 0.35 μg.L-1, 3.06 μg L-1, 37.16 μg.L-1, and 1185.45 μg L-1, respectively; and in May 2017 and June 2017, in the rainy season as 133.67 μg L-1, 0.45 μg L-1, 2.26 μg L-1, 50.98 μg L-1, and 1075.61 μg L-1, respectively. In the analysis sample of drinking water in September 2017, one of the dry months, the variation in the average of the Mn, Co, Ni, As, and B toxic elements decreased compared to December 2017, March 2017, and June 2017. Depending on the water quality parameters, a significant amount of positive effect among EC, Log [TDS], and Log [Cl−] parabolically were determined and calculated as R2=0.906. As a result, in this study, we revealed that the toxic element amount varies considerably depending on the seasons of the year.

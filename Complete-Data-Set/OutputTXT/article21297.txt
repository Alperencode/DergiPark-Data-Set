Özet: In this research, it is aimed to determine the opinions of school stakeholders on the strengths and weaknesses of the mid-term break, which was implemented for the first time in November 2019 in the Turkish National Education System. The study group of the research, in which the basic qualitative research design was adopted, consists of twenty-nine participants. In the research, the data were collected in face-to-face interviews through a semi-structured interview form. The obtained data were analyzed by content analysis. According to the findings of the research, the strengths of the mid-term break are that it allows students to overcome their academic deficiencies, participate in social-cultural-sportive activities, and develop a positive attitude towards school; contributes to teachers' professional and personal development and establishing positive workplace friendships; provides an opportunity to facilitate parents' daily lives and strengthen family relationships. In addition, breaks have strengths such as supporting a positive organizational climate and organizational learning for schools which are organizations. However, the mid-term break has weaknesses as it causes loss of learning and motivation, creates inequality of opportunity for students; implementation of an inefficient seminar and activity program for teachers due to the inadequacy of planning; for parents, inequality of opportunity because of some disadvantages.

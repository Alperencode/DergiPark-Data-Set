Makale Başlığı: How To Write a Good Qualitative Evidence Synthesis?
Özet: A good qualitative review is an invaluable resource, synthesizing and presenting all available evidence for the interesting phenomenon and research question. Systematic reviews are considered the gold standard because of a comprehensive literature review and lower author bias. In recent years, with the increasing awareness of the power of qualitative research to influence policy and practice, the need for qualitative evidence syntheses, also known as systematic reviews of qualitative research, has begun to be felt more. Although qualitative evidence syntheses are strong in terms of evidence, they increase the risk of bias when the research method is not properly designed and reported. Qualitative evidence syntheses differ methodologically from traditional systematic reviews. In this article, information about writing a good qualitative evidence synthesis is shared in line with the literature.

Makale Başlığı: Change of B and Ag concentrations due to traffic density in some plants growing in Samsun city center
Özet: Increasing population and industrialization have brought air pollution, air pollution has increased to a level that threatens human health in some cities and has become one of the most important agenda topics of today. In the city, many pollutants arise from exhaust gases, car wheels, vehicles, and vehicle wear. Because heavy metals can remain in nature for a long time without deterioration and their concentration in the environment is constantly increasing. Therefore, the determination of heavy metal concentration is of great importance in terms of determining the risky areas and risk level. Biomonitors are the most important indicators that show the change in the concentration of heavy metal pollution in the atmosphere. In this study, it was tried to determine the changes in the concentrations of B and Ag elements based on organ washing and traffic density in Euonymus japonica (Ej), Juniperus sabina (Js), and Buxus sempervirens (Bs), which can be used to monitor traffic-induced heavy metal concentration. Leaf and branch samples were collected from the individuals of the plant species that are the subject of the study, grown in areas with heavy traffic, low density, and no traffic, washing process was carried out in some of the samples, and heavy metal analyzes were made in the prepared samples, and the concentrations of B and Ag elements were determined. It was determined that different species accumulate heavy metals at different levels, and the changes in the concentrations of the elements vary depending on the organ and traffic density on the species basis.

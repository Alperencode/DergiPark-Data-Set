Özet: Maritime transport is an important part of the supply chain network and logistics services in international trade. As a result of the negative situation in the economy and trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the maritime freight transport market was also affected. In this context, the aim of the research is to evaluate the factors that affect the general operation of ship chartering and brokerage activities and company performance due to Covid-19. In the study, a survey was applied to 141 brokers by convenience sampling method. Data were gathered between 27 January and 30 July 2021. Correlation and regression analysis were conducted by using the IBM SPSS 22 program to evaluate the questionnaires. According to the results obtained, it is seen that the variable with the highest relationship on the general operation of chartering and brokerage activities is the freight market (p=0.000, r= 0.477), and the second variable is the psycho-social status of the brokers (p=0.000, r= 0.445). It is seen that the variable with the highest relationship on the profitability level of the charter and brokerage businesses is the freight market (p=0.000, r= 0.366), and the second variable is the ship and voyage planning (p=0.000, r= 0.342).

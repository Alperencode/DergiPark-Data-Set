Makale Başlığı: Current Understanding of Pathogenesis, Histopathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options of Uterine Fibroids-Review
Özet: Uterine fibroids are the most common benign monoclonal tumors of the uterus..They are associated with a significant morbidity rate and affect women mainly during their reproductive age. These tumors are usually asymptomatic however, they may present as heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, abnormal uterine bleeding, consequent anaemia, pelvic pain, infertility, and/or recurrent abortions. Despite many factors playing a role in the development and incidence of these common tumors namely; modifications in growth factor expression, abnormalities in the vascular system, and tissue reaction to injury and even genetics, a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids is yet to be achieved. However, there has been significant progress made towards understanding their origin witnessed in recent years which has provided more options for the treatment of uterine fibroids including medical, surgical, and radiological interventions. This article briefly reviews the current knowledge of pathology, histology, and diagnosis of uterine fibroids while highlighting their treatment options.

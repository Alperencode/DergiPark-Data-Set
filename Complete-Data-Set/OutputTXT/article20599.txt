Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the possibilities of using sanding powder in MDF production
Özet: The sanding powder that is released every day is at least 25 tons in Divapan A.Ş. This sanding powder is generally destroyed by burning in energy production in the factory. Re-introducing the sanding powder will contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. Utilization of factory wastes by creating a new usage area through recycling can play an important role in reducing environmental problems and protecting raw material sources. In this study, 10 mm thickness MDF boards were produced from sanding powder. It is aimed to bring sanding powder to the industry. Approximately 750 tons of sanding powder released per month can be used in fiberboard production. Fiberboard was produced by mixing wood fibers and MDF sanding powders in certain proportions. Then, some technological properties of the test samples were examined. When the MDF powder ratio increased, the thickness swelling decreased. On the other hand, it was observed that there was a decrease in bending strength after 20% of MDF powder. As a result, it has been determined that it is possible to evaluate sanding powder in MDF production. MDF panels have been examined suitability related standards.

The plant species consumed as food may vary from country to country, from region to region and even from province to province. Herb dishes are among the indispensables of Turkish cuisine as well as Mediterranean cuisine. Herb species that are widely used as food in Kahramanmaras cuisine are; Cricket (E. spectabilis), Purslane (P. oleracea), Snake pillow (A. maculatum), Sorrel (R. acetosella), Isp (R. ribes), Mallow (M. neglecta), Nettle (U. dioica), Mustard oleracis (S. arvensis), Wild chard (B. vulgaris), Thyme (T. spyleus), White goosefoot (C. album), Basil (O. basilicum) and Genuine daisy (M. chamomilla). Condiment, spices, and coffee are made from some of the common trees in Kahramanmaras.

Makale Başlığı: Orhan Kemal’s Novel Murtaza in terms of Persona (Mask) Archetype
Özet: The concept of  “archetype”, which was introduced to the world of psychology by Carl Gustav Jung, expresses the behavior patterns transferred from past to present. Jung used this concept to explain human behavior. One of the archetypes is the persona (mask) archetype. The persona, which represents the social aspect of the personality, is the identity that the person acquires according to how he wants to look in social life. People need to be accepted by society and therefore keep up with the general behavior patterns of society by developing various personas. Although the persona shows a personal characteristic, it is actually a collective structure. If a person’s persona develops more than his other personas, the person moves away from his true self and faces various troubles in his life due to overdeveloped persona. Archetypal criticism approaches the underlying causes of the behavior of the characters in literary works and the plots of the works in the light of archetypes. Orhan Kemal’s novel ‘Murtaza’, in which he deals with Turkiye in the 1940s, is a work appropriate to be examined in terms of the persona archetype, which is one of the concepts of archetypist criticism. In this study, Murtaza, the protagonist of the novel, and the events that he experienced were tried to be touched on in the context of the “persona” archetype.

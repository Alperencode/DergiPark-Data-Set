Makale Başlığı: Target case in western dialects
Özet: Many studies have been carried out on Anatolian dialects until today. These studies are very valuable in terms of showing the phonetic characteristics of the region they deal with. As a matter of fact, many regions of Anatolia, which used to be accessible with limited means, are no longer inaccessible, television broadcasts and internet connections have spread to the most remote regions, and as a result, the dialect features of that region have begun to approach the standard language. For this reason, studies on dialect areas in the near future will be discussed based on the data of what has been done so far. The case category is also a subject that is considered in the morphology section of these dialect studies without giving much importance. The "target case", which is not included in the dialect studies we examined, but which states the main function, is the subject of this study. If the examples given under the direction/approaching in grammar studies are carefully examined, it will be seen that they also perform different function than direction/approach. The target case, which we examined in Western dialects, meaning-function oriented approach and its functions were determined accordingly.

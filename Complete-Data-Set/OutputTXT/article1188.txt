Makale Başlığı: Determination of Important Quality Parameters of Cumin  (Cuminum cyminum L.) Seeds Provided by Different Countries
Özet: Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) is one of the most consumed spices worldwide. In this study, seeds obtained from India, Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Türkiye (Denizli) were used as the materials. Different parameters including essential oil content of seeds (%), essential oil composition (%), fixed oil content (%), fatty acid composition (%), colour values (l, a, b), total phenolic substance (mg GAE/g dry herb) and total flavonoid substance (mg CE/g dry herb) were determined. Result showed that the content of essential oil in unground seeds varied between 1.08% and 4.68%, while, the values were 3.20%-5.02% in ground seeds. Gamma-terpinen-7-al, cuminal, gamma-terpinene and beta-pinene were the prominent main compounds in all cumin seed samples. The fixed oil content ranged from 2.38% to 17.50% in unground seeds and 2.25% to 17.47% in ground seeds. Six different fatty acids were found in fixed oil. Among these fatty acids, oleic acid was the main component. Oleic acid level varied between 56.63% and 65.12%. The CIE L*, a* and b* colour values of the samples ranged between 40.12-45.29, 2.37-7.88, and 17.85-25.95, respectively. Total phenolic matter and flavonoid content of the cumin seed samples were founded between 7.00-11.06 mg GAE/g DW and 2.04-5.08 mg CE/g DW, respectively.

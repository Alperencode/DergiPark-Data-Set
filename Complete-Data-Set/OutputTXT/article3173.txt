Makale Başlığı: Intervention in the Human Genome Ethical Discussions-Fiqh Approaches
Özet: The author, who has studies on current medical issues, discussed the genome in terms of belief, morality and law/fiqh principles in this work. The main concern is on which level of gene studies will affect the structure and future of the human being created most beautifully. The author underlines that there is no gene definition that scientists agree on, and different definitions are mentioned. This is the main focus of debates about the gene. Today, the fact that it is possible to add, remove and change the DNA of a living thing with gene editing technology means that the characteristic features of the living thing can be changed by intervening in its genome. Against biotechnological developments targeting nature and human health, the limits of values such as religion, morality and law must be clearly determined for humans to remain human despite everything. In gene studies, it has been stated that interventions that are not under the control of these values will result in disaster. In this study, I will discuss the limits in terms of Islamic law, which will respond to these concerns.

Makale Başlığı: Linguistic and Literary Terminologies in “Notes to the Rhetoric of the Ottomans” (Ta’lîkât-ı Belâgat-I Osmâniyye) by Abdurrahman Sureyya
Özet: Rhetoric is a deep-rooted discipline which involves the rules that identify the condition, trueness and beauty of an addressee and its relevance with space and time. Consisting of various units such as sense, statement and aesthetic, rhetoric also contains many rules of speech that form sub-units. This discipline which, in general, is applied to as a figure of speech in verse refers to the whole body of rules that regulate the order of expressions in a general sense. Distinguished as an area of research of the classical Turkish Literature, rhetoric also serves as a discipline which concerns linguistics as a result of its interaction with language based on terminology and expression. Its quality as a discipline of rules leads rhetoric to be a question of debate due to certain deficiencies and flaws which appear due to different approaches in application, and this gives rise to certain discussions as regards to the application of rhetoric rules in the works from Turkish Literature. Among these, one example is the tract “Notes to the Rhetoric of the Ottomans” (Ta’lîkât-ı Belâgat-ı Osmâniyye), a book written by Abdurrahman Sureyya as a critique of the rhetorical work by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha titled “The Rhetoric of the Ottomans” (Belâgat-ı Osmâniyye). Identifying the deficiencies in and making the critique of the “The Rhetoric of the Ottomans” of Ahmet Cevdet Pasha, “Notes to the Rhetoric of the Ottomans” is a work featuring linguistic and literary terminologies. This study provides the linguistic and literary terms found in “Notes to the Rhetoric of the Ottomans” (Ta’lîkât-ı Belâgat-ı Osmâniyye) by Abdurrahman Sureyya in alphabetical order together with their meanings and reveals the linguistic and literary terminology data in the work.

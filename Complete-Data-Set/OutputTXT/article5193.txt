Makale Başlığı: Case Study: An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Language and Speech Intervention for A Child with Childhood Apraxia of Speech
Özet: Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS), is a neurologically based speech sound disorder characterized with impairments in the accuracy and consistency of movements that form the basis of speech. The aim of this study was to evaluate the language and speech characteristics of a case with CAS and to investigate the effectiveness of short-term language and speech therapy. A boy aged 6 years and 11 months with CAS was included in the study. In the assessment procedure; Test of Early Language Development, Third Edition (TELD-3), Turkish version (TEDIL), Turkish Articulation and Phonology Test (SST) was used, and oral motor, stimulability and inconsistency assessments were completed. After the evaluation, speech therapy was planned in line with Nancy Kaufman’s Childhood Apraxia of Speech Intervention Method and Cued Articulation Technique. Therapy was applied once a week, in 8 sessions of 45 minutes. After the therapy, there was a decrease in the raw scores of SST and in the inconsistency ratings.  Stimulability ratings were improved. These findings provide initial data on the positive effect of short term language and speech therapy specific to childhood apraxia of speech.

Makale Başlığı: DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSROOM VIDEO RECORDING READINESS SCALE: A VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY STUDY
Özet: Video recording of classroom environments is becoming popular for the purposes, such as promoting teacher professional development, and raising awareness and competencies for personal development. Training providers and researchers should also consider  teacher expectations and learning needs about video use in their methodologies. The current research aims to develop the "Classroom Video Recording Readiness Scale" to examine the readiness of teachers for video recording in their classrooms and determine the validity and reliability of the scale. In the research, firstly, the use of video cameras in teacher professional development and video recording in the classroom were conceptualized with consecutive sessions for the item development.  Then, after administration of the survey  with 418 in-service teachers, factor analyzes to determine the construct validity and internal consistency coefficient, stratified alpha coefficient, item-total correlation and correlation between scale dimensions analysis to determine reliability was made. The final form consists of six dimensions loaded with 37 items named “knowledge of the using camera”, “knowledge of management of recording”, “knowledge of preparing the class environment”, “self-efficacy for recording”, “self-efficacy for coping with recording stress” and “attitude towards video recording”. As a result, it is thought that the developed scale has sufficient psychometric properties in terms of validity and reliability tests and will make significant contributions to the literature.

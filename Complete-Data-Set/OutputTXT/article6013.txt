Makale Başlığı: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SERUM FERRITIN LEVELS, INSULIN RESISTANCE, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS
Özet: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum ferritin, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and nutrition status in obese people. Total of 210 individuals, who were diagnosed as obese in 19 Mayıs Hospital, were included in this retrospective analysis. Anthropometric measurements, health status, biochemical results and nutrition status were obtained from patient files and recorded in the patient information form. Individuals that applied to this study seperated four quartiels according to their serum ferritin level; serum ferritin level ˂14,52 ng/mL as quartile 1 (Q1),  14,52-35,49 ng/mL as quartile 2 (Q2),  35,49-70,68 ng/mL as quartile 3 (Q3) and ˃70,68 ng/mL as quartile 4 (Q4). In waist circumference measurements, waist circumference in Q4 (114.85±15.09 cm) was greater than other quartiles, and the difference was not significant (p˃0.05). According to quartiles, trigliserit (169,43±93,40) and LDL levels (127,21±35,15) of Q4 and HDL levels of Q2 (58,68±11,69) were higher than other quartiles (p˂0.05). Protein consumption was greater in Q4 (112,1±29,8 g/day),  and carbonhydrates consumption was greater in Q1 (395,2±83,6 g/day) than other quartiles (p˂0.05). A positive, moderate correlation was found between the protein consumption (g/day) of obese individuals and serum ferritin levels (r:0,506, p:0,000). As a result, high serum ferritin concentrations were associated with high triglyceride, high LDL, high HOMA, AST and ALT values, and lower HDL values. High serum ferritin in obese individuals may be a risk factor for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes should be recommended to obese individuals to avoid these risk factors.Keywords: Obesity, insülin resistance, serum ferritin, metabolic syndrom

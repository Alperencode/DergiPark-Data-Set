Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Publication Rates of Orthodontics Speciality and Doctorate Theses Written Between 2016-2020
Özet: Postgraduate specialization and doctoral theses in dentistry are the first of many scientific steps. In our country, it is compulsory towrite a thesis and defend the written thesis in order to complete the specialty and doctorate education. Publication of theses ensures thedissemination of new knowledge in the scientific community. In our study, the theses written between 2016-2020 by 377 postgraduatestudents in dentistry taken by central examination and 149 doctoral students who were taken by universities’ own exams were examined.The delivery dates of the evaluated theses, research types, titles of the advisors, universities, subjects of the studies and their publicationstatus were recorded. The publication status of the theses was evaluated using Pubmed and Google Academic search engines and byscanning the author’s name, supervisor name, thesis titles in Turkish and English through Dergipark. Chi-square statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 26.0 program. The published theses were analyzed as SCIE / ESCI indexed journals, other national journalsand other international journals according to the scope of the journal, and their publication rates were calculated as percentages. It wasrevealed that the publication rates of a total of 526 theses, of which 71.67% are specialization theses and 28.32% are doctoral theses, was26.17% in doctoral theses and 17.5% in specialty theses.

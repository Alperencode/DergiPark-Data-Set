Makale Başlığı: Usage of Hadith in S̲h̲ams al-Tabrīzī’s Maḳālāt
Özet: S̲h̲ams al-Tabrīzī (d. 645/1247?) is a wandering dervish who became famous as the teacher and friend of Mawlānā Jalāl al-Dīn al-Rūmī (d. 672/1273), one of the important figures of Turkish Sufism. Even though there is no detailed information about who he is and his life, it is stated that he attained high ranks in the apparent and mystic/esoteric sciences. Unfortunately, he did not write down his scientific acquis. His various conversations with both Mawlānā and others were recorded by his students and reached today as Maḳālāt. This work, most of which was written in Persian, is the most important source that conveys the mystic thoughts and experiences of S̲h̲ams al-Tabrīzī. It reveals the depth of the scientific aspect of S̲h̲ams with many verses, hadiths and their interpretations it contains. However, as it is generally seen in the works on sufism, the evaluations of the hadith scholars about authenticity of ahadith were not taken into account in it while the hadith narrations are mentioned. This study aims to determine the hadith narrations, their sources and authenticity in that work referred to S̲h̲ams-i Tabrīzī.

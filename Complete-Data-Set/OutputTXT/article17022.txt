Makale Başlığı: A tradition of Delâilül'n-Nubuvva in the 5th Hijri Century: The Sample of Qadi Abd-al-Jabbar and Bayhāqī
Özet: The defensive reflex developed by Muslim scholars in order to eliminate the protest to the prophethood of Muhammad paved the way for the formation of the tradition that ıt’s called dalāılu'n-nubuvva in the historical process that the different religious and philosophical movements get involved in the Islamic society. This tradition which first started to come into existence with the efforts of Muʽtazilī scholars developed and continued its existence by the work of Salafist thinkers and hadith scholars. These developments made it possible for different methods naturally to emerge in the proof of prophecy. As a matter of fact that in addition to the wisdom and transmission-centered attitude developed by the Muʽtazila section has emerged a approach of narrator that only focuses on the transmission-centered. In this context, the work of Kadı Abd al-Jabbar who is known as Muʽtazilī scholar that its name "Tesbitu Dalāilu'n-Nubuvva" and the work of Bayhāqī who is muhaddith scholar that is name "Dalāilu'n-Nubuvva" was designed to prove the prophethood of Muhammad in the fifth century of the hijra by copyrighted using two different methods. In this study, we are planning to introduce and compare with outlines the two works of delâil authors who had methodical differences in the 5th century hijri. In addition, we think that by giving information about the lives of the authors, the method differences will become more understandable through the process and intellectual environment of these two authors.

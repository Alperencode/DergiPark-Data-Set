Makale Başlığı: Optimization of Cutting Parameters in Hard Turning of AISI H10A Steel under Minimum Quantity Lubrication
Özet: Inthis study, influences of cutting parameters in hard turning of hot work toolsteel by applying minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) were investigated andoptimized by using Taguchi methodology. Firstly, the machinability experimentson hardened AISI H10A hot work tool steel with CBN inserts were performed underthe MQL condition. The experiments were carried out by Taguchi’s L9 orthogonalarray. The machinability of AISI H10A steel were evaluated in terms of averagesurface roughness (Ra) and main cutting force (Fc). The analysis of variance(ANOVA) was applied to determine the effects of cutting parameters (cuttingspeed, feed rate and depth of cut) on surface roughness and cutting force. Itwas observed that surface roughness and cutting force increased with increasingfeed rate and depth of cut in machining by applying MQL with uncoated CBNinserts. Depth of cut was determined as the most important parameter on surfaceroughness with 66.57% PCR while feed rate was determined on cutting force with50.68% PCR. On the other hand, optimum cutting parameters for surface roughnessand cutting force were found at different levels as a result of Taguchioptimization.

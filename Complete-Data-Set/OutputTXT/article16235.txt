Makale Başlığı: Mineralogical-Petrographical and Gemological Properties of Chalcedony Occurences in  Artova Region (Tokat, Turkey)
Özet: The study area is located around Gümüşyurt and Bayırlı villages in the county of Artova in Tokat province, Turkey. Permian-aged amphibolite rocks formed the foundation of the region. In the upper part of this unit, Silurian-aged, grey-beige colored and recrystallized limestone is found. There are mainly metamorphic units of Permian metaclastics, metamorphic rocks and partially-silicified limestone blocks at the base. The metamorphic units of metabasic origin consist of rocks such as chlorideschist, glaucophaneschist, micaschist and amphibolite. The partially-silicified limestone blocks of white, cream, beige, and blackish grey colors are hard and brittle. The ophiolithic rocks from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous show a wide distribution in the south part of the study area. Eocene limestone/conglomerate units and Pliocene conglomerates are unconformably overlaid on all previous units. Chalcedony samples, mostly green in color, occur within a small part of the Eocene limestone. Various green tones of  the chalcedony samples can be seen in different parts of the study area. Although some translucent, dark brown to grey color tones of the chalcedony samples are lower gem-quality material, the majority of the samples are of gem  quality, good enough to be fashioned as cabochons and beads. Based on field observations, Raman spectroscopy, GemmoFTIR (Fouirer Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer for Gemology), geochemical analyses and standard gemological tests, the samples were identified as chalcedony in general with different tones of green,  specifically “Chromium Chalcedony”

Makale Başlığı: AN OTTOMAN TURKISH PERIODICAL AS A SOURCE BOOK FOR YOUTH: ‘MECMÛʻA-İ NEVRESÎDEGÂN’
Özet: Mecmûʻa-i Nevresîdegân was a periodical published for children/youth in Istanbul in the last period of the Ottoman Empire (1298/1882). The periodical was published by three young friends named H. Tayfur, A. Âsaf and A. Vasfi, who introduced themselves with the signature “Rüfekâ-yı selâse-yi tahririyye” and was offered for sale for two piasters. There are only two issues of the periodical, copies of which are displayed in three different libraries. Both issues comprise four sections. These four sections are diversified subjects, calculus, geography, and history.  Eight pages are allocated to each section of the periodical, which consists of thirty-two pages. When we look at the design of the periodical, it is seen that it was planned more like book chapters than a periodical. Mecmûʻa-i Nevresîdegân was designed as a single column. The main features that distinguish Mecmûʻa-i Nevresîdegân from other periodicals for children/youth are twofold: it is composed of four different sciences that can be collected as a supplementary source book, and it is possible to see the publication as a supplement and supporter of education in schools. With the article, Mecmûʻa-i Nevresîdegân, which was the first to use the word "mecmua" in its name, was introduced and presented to the attention of those interested.

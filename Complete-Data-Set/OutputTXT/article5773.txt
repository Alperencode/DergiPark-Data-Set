Özet: While people interact with others in their daily life routines, they make an extraordinary effort to present themselves more positively than they are. In this way, they try to shape the impressions of themselves on the eyes of others. In this study, it is intended to reveal which impression management tactics they apply to in the communication process with the supervisor of graduate students. The study is composed of graduate students who continue their education at state and private universities in Turkey. The sample of the research consists of 387 people selected by Easy Sampling. A survey was used as a data collection tool in the research. The study uses a comparative scan model from a relational scan model, a type of scan model. According to the findings obtained from the research, participants successfully use the impression management tactics to defend themselves through the process of managing their supervisor impressions. Another important finding obtained in the study is that master students use more self-love impression management tactics than PhD students, which is one of the sub-dimensions of self-promotion impression management tactic. As a result; postgraduate students frequently resort to impression management tactics in their communication with their supervisor.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Potassium Levels in Dairy Cows in the Periparturient Period
Özet: Detection and prevention of hypokalemia which causes economic losses and metabolic diseases in dairy cows had great importance. For this reason, the first objective of this study is to determine the level of blood potassium in dairy cows during the periparturient period and the second objective is to the determination of the relationship between metabolic diseases and blood potassium levels. A total of 60 cows were used in the study. Forty cows of them (Group I; 20 and group II;20) were pregnant and multiparous, and 20 of them with metabolic diseases (ketosis, displacement of abomasum). Blood samples of healthy cattle were taken from v.jugularis twice, 10 ml each time. The first blood sample was taken two weeks before calving, and the second blood sample was taken within two weeks after calving. Blood samples of 20 cattle with metabolic diseases were taken from v.jugularis once,  10 ml. Serum samples were analyzed for Na, K, Cl, Creatinine, AST, LDH, Mg, P, and CPK parameters. The mean potassium level of group I and II healthy cattle after calving was 2,35 ± 0,17 mmol/l and 2,71 ± 0,12 mmol/l, respectively. However, the mean potassium level of cattle with metabolic diseases was also 2,53 ± 0,06 mmol/l.In conclusion, development of negative K balance in dairy cows after birth were detected. Additionally, cattle with displaced abomasum and ketosis were also found hypokalemic.

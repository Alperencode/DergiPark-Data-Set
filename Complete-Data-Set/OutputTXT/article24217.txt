Makale Başlığı: Analysis of clinical and radiological results on the fixation of Neer type 2 distal clavicle fractures with a hook plate
Özet: Objective: We evaluated our clinical and radiological results on the fixation of Neer type 2 distal clavicle fractures with a hook plate in the light of the novel literature and regarding our early implant-related complications we aimed to highlight the importance of selecting suitable clavicle hook plate implants for fixation. Methods: We analysed retrospectively 16 patients (11 males, 5 females) who were diagnosed with Neer type 2 distal clavicle fractures and treated with hook plate fixation between 2013-2014. Mean age was 38 (range :27-61), and mean follow up was 14.3 (range: 12-18) months. Complications seen on radiographs were implant failure and subacromial osteolysis. The clinical results were evaluated with modified UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) scoring system. Results: Bone union was achieved in all patiens at the end of the first 4 months. Mean modified UCLA score was 32.75 (range 31-35). In 12 patients (68%), the implants had to be removed due to complications. After removal, the complaints regressed and shoulders' range of motion increased. Conclusion: Clinical and radiological results on the fixation of Neer type II distal clavicle fractures with a hook plate are good in terms of fracture union and function. The major disadvantage of the method was the requirement of early implant removal due to the hardware related complications and good results can be achieved only after plate removal.  Optimizing the length of hook plate may lower the complications. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0332This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

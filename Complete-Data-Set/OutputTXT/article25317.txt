Makale Başlığı: Preservice Elementary School Teachers’ Opinions Related to Oral History as a Teaching Method in Social Studies
Özet: In this study, preservice elementary school teachers’ opinions regarding oral history studies as a teaching method in social studies were examined. The data were collected from 93 preservice elementary school teachers in a faculty of education at one public university. The study was carried out using a basic qualitative research. The data were collected from participants by means of a questionnaire which included closed-ended (with yes and no options) and open-ended questions. In the study, it was found that none of the preservice elementary school teachers conducted any oral history study previously, most of the preservice elementary school teachers (N=89, 95.7%) felt efficacious in having their future students conduct oral history studies in their social studies classes. Most of the preservice elementary school teachers (N=90, 96.8%) indicated that they wanted to use oral history as a teaching method in their social studies classes because of abundant benefits to the students. Moreover, they think that elementary school students may encounter some difficulties/obstacles in conducting oral history studies.Keywords: Oral history, social studies, social studies teaching methods course, preservice elementary school teachers

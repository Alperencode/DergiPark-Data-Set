Makale Başlığı: New Challenge in the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights: Algorithmic Profiling
Özet: Algorithm-based systems often cause ethical concerns. It also violates the prohibition of discrimination due to inherited bias motives and the right to privacy, due to monitoring in the form of data surveillance. Understanding the paradigm shift in human rights, the symptoms of which are being felt in the current period, will help us to solve the problems caused by these ever-growing technologies. With a holistic approach, this study argues that ethical concerns can be eliminated, and human rights can be protected, while accepting that algorithmic-based systems create difficulties in promoting and protecting human rights. In comparison to human bias, algorithm bias will be easier to detect and eliminate from these systems, which are initially mathematical but have turned into a sociological entity in terms  of  results. For that reason, it is necessary not to be pessimistic in an extreme way. Therefore, multi-party and comprehensive negotiation processes should be followed in order to implement regulations that are compatible with the dynamic structures of these systems.

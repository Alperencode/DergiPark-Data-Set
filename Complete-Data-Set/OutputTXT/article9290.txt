Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Perceived Health Risk Associated with COVID-19 and Job Insecurity.
Özet: The COVID-19 crisis has caused significant losses in the tourism sector due to travel restrictions, and the uncertainty brought by the pandemic has brought hotel employees to the risk of losing their jobs. In this process, the fact that hotel businesses are closed for a while or downsizing may make it possible for employees to experience job insecurity. When the literature is examined, the limited number of studies examining the relationship between the perceived health risk of hotel employees and job insecurity has been decisive in the conduct of this study. In this context, the aim of this study is to reveal the relationship between the health risk perceived by the employees of five-star hotel businesses related to COVID-19 and job insecurity. Questionnaire technique, one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The study was carried out with employees of a five-star hotel in Istanbul. It has been found that the perceived health risk associated with COVID-19 has a positive and significant effect on job insecurity. At the same time, as a result of examining the significant effect of demographic characteristics on the relationship between health risk and job insecurity, it was determined that men, singles, people aged 25 and under and those working in the enterprise for less than 4 years and over 10 years contributed significantly to the model.

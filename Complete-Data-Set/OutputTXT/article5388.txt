Makale Başlığı: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PNEUMONIA ARTICLES (2016-2020)
Özet: Lower respiratory infections are one of the leading factors of death in the world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pneumonia comes to the fore from respiratory diseases. We aim to close the information gap regarding the characteristics of pneumonia articles published between the years 2016 and 2020 and indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) database by bibliometric analysis. We collected the data for this study from the articles published in the WoS, from 2016 to 2020 by using “pneumonia” as the keyword. Articles were found among the "Science Citation Index Expanded" of the WoS advanced search engine and 24,896 articles that met the criteria were included. MS Excel, Python, MS Power BI, and Flourish website were used for data extraction and visualization.This bibliometric analysis showed that while the number of articles published regarding pneumonia was more stable between 2016 and 2019 it has increased dramatically in 2020. It was seen that the countries that caused this significant increase were the United States of America and China. More than one-fifth of all articles were written in cross-country collaboration. The magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 on pneumonia research has been numerically demonstrated by this bibliometric analysis.

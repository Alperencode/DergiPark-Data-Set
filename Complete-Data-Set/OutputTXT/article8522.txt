Makale Başlığı: Some Evaluations on Commercial Customs as a Source of Commercial Law
Özet: Considering that the rules of customs and usages, which have been applied for a long time to settle into the common conscience of the people they address as a rule of law, are the sources of the provisions codified and enacted in time, it can be understood how important they are. On the other hand, it is seen that the customs and usages are far behind where they should be in today's practice, and they are forgotten by the practitioners, and this situation causes many problems. In this respect, the theoretical and practical re-evaluation of commercial customs is the mainstay of the study. The duty of determining and declaring commercial customs and usages has been given to the chambers of commerce in accordance with the Article 12 of the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey and the Law on Chambers and Commodity Exchanges, and to the Ministry of Justice Education Department with the Article 50 article of the Presidential Decree No. 1 on the Presidential Organization. In the study, while examining the elements, importance, purpose and function of commercial customs, the provisions of Mecelle-i Ahkam-ı Adliye, current comparative law and application examples will be used.

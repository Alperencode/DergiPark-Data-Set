Makale Başlığı: To The Qur’an Glossary Translation in Inter-Linear Translation By Rylands and in Kyrgyz And Turkish Translations
Özet: Thıs paper compares the translation of words and concepts of Qur’an in Rylands version, which is considered as one of the earliest interlinear translations of Qur’an, representing the features of Eastern Turkish that existed earlier than Chagatay period and in Qur’an translations published in contemporary Turkish and Kyrgyz.  In terms of glossary, the interlinear translation of the Qur’an (Rylands version) contains many common words that can be frequently noticed in Uyghur texts as well as in “Kutadgu Bilig” and “Divanu Lügati’t-Türk.” Many of these words, correspondingly, can also be shared with other Turkic dialects (such as Kypchak, Oguz). This list of glossary comparison also includes Turkish, respectively. Thus, it will be determined whether the phrases and words that have survived up today have undergone some changes due to the translation of Qur’an that was written in the 14th or 15th century, according to one point of view, or due to another translation that had been written in an even earlier period, according to another point of view, or remained the same. Later, structures and meanings of the glossary will be discussed in brief, and the correspondence of Turkish religious meanings and concepts to the words, concepts, and phrases (by creating a conceptual field) will be analyzed. Statistics will also be included at the end of the study. Findings about the translation methods through using the corpus will also be included in our study.

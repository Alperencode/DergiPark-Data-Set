Makale Başlığı: ADNAN MENDERES’S POLITICAL PERSUASION SKILLS AND  STRATEGIES DURING HIS LAST NATIONWIDE TRIPS
Özet: This study, suggesting that effective persuasion strategies and transcendent leadership can create a discourse that drags the masses, discussed Menderes’ nationwide trips during the last years of his rule. It aimed to explore Menderes’ leadership and persuasion skills considering his certain practices in those trips, such as close contact with the public, rhetorical skills, referring to the past, and manipulating political events. It is assumed that the general ambiance in those trips, regardless of the long-term outcomes, affected the relationship between Menderes and the public, and his persuasion skills also influenced the language of politics. The researchers scrutinized the local and national press, research papers, archive documents, and memoirs about Menderes’ trips.

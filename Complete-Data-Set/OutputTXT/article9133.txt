Makale Başlığı: Temperament Characteristics of Preschoolers and Maternal Acceptance and Rejection Statuses of Their Mothers
Özet: The study was conducted to examine the relationship between maternal acceptance-rejection and children’s temperament characteristics and whether children’s temperament characteristics predicted maternal acceptance-rejection. The data of the study, which employed a predictive correlational design, were obtained from 349 children in the 4-6 age group attending preschool education and their mothers. The data were collected using the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist and analyzed using Pearson’s Correlation Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. As a result of the study, a significant relationship was found between maternal acceptance-rejection and all temperament traits except discomfort, fear, shyness, impulsivity, and approach/positive participation. It was also found that maternal coldness and lack of affection were predicted by perceptual sensitivity, low-intensity pleasure, and smiling and laughter, maternal hostility and aggression were predicted by falling reactivity and soothability, maternal indifference and neglect were predicted by sadness, and maternal undifferentiated rejection was predicted by the temperament characteristics of attentional focusing and anger/frustration.

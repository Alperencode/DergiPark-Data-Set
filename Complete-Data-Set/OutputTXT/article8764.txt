Makale Başlığı: Kadınların doğum şekline ilişkin tercihleri ve Türkiye'de sezaryen doğum yönteminin mevcut durumunun gözden geçirilmesi
Özet: Aim: Increasing cesarean section (C/S) rates have become a growing public health issue. Turkey ranked among the top countries in the world for the highest cesarean rates. Why women desire CS instead of vaginal birth may be the key to avoiding unnecessary C/Ss. In this study, we performed a questionnaire to evaluate the possible reasons for maternal CS requests in one of the largest maternity care hospitals in Turkey.Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was applied among pregnant women, focused on the preference of the mode of delivery and the reasons for the preferences.Results: Of the 1200 women who answered the questionnaire about the mode of delivery, 45.7% were nulliparous and of these, 85% preferred vaginal delivery. Of the women who had vaginal birth previously, 93.4% preferred vaginal delivery. Of the women who had a previous c-section, 11.8% preferred to try a vaginal delivery. The main factor that affected the preference for C/S was the previous history of C/S. When the patients with a previous history of C/S were excluded; a history of previous spontaneous abortion and longer marital relationships were found to be the factors associated with C/S preference. of women who preferred vaginal delivery 55.8% stated that vaginal delivery was preferred because the most natural way of childbirth was a vaginal birth. Discussion and Conclusion: Elective cesarean section in the absence of clinical indications is one of the most discussed topics of obstetric practice. The reason for the first C/S should be very well-reviewed to provide a logical approach to the current rates of C/S. Childbirth fear is also an important point to be carefully evaluated for especially nulliparous women.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the newborns with urinary tract infection
Özet: Purpose: Retrospective evaluation of infants followed up with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the neonatal unit.Materials and methods: The clinical, laboratory findings and prenatal-postnatal imaging of 50 newborns followed up between 2015 and 2019 in our neonatal unit with the diagnosis of UTI (>10,000 cfu/ml microorganism growth in urine-culture taken via catheter) were evaluated.Results: Of 50 cases included in the study, 23 were female and 27 were male. Mean gestational-age was 34.3±4.6 weeks (minimum-maximum:23-41).  Most cases (n=42, 84%) were normal weight for gestational-age.Twenty(40%) cases were asymptomatic, while thirty(60%) were symptomatic. Fever was more common in term infants, apnea was more common in preterms. E.coli growth (48%, n=24) and Klepsiella pneumoniae (26%, n=13) were frequently detected in urine-cultures. 12 (24%) of blood-cultures taken simultaneously were positive (16% for coagulase-negative-staphylococci, n=8). All cases were evaluated with postnatal urinary-system ultrasonography (USG); While 16 (32%) abnormal findings (n=5, 31.2% hydronephrosis; n=10, 68.8% nephrolithiasis, pelvicalyceal ectasia) were detected, 34 (68%) were normal. Vesicoureteral-reflux (VUR) was detected in half of 12 cases (n=6, 50%) had abnormal ultrasound findings and underwent voiding-cysto-ureterography.Conclusion: While 40% of infants found to have UTI in the neonatal unit were asymptomatic, 60% were symptomatic, and E.coli growth was often observed in urine-culture. Postnatal urinary-system USG revealed abnormal findings in approximately 1/3 of these cases, hydronephrosis in 31.2% of them, and advanced VUR in all of hydronephrosis. In conclusion, newborns with UTI should be evaluated with ultrasound in terms of urinary-system malformation that may accompany, and those with hydronephrosis should be investigated for vesicoureteral-reflux.

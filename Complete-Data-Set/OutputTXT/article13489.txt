Makale Başlığı: Relationship between subclinical hyperthyroidism and ventricular repolarization markers
Özet: Objective: To evaluate repolarization defects and arrhythmogenic predisposition through ventricular repolarization markers in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism (sHT).Materials and Methods: Patients with asymptomatic endogenous sHT and healthy participants with similar age and demographic characteristics were included in our study. Laboratory tests and echocardiographic evaluations were performed. Specific ventricular repolarization markers,such as QT, QTc (corrected QT inteval by Bazett formula) dispersion, Tpeak-Tend (Tp-e) interval, and Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were obtained with manually on electrocardiograpy.Results: A total of 90 participants were included in our study. The mean age was 59.04±13.28 years for the 45 patients in the sHT group and mean 57.13±15.87 years for the 45 controls. The PR, QT and QTc dispersions were found to be significantly higher in the sHT group (p<0.05 for all). While the PR and QT intervals did not significantly differ between the groups, QTc (p<0.05) was significantly higher in the sHT group. Tp-e , Tp-e/QT,and Tp-e/QTc were also found to be at higher levels in the sHT group than in the control group (p<0.001 for all). A statistically significant negative correlation was detected between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the Tp-e interval, QT, QTc dispersion, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratio, with Tp-/QT having the highest correlation coefficient (r: -0.298, p=0.004).Conclusion: Compared with healthy subjects, patients with sHT had a longer Tp-e interval and higher Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios. The TSH levels were negatively correlated with the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios.

Makale Başlığı: Risk of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants born to advanced maternal age pregnancies
Özet: Background: Little is known about the effect of advanced maternal age on preterm morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the possible relationship between maternal age and morbidity and mortality in premature infants born at a gestational age ≤32 weeks.Methods: Premature infants born at ≤32 weeks of gestation and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were divided into three groups by maternal age: <35, 35-39, and ≥40 years. Infant and maternal demographic and clinical characteristics, and preterm morbidity and mortality were compared between the groups.Results: A total of 827 preterm infants were included. Their distribution by maternal age was as follows: 659 infants in the <35 years group, 120 in the 35-39 years group, and 48 in the ≥40 years age group. Older maternal age was associated with higher gravidity, frequency of assisted reproductive technology use, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and caesarean delivery (P=0.004, P<0.001, P=0.007, P=0.004, and P<0.001, respectively). Respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and necrotising enterocolitis were significantly more frequent in preterm infants aged ≥35 years (P=0.014, P=0.029, and P<0.001, respectively).Conclusions: In addition to the maternal risks associated with pregnancy at older ages, some prematurity morbidities may also increase in frequency. Although this novel study presents important results, further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between advanced maternal age and preterm morbidity.

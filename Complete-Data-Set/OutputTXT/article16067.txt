Makale Başlığı: Natural enemies of the Tomato leafminer [Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)] in tomato and potato production areas in Tire and Odemis Districts of Izmir Province, Turkey
Özet: The study was conducted to determine the natural enemies of Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in Tire and Ödemiş Districts of Izmir Province, Turkey in 2019-2020. Natural enemies were collected weekly by sweep netting and culturing from infested tomato and potato plants. Many parasitoids and predators from different families were identified. The predatory species, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and many parasitoids from the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, were recorded as widespread natural enemies. Programs to protect natural enemies and increase their effectiveness should be implemented to control this serious pest.

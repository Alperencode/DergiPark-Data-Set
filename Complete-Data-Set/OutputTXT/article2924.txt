Makale Başlığı: Dredging Technology of Placer Deposits in the Far North
Özet: The authors consider the problem of reducing the dredge performance when operating at subzero air temperatures. This problem is particularly relevant for deposits located in the Far North, where the dredging season is limited by climatic conditions. During the period of subzero air temperatures dredge performance decreases significantly due to the icing of dredge structure. In consequence, dredging operations are terminated until the occurrence of favorable conditions for work. In this regard, the authors propose a method for isolating the open-pit mine with a hangar made of contemporary construction materials. Cellular polycarbonate, which has several advantages, was chosen as the most promising material for insulating dredging works. The article offers the technical and technological solutions for the proposed method of extending the dredging season. The costs of a dredge hangar for dredges of different sizes and the annual cost of its movement are calculated. A method has been developed for determining the optimal maneuvering angle of the dredge and the width of the single face, whose values depend on the type of dredge and the gold content in the sand. The areas of dredge hangars are determined by the graphical-analytic method. The article presents an example of the air temperature dynamics in a dredge hangar during the year, as well as determines the duration of the mining season.

Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Cyanoacrylate on Clinical Healing and Self-Reported Outcomes Following Free Gingival Graft Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Study
Özet: Objective: This study aims to reveal the effects of cyanoacrylate application at the recipient bed and the donor site in free gingival graft surgery on graft dimensions, clinical healing parameters and patient-based outcomes. Methods: Free gingival graft operations were conducted on individuals who were randomly assigned to control or test groups. In the test group, the graft was stabilized and the donor site was coated with cyanoacrylate. In the control group, 6/0 polyvinylidene fluoride sutures were used for stabilization, while the donor site was left untreated. Variables including re-epithelization, post-operative complications, pain, bleeding and quality of life at recipient site, and color match, graft dimensions at donor site were assessed for up to 6 months. Results: Twenty-three individuals completed the study. No differences were observed in any variable between groups except horizontal dimension loss of the graft, which was more abundant in the cyanoacrylate group at six months (p>0.05, p<0.05; respectively). Conclusion: According to our results, cyanoacrylate can be used safely for free gingival graft surgery, but does not surpass conventional suturing with polyvinylidene fluoride.

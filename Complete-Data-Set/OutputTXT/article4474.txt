Makale Başlığı: The Value of Fibrinogen/Albumin Ratio on Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients
Özet: Aim: Fibrinogen and albumin are proteins that play a role in inflammation. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the role of fibrinogen, albumin, and fibrinogen/albumin ratio (FAR) levels as markers of disease severity and prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.Material and Methods: Seventy-one patients aged between 19 and 84 years diagnosed with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital, Neurology Department between March and May 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Fibrinogen, albumin, FAR, D-dimer, platelet, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of the patients were compared according to the length of hospitalization duration, survival, and clinical severity of COVID-19.Results: Twenty-eight (%39.4) of the patients were male and 43 (%60.6) were female, and the mean age was 55.7±20.7 years. There was a significant difference between the groups of COVID-19 clinical severity in terms of age, fibrinogen, albumin, FAR, D-dimer, and CRP values (all p values were <0.001). Also, significantly higher fibrinogen, FAR, D-dimer, and CRP values were found in patients hospitalized longer, while the albumin level was lower in these patients (all p values were <0.001). FAR values were higher and albumin values were lower in non-surviving patients compared to surviving patients (p=0.025 and p<0.001, respectively).Conclusion: FAR levels may be useful in predicting mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. In addition, it may be helpful and useful in determining the prognosis since it has higher levels as the severity of the disease and the length of hospital stay increase.

Makale Başlığı: Features of Psychologism in Fictional Documentary Biography
Özet: Biographical works created in recent years reflect the fate of creative people who were oppressed by the system in the Soviet years, lived in an atmosphere of restrictions and persecution. In such works, it is not the character's “success story” that is depicted, but the difficulties he faces. The life of the main image is not depicted entirely, the author uses a "large" image, focusing on episodes in which the collision of a creative person with the system is most vividly reflected. Although the authors refer to specific facts and events, these works also depict a generalized picture of the Soviet period. The article examines the means of psychological description, the peculiarities of psychologism characteristic of fiction and fiction-documentary literature, the author's concept, associative composition. Biographical works of Anar "Life hurts" and "Freely Kerem" were analyzed.

Makale Başlığı: An analysis on the use and performance of contemporary avant-garde trombone techniques
Özet: The 20th century was a period in which the understanding of music changed and developed, and at the same time sought different pursuits in music. In many musical genres such as classical music, jazz and blues, various technical, trials and studies have begun on instruments. Many new studies have emerged with the development of globalization and technology and the changing understanding of music. In the history of music, it is possible to come across many works written in almost every musical period for many instruments and a repertoire spanning centuries for them. Since trombone was added to the orchestra and was not viewed as a solo instrument until recently, only a limited repertoire for trombone was existed before the 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century, the advancement of technology allowed composers to challenge the limitations of the instrument; new trombone techniques and repertoire were created. In the article through the categories of “trombone and voice,” multi phonic and microtone,” and “trombone and electronics,” works written in the second half of the 20th century will be discussed. In addition, the article will also evaluate the advantages of trombone performers and educators with in-depth knowledge of modern solo trombone works, and examine the contributions of innovative works to literature, education and musical culture.

Makale Başlığı: SHORT FORM HEALTH SURVEY VERSION-2.0 (SF-36v2) SHOULD BE USED FOR RESEARCHES IN ORTHOPEDICS
Özet: Objective: Although the Short Form Health Survey version-2.0 (SF-36v2) is widely used in the world since 2000, the researchers and clinicians in Turkey have been still using the original version. However, the original version includes many deficiencies and the SF-36v2 introduced to correct these deficiencies. The purpose of the study is to indicate difference between SF-36 and SF-36v2 and the cross cultural adaptation, reliability and validity of the SF-36v2. Patients and Methods: The SF-36v2 was cross culturally adapted to Turkish and the measurement prop¬erties of the Turkish version of the modified CMS were tested tested in 50 patients (19 males; mean ± SD age: 36.9 ± 14.6 years; range: 16-65 years, BMI; 24.1± 4.6) with a variety of musculoskletal pathologies. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to estimate the test-retest reliability. Construct validity was analyzed with SF-36v2 and EuroQol Group (EQ-5D). The distribution of ceiling and floor effects was determined. Results: During the cross-cultural adaptation process many changes were made. The Turksih SF-36v2 subscales showed excellent test-retest reliability which was ranged 0.80 to 0.95. The highest reliability was found between SF-36v2-PCS and SF-36v2-PF (r=0.75), the lowest  reliability was found between SF-36v2-PCS and SF-36v2-MH (r=0.05). Correlations between EQ-5D and SF-36v2 subscales ranged from 0.10 (SF-36v2 -VT) to 0.46 (SF-36v2 -RE). We observed no ceiling and floor efffects. Conclusion: The cultural adaptation of the SF-36v2 was successful. The SF-36v2 has sufficient reliability and validity to measure a variety of musculoskeletal pathologies for Turkish-speaking individuals. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0330This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

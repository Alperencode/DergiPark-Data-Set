Makale Başlığı: Role of Heat Shock Protein Influencing Bioactive Compounds From Mangrove Tropical Estuarine Microalgae for Enhancement of Copepod Egg Production in Culture System
Özet: In silico investigations of the natural bioactive compounds in the microalgae from mangrove tropical estuaries showed an influence on heat shock protein -70 production. Incorporation of algae with such compounds in the diet of copepod high density culture might lead to enhanced egg production. For this study, the structure of the ligands (bioactive compounds from microalgae in the region of the mangrove estuary) and X-ray crystal structure of hsp-70 complex was taken from PDB (3P9Y) with a resolution of 2.10 Å. The molecular docking study was performed using GOLD software. In the present study, a total of ten bioactive compounds showed good molecular interaction with hsp-70 protein. Among these bioactive compounds, Quercetin from the microalga, Chlamydomonas eugametos exhibited the highest molecular interaction and this compound is potential for enhancement of hsp-70 protein compared to other bioactive compounds and is considered a good nutrient enrichment for copepod culture as well as enhancement of hsp-70 protein against ROS and adverse environmental conditions. Successful high density copepod culture might lead to scaling up of hatchery rearing of marine finfish larvae.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Tourism Potential of the TRA1  Region in Terms of Regional Development Policies
Özet: The TRA1 Region, which consists of Erzurum, Erzincan and Bayburt provinces, which is the subject of this study, shows that on the basis of the underdevelopment differences of the region, backwardness is experienced strongly as we go from the western regions of our country to the eastern regions. The aim of the study is to examine the socio-economic structure of the TRA1 Region in the light of available data and to determine the development potential of the region in terms of tourism. For this purpose, in the study, firstly, information on basic issues such as regional development, regional planning and regional imbalance was given, and a comparative analysis of the population, health and education status of the TRA1 region with Turkey's statistical data was made. In addition, statistical data were used to determine the tourism potential of the TRA1 Region. SWOT analysis of the TRA1 Region has been made and the strengths and weaknesses of the region in terms of tourism have been revealed. According to the results of the analysis, it has been concluded that although the TRA1 Region has a strong tourism potential, the opportunities cannot be utilized sufficiently, the region is not promoted sufficiently, and the necessary strategies should be created to eliminate the weaknesses of the region in terms of tourism and the threats arising from it.

Makale Başlığı: Rapid and Safe Shelter Construction with 3-D Printing
Özet: Purpose: The opportunities, potentials and handicaps by use of 3-D printing in construction technologies and methods on emergency shelter construction have been investigated with a proposed scenario.Methodology/Approach: State of the art of 3-D printing in construction technology has been explored by referencing key terms and terminologies. Emergency sheltering conditions and requirements were described in the official reports and a scenario is established incorporating the use of 3-D printing technology on establishment of an emergency shelter center instead of the use of existing sheltering units.Findings: In addition to taking benefit from general advantages of 3-D printing in construction such as rapid construction, use of local material, and almost no waste disposal, it presents a certain level of user-oriented design and comfort at shelter units in terms of size and commissioning options. Originality: 3-D printing in construction is a developing new topic. The paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of 3-D printing technology in emergency shelter creation upon a scenario. Limitations: The research is based upon the scenario of the use of 3-D printing in emergency shelter construction without making real-world experiments and thus relies on synthetic findings. The study must be supported by detailed in site experiments incorporating 3-D printing and emergency sheltering stakeholders.Practical Implications: Regarding the existing official reports, emergency sheltering units are required to be constructed and installed as fast as possible when the emergency condition becomes real due to manufacturing time and cost limitations. Since 3-D printing has the ability to overcome such limitations, it has been revealed that there are also opportunities for the user to make a certain level of customization on the design and manufacturing of shelter units.

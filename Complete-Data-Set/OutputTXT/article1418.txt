Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Brain Oxygenation by Near Infrared Spectroscopy in Healthcare Professionals Using Surgical and FFP2/N95 Masks
Özet: Aim: The present study aimed to detect changes in brain oxygenation associated with the use of surgical and FFP2/N95 masks using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method.Material and Methods: Volunteers wearing surgical masks were asked to sit upright for 30 minutes. Cerebral oxygen saturation values were measured at the 1st, 5th, and 30th minutes (group 1). The mask wearers were requested to return at the same time on the day following this procedure. In group 2, serial cerebral oxygen saturation values (SpO2) were obtained at the same time intervals as in group 1, but while the subjects were wearing FFP2/N95 masks.Results: A statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the comparison of the values measured using NIRS at the 1st, 5th, and 30th minutes in group 1. According to the post-hoc analysis, this difference was due to discrepancies in NIRS measurements at the 1st minute and 30th minute and at the 5th minute and 30th minute. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the comparison of the values measured using NIRS at the 1st, 5th, and 30th minutes in group 2.Conclusion: Neither surgical nor FFP2/N95 masks caused a clinically significant negative difference in brain oxygenation.

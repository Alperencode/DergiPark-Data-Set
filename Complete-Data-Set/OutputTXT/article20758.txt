Makale Başlığı: SQUATTER HOUSE OUTLOOK OF SOCIAL AND  ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN TURKEY: THE  EXAMPLE OF AKDERE SQUATTER SETTLEMENT
Özet: As in all over the world, in Turkey, the industrial revolution caused a series of structural transformations. The squatter houses that erupted in urban areas are the result of this process after 1950. This study considers squatter houses as a kind of spatial reflection of labor, and it aims to understand the construction of those squatter houses as a place of hope. Moreover, the study approaches to the struggle, the strategies developed in order to be permanent in the city and to be incorporated in the economic life, and social mobility opportunities of the squatters from the viewpoint of squatters. In this study, qualitative research design has been utilized. The fieldwork covered the Akdere district of Mamak, one of the first squatter settlements in Ankara, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 people. According to the research results, it is possible to divide the processes affecting the social mobility of migrants into two parts. First, individual strategies such as social solidarity have been developed by immigrants themselves in the hope of being permanent in the city. The second is political influences causing immigrants to be an integral part of the city, such as the provision of basic services to the squatter settlements, amnesty for illegal housing, and the processes of urban transformation

Makale Başlığı: Effect of Commercial Transactions and Consumer Transactions Concepts on Commercial Case and Mediation As A Cause of Action
Özet: The recognition of mediation as a cause of action in commercial cases and consumer courts has increased the importance of the concepts of commercial transaction and consumer transaction. Not every commercial transaction will result in a commercial case and not every commercial case may be heard in commercial courts of first instance. While it is essential for commercial actions to be heard in the commercial court of first instance, it is also possible to be heard in the consumer court because the dispute originates from a consumer transaction. In this context, first of all, the scope of consumer transaction and commercial transaction concepts and the effect of these qualifications on commercial actions should be determined. Following the determination of this effect, it is necessary to determine the consequences of this distinction on mediation in commercial actions. Because the cause of action mediation is accepted as a rule in both commercial and consumer transactions. The cause of action application emphasizes the need of comprehending and appropriately characterizing the aforementioned notions. The distinction between commercial transaction and consumer transaction results in a variety of different consequences, such as being subject to different regulations in applying for "cause of action" mediation. This article aims to distinguish these concepts from each other and to reveal the differences between mediation processes.

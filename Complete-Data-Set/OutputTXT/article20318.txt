Makale Başlığı: Proclamation of Truman Doctrine and Its Effects in Turkey
Özet: Towards the end of World War II, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) gave the first signals for expansionist policy. It was demonstrated by bringing the Straits question to the agenda demanding changes in its favour at the border of Turkey, determined in 1921. When WWII ended, the power balance in Europe changed. Two great powers, USSR and The United States of America (USA), remained as the centres of power. USSR, desiring to turn this emerging power vacuum into an opportunity, accelerated expansionist policies. The countries most exposed to this threat were Greece and Turkey. These policies of USSR disturbed USA as they are contrary to the interests of itself and Europe. To prevent, President Truman delivered a speech to Congress on March 12, 1947. In this speech, called as the "Truman Doctrine", he asked the Congress for authorization to provide 400 million dollars of military aid to Greece and Turkey, which was accepted. In this study, the conditions necessitating the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine, the proclamation of the doctrine and the reflections of these developments in Turkish public opinion were examined and it is aimed to contribute to healthier understanding of the subject.

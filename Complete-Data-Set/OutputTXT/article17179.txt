Makale Başlığı: Examination of Interface Usability in Multi-Step Processes with A/B Testing Method
Özet: This study aims to examine to what extent design difference in the interfaces, which are called “wizards” in the literature and include different steps related to each other, varies in terms of usability. For this purpose, a web-based system, which the students and the staff of Kırklareli University use to reset their e-mail passwords, was used. The interface (A) of this system when it was put into service and another new interface (B), which has a design difference, were compared with the A/B test method from the perspective of usability. Both interfaces have wizard features; the difference between the B interface and A is that the steps users go through are named in interface B. In the results of the study, no difference was found between the interfaces in terms of effectiveness. On the other hand, the Mann-Whitney U test showed that interface B creates a more efficient user experience than A (p<0,01). While Spearman Correlation measurement did not reveal a relationship between productivity and satisfaction at interface B (p=0,467), it revealed a negative relationship, albeit weakly, at interface A (rs = -0,137, p<0,05). All the findings revealed in the study were explained in detail, and it was tried to shed light on the points that could be considered in future studies on usability.

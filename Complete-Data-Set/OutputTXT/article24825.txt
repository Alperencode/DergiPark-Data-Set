Makale Başlığı: Academic Procrastination in Middle School: Is It Related to Perceived Parental Attitudes and Locus of Control?
Özet: DOI: 10.5152/hayef.2019.1901Academic procrastination is a prevalent self-handicapping strategy among students in the face of academic tasks; therefore, understanding the nature of this phenomenon enhances academic outcomes. Several studies on procrastination have been conducted among secondary school students and undergraduates. However, research focusing on the early years in education is minimal. This study investigated the relation between academic procrastination, perceived parental attitudes, and locus of control in middle school students. The study was conducted on 511 middle school students attending sixth (n=169), seventh (n=165), and eighth (n=177) grades at four different schools. Academic procrastination increased based on the increase in students’ perceptions of their parents as being more authoritarian. Similarly, the more students perceived low levels of locus of control, the more they procrastinated. Male students were more likely to procrastinate than females. Academic procrastination was likely to increase for the higher grades; however, it declined due to the parents’ higher education level. Cite this article as: Özzorlu, E., İnanKaya, G. (2019).

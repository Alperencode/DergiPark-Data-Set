Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Constitutional Court Decision Numbered E:2019/115 in terms of the Application of the Principle of Procedural Vested Rights in Administrative Procedure Law
Özet: The principle of procedural vested rights, which originated in civil procedure law, was also accepted by the case law of the Council of State and started to be implemented in administrative procedure law. Although the principle was criticized as not being compatible with the characteristics of the administrative procedure law, it was given a legal basis with the provision of article 50/4 of the İYUK, after being implemented for a while with the procedure. Criticisms regarding the implementation of the principle of procedural vested rights continued on the provision of article 50/4 of the IYUK, which is the legal basis of the principle. The decision of the Constitutional Court with the number 2019/115 regarding the provision of article 50/4 of the İYUK, which was brought before the Constitutional Court by appeal, seems to have given direction to the implementation of the Council of State by clarifying some issues regarding the implementation of the principle of procedural vested rights. The interpretations of the Constitutional Court on the provision of article 50/4 of the IYUK within the scope of the principle of procedural vested rights are important in terms of clarifying how the principle of procedural vested right should be applied in administrative procedure law.

Makale Başlığı: THE GHOSTS OF IMAGE: FROM WRITERS’ MUSEUMS TO THE MNEMOSYNE ATLAS
Özet: In this paper we aim, by opening up to exploration the possible definitions or aspects of the concept of image, to demonstrate that the state of emotion and the truth described by Gilles Deleuze as the ideal essence of signifiers of art is in fact manifested in the image.  As samples in visual culture of embodiement of art signifiers as conceptualized through literature in Deleuze’s book Proust and Signs, we employ critical close analysis to Orhan Pamuk’s Museum of Innocence in Cukurcuma and Aby Warburg’s Bilderatlas (Memory Atlas). The rationale behind this selection is motivated both by their thematic similarities with Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time and by the qualities of the relationship they establish between memory and image.The in-depth interview conducted with the art director of the museum, Kıymet Daştan puts forth a qualitative resarch value.

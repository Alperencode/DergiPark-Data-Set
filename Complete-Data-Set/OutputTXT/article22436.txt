Makale Başlığı: Antioxidant capacity of different parts of artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.)
Özet: The study aims to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of different parts of the artichoke plant. In this study, three different parts of the plant (stem, leaf, and bract) were examined. TEAC, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity; FRAP, ferric reducing antioxidant power; PHEN, total phenolics; TMA, total monomeric anthocyanins ·OH, hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity; SOS, superoxide removal capacities were examined. According to the results of the study, the highest total phenol content was obtained from 2013.58±81.23 μg GAE/g fw bract. The lowest value 1536.12±86.71 μg GAE/g fw was obtained from the stem part of the plant. TEAC and FRAP methods were used to measure antioxidant capacity. Accordingly, the part of the plant with the highest antioxidant capacity was determined from bract (20.23±1.31 and 20.23±1.31 µmol/L). As a result, it was concluded that C. scolymus exhibits a good antioxidant effect, and its consumption as food is important for human health.

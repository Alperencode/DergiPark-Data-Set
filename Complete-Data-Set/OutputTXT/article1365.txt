Makale Başlığı: The Bryophyte Flora of Van Lake and Environs (Van/Türkiye)
Özet: As a result of the identification of 800 envelope bryophyte specimens, 175 taxa were recorded from the research area. No hornwort taxa could be detected and only 7 taxa liverwort belong to 5 genera were collected from the area. Factors affecting the low number of liverworts can be listed as limited habitat diversity, poor water resources, high ultraviolet, rapid evaporation and poor vegetation. Mosses are represented by 168 taxa in 67 genera belonging to 17 families. Pottiaceae, Brachytheciaceae, Orthotrichaceae, Grimmiaceae, and Bryaceae which have more than ten taxa are the most species-rich families in the research area. These families, which mostly contain xerophilous taxa, are compatible with the climate of the region. Taxa, such as Asterella saccata and Orthotrichum cupulatum var. fuscum which were recently given as new records for Turkey from the research area, reveal the bryophyte diversity potential of the region. Studies to be carried out in areas that are relatively less known in terms of bryophytes, such as Eastern Anatolia, are extremely important in terms of understanding the diversity of bryophytes in the country. In this regard, the present study provides important information on the diversity of bryophytes in Eastern Anatolia.

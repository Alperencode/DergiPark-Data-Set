Makale Başlığı: A POSTSTRUCTURALIST APPROACH TO BEHÇET NECATİGİL’S “DIE IN BOOKS” AND PERCY B. SHELLEY’S “OZYMANDIAS”
Özet: Ferdinand de Saussure, the founder of structural linguistics, studied language as a systemof signs. Literary structuralism, based on the thesis that there is an arbitrary relationshipbetween the signifier and the signified, confines the sign to a single meaning. In the poststructuralistapproach, which finds its expression most strongly with Jacque Derrida, it focuses onthe meaning that can never be fixed.In this approach, in which hierarchies of meaning are undermined, the multiplicity of themeaning in the texts is foregrounded. This approach, which also questions the position of thetraditional, authoritarian figure of the author who imposes the dominant point of view bringsthe relationship between the reader and the text to the fore and the reader’s multiple perspectivesgains importance regarding the production of meaning. In particular, the disablingof the author’s activity by the destruction of the traditional authoritarian figure is the focusof both poems on text and reading. These poems, which develop around the relationshipbetween the reader, the text and the author, allow a reader-centred reading in terms of thesubject they deal with. The aim of this study is to examine the poems “Die in Books” and“Ozymandias” with a poststructuralist approach, to reveal the dynamic between the text andthe reader. It also aims to discuss how the author’s traditional authoritarian perspective hasbeen changed and how hierarchies of meaning have been deconstructed.

Makale Başlığı: Distribution and identification of important plant parasitic nematodes in anise growing areas
Özet: Anise, Pimpinella anisum L. (Apiales: Apiaceae) is an important medicinal aromatic plant and can be attacked by different pests and pathogens. Plant parasitic nematodes are important pests that can be confused with nutrient deficiency or symptoms of various diseases or pests. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of these pests is essential for integrated nematode management and rotation. In 2021, a survey was conducted in Bolvadin District of Afyonkarahisar Province, which is one of the most important anise production areas of Türkiye. Forty-two soil samples were collected from the anise growing areas in the district and 16 species-specific primers were used for molecular identification of plant parasitic nematodes. In the samples, Meloidogyne hapla Chitwood, 1949 (Tylenchida: Heteroderidae), Pratylenchus neglectus (Rensch, 1924) Filipjev & Schuurmans Stekhoven, 1941, Pratylenchus thornei Sher & Allen, 1953 (Tylenchida: Pratylenchidae) and Aphelenchoides besseyi Christie, 1942 (Aphelenchida: Aphelenchoididae), were detected at the rates of 57% (24), 52% (22), 36% (15) and 7% (3), respectively. Plant parasitic nematodes were found in both single and mixed populations. In addition, A. besseyi was found for the first time in anise growing areas.

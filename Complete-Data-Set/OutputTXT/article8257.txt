Makale Başlığı: MEDICAL ILLUSTRATION AS A HYBRID VISUALIZATION PHENOMENON FROM ART TO DESIGN UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MAX BRÖDEL
Özet: Today, the permeability of art and design has increased and this permeability has turned into a hybrid visualization field, bringing more interdisciplinary approaches to the agenda. In this context, with the use of illustration as a visual expression technique in different disciplines and media, many types of illustration have emerged. One of these types is medical illustration, which provides a practical solution for easier understanding of scientific methods and simplification of anatomical education. Medical illustration, which has been providing the transfer of pathological and anatomical information to individuals and society for centuries, helps medical students to develop a more effective and efficient approach to the functional structure of the body. Especially with the discovery of photography, medical illustrators also had difficulties in deciding whether to exhibit an artistic approach or to create a one-to-one realistic illustration after pictorial techniques such as drawing, printing and engraving. At this point, Max Brödel, as the pioneer of medical illustration, built the applied, theoretical and artistic structure of the field with the various techniques he developed. With the increase in contemporary new media channels and the development of technologies, medical illustration has now started to gain a useful dimension within the possibilities of design-oriented graphic language. Based on all this information, as a result of the analyzes and examinations made with the content analysis method in the research article, it has been found that medical illustrations can turn into virtual data that can be touched or viewed in the future.

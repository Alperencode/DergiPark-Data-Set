Makale Başlığı: Screening of Y Chromosome Microdeletions and Cytogenetic Analysis in Infertile Men
Özet: In our study we aimed to demonstrate Y microdeletions with using sY254 sequence tagged sites (STS) marker in primary infertile male patients by using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method and determine the correlation between cyctogenetic evaluation of patients. Twenty five male patients referred from Manisa and it’s regions, who were diagnosed with primary infertility in the urology department of Manisa Celal Bayar University were included in our study. Thirteen individuals had azoospermia, twelve individuals had oligozoospermia. Ethics committee approval of our patients were recieved from Manisa Celal Bayar University. Blood material was taken under sterile conditions from individuals. Total DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. DNA purity was checked. Target gene regions of total DNA were amplified with PCR method by using oligonucleotide primers. sY14 STS marker used as internal control and pure water used as negative control. Cytogenetic study was made with lymphocyte cultures, human metaphase chromosomes were analysed with light microscopy. According to our analysis results no microdeletion was determined and all of the patients had normal karyotype (46, XY)

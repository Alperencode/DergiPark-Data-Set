Makale Başlığı: Characteristics of Some Turkish Lignites and Potential of Using in Agricultural Sector
Özet: Recently, a lotof progress have been obtain towards progress on the quality and quantity inagriculture. The advances and development in agriculture depend onmechanisation and the development on the soil characteristic which also help toincrease the product efficiency. This study aims todetermine some Turkish low rank coalsamples for applications in the agricultural sector and assesses thesuitability of a certain coal either as soil conditioner or as raw material formanufacturing organic fertilizers. Theyimprove the soil structure and improve physical properties of soil byincreasing the exchange capacity and buffening qualities, promoting thechelation of many elements and making these available to plants. Humicsubstances can ameliorate negative soil properties; improve the plant growthand nutrients uptake. Twenty-six samples of subbituminous coal obtained from several Turkishcoal deposits such as Arguvan,Çayırlı, Artova and Zile, Kangal-Gemerek-Divriği were studied. When optimum parameters were used, the most promising samples for utilization are the coalsamples from Arguvan, Artovaand Zile, since they yielded high HA contents (≥30 wt). Although the Artova and Arguvan samples display high HA contents, they are also richin S and release Fe, which might be threatening for the plants.

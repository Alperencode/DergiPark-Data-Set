Makale Başlığı: The Effects of the Addition of Dill Oil (Anethum graveolens) into Biodiesel-Diesel Blends
Özet: The effects of dill oil extract as an antioxidant on the crystallization properties of colza biodiesel were investigated. 3000 ppm dill oil (Anethum graveolens) was blended with colza biodiesel-diesel mixtures at certain rates. The chemical antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used to compare the effects. For this reason, the samples were prepared and called D100, B20D80, B20D80D, and B20D80BHT. The crystallization temperatures (Tcr) of the samples were determined by using a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) technique. The values of samples with antioxidants were decreased compared to the non-antioxidant biodiesel sample (B100). The order of antioxidant power wasD100for D100, B20D80, B20D80BHT and B20D80D were −11.3 7 °C, −13.42 °C, -14.94 °C, and −15.65 °C, respectively. The addition of dill oil extract as a natural antioxidant had a positive effect on biodiesel oxidative stability for 3000 ppm concentration. Natural dill oil showed a similar  efficiency with BHT that the synthetic chemical antioxidant. The dill oil can be used as an antioxidant after the complete standard fuel tests.

Makale Başlığı: On Fukuyama’s New Book ‘Liberalism and its Discontents’: What About The End of History?
Özet: Following the collapse of the Soviet Union works of Francis Fukuyama and Samuel P. Huntington presented approaches on how the World will go next. On the one hand, Fukuyama announces the victory of American Liberalism following the the collapse of the Soviet Union while on the other hand Huntington says that conflicts will continue on a cultural basis in the new period. Although two works seem to be opposite, both of them have constructed the ground for the American politics in the process. In his new work ‘Liberalism and its Discontents’ Fukuyama does not speak as confidently as in his previous work. He does not present Liberalism victorious rather he presents it as a cure for Liberation that we need to hug it tight. Yet, he had admitted contradictorily that conflicts on micro level will continue notwithstanding the victory of Liberalism. He shows Liberalism as a cure for today’s world in which conflicts still continue. However, the application of the cure does not seem possible in current sociological conditions.

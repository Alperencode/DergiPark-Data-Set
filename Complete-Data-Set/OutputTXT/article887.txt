Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Sport Team Evangelism (eFANgelism) Behaviors of Faculty of Sports Sciences Students
Özet: This research aimed to examine the sports team evangelism attitudes of undergraduate students studying at the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Universities in Turkey and to compare them in terms of some demographic variables. The sample group consists of 378 volunteer participants. The “Sports Team Evangelism (eFANgelism) Scale (STES)”, which was developed by Dwyer et al. (2015) and adapted into Turkish by Yüksekbilgili’s (2017) validity and reliability study, was used as a data collection tool, together with the form containing demographic information. The reliability level of the scale was determined by calculating the Cronbach’s Alpha internal consistency coefficient. Parametric test techniques were used in the analysis of the sample that showed a normal distribution. The findings showed that there was a significant difference in the total mean scores of STES in terms of gender, the team they supported, and the variables of the department they studied. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the monthly income of the family and age variable. The result of this research revealed that the students in the Faculty of Sport Sciences were in high efangelistic behaviors. In addition, it was determined that male students showed more efangelistic behaviors than female students.

Makale Başlığı: Examining the Relationship between Cognitive Flexibility and Well-Being (PERMA) in University Students: A Structural Equation Modeling
Özet: The aim of this study is to test a structural equation model consisting of cognitive flexibility and well-being (PERMA) variables in order to contribute to the explanation of well-being in university students. The research was conducted with 444 university students studying at two different universities. Three different measurement tools, namely Personal Information Form, Turkish version of PERMA Profiler and Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, were used to collect data within the scope of the study. According to the results of the study, it was found that there are positive and significant relationships between cognitive flexibility and total well-being (PERMA) scores of university students. In addition, research findings revealed that there are positive and significant relationships between cognitive flexibility scores and “positive emotions”, “engagement”, “positive relationships”, “meaning” and “accomplishment” sub-dimension scores that form the multi-dimensional structure of well-being. Moreover, with the findings of the study, it was concluded that cognitive flexibility is a significant predictor of well-being in university students. In conclusion, when the research results are evaluated as a whole, it can be said that preventive psycho-educational intervention studies aimed at improving cognitive flexibility will be useful in studies to be carried out to increase well-being.

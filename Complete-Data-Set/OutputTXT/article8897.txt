Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Fruit Residues as a Feed Material Based on Nutrient Content and Gas Production
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the nutrient content, gas production, methane production, metabolisable energy, and organic matter digestibility of some fruit residues obtained from markets. Lemon, orange, tangerine, apple, melon, watermelon, pomegranate, and pear were used as study materials. On the collected materials, crude ash (CA), dry matter (DM), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), ether extract (EE), and crude protein (CP) analysis were performed; gas production (GP) values were found; and metabolic energy (ME) contents and organic matter digestibility (OMD) degrees of residues were calculated depending on these values. The species significantly (P<0.001) affected the nutrient content and GP values of residues. The CA, DM, ADF, NDF, EE, and CP of fruit residues varied between 0.44 and 0.99%, 6.81 and 25.65%, 5.02 and 16.75%, 8.15 and 21.04%, 3.32 and 12.55%, and 1.81 and 10.89%, respectively. The GP, net methane, percentage of methane, ME, and OMD of residues varied between 61.22 and 90.95 ml, 6.93 to 11.04 ml, 10.96 to 12.92%, 10.91 to 14.92 mj kg-1 DM, and 72.62 to 98.96%, respectively. Based on the findings obtained as a result of the study, it is understood that these residues can be a good feed source for ruminant animals, but it is thought that studies on the use of these water-rich residues by both the drying method and silage with other feed materials should continue. Considering its anti-methanogenic properties, pomegranate residues were close to this potential but were not found at the desired level. By using these residues, which are seen as garbage, in animal nutrition, environmental pollution will be prevented.

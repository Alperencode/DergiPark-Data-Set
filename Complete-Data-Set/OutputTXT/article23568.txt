Makale Başlığı: EVALUATING GENDER RESPONSIVE BUDGETING IN TURKEY
Özet: Women are disadvantaged in comparison to males in terms of economic, social, and political equality. Arguments for adding gender budgeting in budget programs and policies are based on the idea of externality. The previous experience with "gender budgeting" necessitates a thorough examination of gender concerns within the budget. In this method, public finances play a significant role in eradicating gender discrimination. Gender-based budgeting should be integrated into budgetary procedures to yield real changes in policy results in order to become more valuable in the process. Many governments throughout the world are currently attempting to introduce gender-based legislation. This study fills a gap in the GRB literature by providing information regarding the GRB procedure and budgetary arrangements. It also investigates the link between GRB and gender mainstreaming, emphasizing the influence of policies that must be enacted.

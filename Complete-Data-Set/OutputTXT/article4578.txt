Makale Başlığı: Tracing Change and Continuity in History Textbooks of the Republican Period in Turkey: The Case of the Union and Progress Society
Özet: According to the generally accepted approach, the Union and Progress Society, which was established as a secret society by a group of military medical students in Istanbul in 1889, left its mark on the events that developed in the last ten years of the Ottoman Empire. The Society also played a role in the organization of the National Struggle and became an important figure in domestic politics, albeit for a short time, during the Republican period. The document analysis method was used in this survey model, which aims to reveal the change in the approach to the Union and Progress Society and unionists in the history textbooks taught in high schools in the Republican era in Turkey. History and the History of the Republic of Turkey (and the History of the Turkish Republic Revolution and Kemalism) textbooks taught in high schools in Turkey between 1931 and 2020 were used as the main material in the research. In this regard, the research was carried out on a sample of 20 textbooks thought to represent the research period. The data obtained in the research were analyzed with descriptive analysis, which is a qualitative data analysis technique, and the findings were evaluated by considering the categories created. As a result of the research, it is understood that the framework and approach to the issues related to the Union and Progress Society in the Republican period were determined in the History textbooks published in 1931, and as a reflection of the internal political developments of the period, the negative approach towards the Committee of Union and Progress in these textbooks gradually weakened and the subjects diversified as they approached the present day. It is possible to say that the opposition between the Republican staff and the Unionists, which was generally felt in the 1931 textbooks, gave way to the Ottoman-Unionist opposition to a certain extent as the 2000s approached

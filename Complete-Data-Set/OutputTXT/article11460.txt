Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Silvicultural Practices in Kütahya Region Forest Fire Areas
Özet: Silvicultural practices of fire areas that were prioritized in afforestation with the relevant suggestions were studied in three sampled areas, which of each 1000 m² burned in 2007, forested by Anatolian black pine [Pinus nigra Arnold. subsp. pallasiana (Lamb.) Holmboe]. The areas sampled from Kütahya forest district were examined based on height, diameter at base, and age. Averages of height, diameter at base and age were 221.3 cm, 6.7 cm and 8.8 years, while numbers of trees were 189, 204 and 323 in sampled areas. Result of analysis of variance showed significant differences at 99% among the sampled areas for the characteristics. However, the areas were more heterogenous for height than diameter and age by Duncan’s multiple range test. Positive and significant correlations (p<0.01) were found among the characteristics by results of correlation analysis in the areas (r>0.52) and their total (r>0.37). Results of the study showed that silvicultural practices were well accordance for sustainable forestry purposes to contribute forestry practices such as fire culture.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF THE 4MAT TEACHING MODEL IN TEACHING PROBABILITY SUBJECTS BY DATA ANALYSIS ON THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL 8TH STUDENTS AND THE STABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE
Özet: The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of using the 4MAT teaching model in teaching probability subjects through data analysis on the academic achievement and retention of knowledge of 8th grade secondary school students. The study group of the research consisted of 8th grade students studying in two village schools located in the central district of a province in the south of Turkey. The research was carried out with a total of 64 students, 21 of whom were in the Experimental 1, 21 in the Experimental 2 and 22 in the Control group. The quasi-experimental design model with pretest posttest control group was used in the research. During the research, the experimental groups were taught with the 4MAT teaching model, while the control group was taught a teaching stipulated by the curriculum. As a data collection tool, "Probability Achievement Test with Data Analysis" consisting of 20 multiple-choice questions prepared by the researcher was used. In the analysis of the data obtained from the achievement test, the SPSS 22 package program was used and the result of covariance analysis (ANCOVA) was examined. When the data obtained as a result of ANCOVA analysis were examined, it was seen that there was a significant difference between the academic achievement point averages of the experimental groups in which the 4MAT teaching model was applied, in favor of the experimental groups, compared to the average achievement score of the control group, which was taught with the method prescribed by the mathematics course curriculum. Similarly, it was observed that the permanence test scores of the experimental groups created a statistically significant difference compared to the permanence test scores of the control group.

Makale Başlığı: ATTITUDES TOWARDS MIGRANTS LIVING IN TURKEY: THE EXAMPLE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
Özet: Any physical movement that an individual or group performs towards different regions by leaving the region where they live for various reasons is considered within the scope of migration.  Turkey, in terms of both its strategic position and sociological, cultural and religious position, sometimes appears as a transit country in the migration process and sometimes as a place of migration.  In recent years, these migration movements are seen especially as external migration and irregular immigrant. Within the scope of the study, the attitudes of 386 university students studying at associate and undergraduate degrees in foundation and state universities in Turkey are explained according to some demographic variables, and whether university students are uncomfortable with the presence of immigrants is described and the social profile of university students is drawn. Documentation and relational scanning methods were used together as a method in the research and the questionnaire technique was used. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the survey text was delivered to university students online. By using the snowball sampling method, a number of sample groups representing the universe were reached. As a result of the study, it has been concluded that university students are disturbed by immigrants, the immigrants they feel most uncomfortable with are immigrants from Afghan, Syria, Iraq and Iran, and the immigrants they are least disturbed by are immigrants from Western Europe. In addition, while attitudes towards immigrants did not change according to gender, it was observed that those with high religious attitudes, those who spent most of their lives in villages and those who studied at a state university had more positive attitudes towards immigrants.

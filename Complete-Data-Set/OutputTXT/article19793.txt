Makale Başlığı: Use of mindfulness applications with virtual reality applications in nursing
Özet: Virtual reality (VR) has recently been used as a tool to support awareness. When the literature is examined, no national or international studies have been found to transfer awareness practices to nursing practices as virtual reality applications. VR technologies beneficially address the challenges of environmental distraction by providing an immersive, engaging and controlled visual and auditory virtual space where attention skills can be experienced. It has been reported that the mindfulness-based stress reduction program with VR applications is used to reduce stress and anxiety, regain attention, increase anxiety and fear, and treat post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorder and pain. VR technologies have made mental health interventions more accessible to the wider public. VR mindfulness is a new research area in the field of nursing. Therefore, it seems that more research is needed on this topic to understand the processes related to awareness in VR and other digital applications. The purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between VR of mindfulness stress reduction programs and nursing practices.

Makale Başlığı: Omega 3 Yağ Asitlerinin COVID-19 Üzerine Etkileri
Özet: Recently, the novel coronavirus, which is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has been responsible for the highly rapid spread of COVID-19 disease, globally. Until now, 535 million people were affected and 6.3 million people died due to this outbreak throughout the World. Although the lethality of this disease is lower than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe complications of this disease are attributed to “cytokine storm” that is the reason for the severe lung damage. The cytokine storm causes systemic inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, stroke, multiple organ dysfunction, and death. As a result of these symptoms, there are pivotal studies about vaccination, drug, and medication to prevent severe complications and treat patients with COVID-19. Besides these studies, some research shows that nutrients are able to manage the cytokine storm such as many types of vitamins, trace elements, and omega 3 fatty acids. Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have specific roles in the inflammatory process. Omega 3 fatty acids have a role in the improvement of the inflammatory balance. They interact with viral infection in disparate stages such as viral entry and replication. This study highlights the roles of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19. In addition, omega 3 fatty acids show anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and increase survival rates in patients infected with COVID-19.

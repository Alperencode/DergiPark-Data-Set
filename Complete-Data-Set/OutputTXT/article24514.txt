Makale Başlığı: THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE LACK OF A CYBER-CONFLICT DEFINITION
Özet: This article aims in the first place, to answer why a general definition of cyber-conflicts isneeded. To do so, it explores the reasons why it has not been possible to create a generaldefinition for this term and what have been the implications of this lack. Among the causesof not having a general definition for the term of “cyber-conflict” it can be found the lack ofclarity and rigor in the use of this term and the definition of other terms related to cyberspacethat might be confused with each other. In order to better understand the closestapproaches to the meaning and definition of what cyber-conflict is, the first part of this paperexposes several definitions of key terms surrounding the concept of “cyber”. The second partof the article shows the relationship between the lack of international organizations thatregulate or give guidelines regarding cyber-space and the lack of a universal definition ofcyber-conflict. The third and last part presents three relevant cases that demonstrate therecent importance of the cyber-space at the state level, its relationship with cyber-conflictsand how the lack of a universal framework prevents a solution to these type of conflicts.After the analysis, the main conclusion of the study is that a universal definition of the termcyber-conflict is required in order to set a framework that allows the development ofregulation measurements towards this new threat that the cyber-space has brought.

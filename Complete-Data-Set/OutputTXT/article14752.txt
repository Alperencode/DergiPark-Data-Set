Makale Başlığı: URBAN HISTORIOGRAPHY AND REFLECTIONS IN TÜRKİYE
Özet: Cities are the most important witnesses of the social, political, economic and administrative changes that occur in a society. In fact, cities are like the memory of the geography where one lives. In general, the first studies on the history of the city started in the West. In Türkiye, the studies on the history of the city took place much later. While urban history is developing as a discipline in Europe, studies on this subject in Türkiye are still very new. It has even been a matter of debate whether the history of the city is a science or not. Despite all this, there are historians who have pioneered studies on this subject in recent times. In this study, the reflections of the urban history studies that started in Europe in the later period in Türkiye are emphasized.

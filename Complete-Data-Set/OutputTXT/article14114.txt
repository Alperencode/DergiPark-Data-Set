Makale Başlığı: GREEN FINANCE FROM SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE
Özet: The concept of sustainable development, which constitutes the common denominator of economic and social development, requires respecting the acquired rights of future generations. Sustainable development, which was first mentioned only because of ecological concerns, has turned into an effort to express socio-economic developments together with environmental problems. The green transformation efforts initiated in this direction are increasing and being supported day by day. The financing of these studies also constitutes a significant issue. From this point of view, with this study, the concept of green finance in the perspective of sustainable development has been tried to be expressed in a general framework. In addition, due diligence has been made regarding the applicability of green finance in Turkey. The study is original in terms of considering green finance from the perspective of sustainable development and the determinations in question, and contributes to the literature.

Makale Başlığı: A RARE CASE OF CHONDROBLASTOMA OF THE ACROMION
Özet: We describe an unusual case involving a 37-year-old patient with a chondroblastoma in his right acromion. The acromion is a very rare site for this type of tumor and the typical surgical treatment involves resection of the involved acromion bone. The patient was surgically treated by resection of the right acromion and autogenous iliac bone grafting to restore shoulder motion. Twenty five months postoperatively, he demonstrated full shoulder function, without evidence of local recurrence or metastasis. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0253This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

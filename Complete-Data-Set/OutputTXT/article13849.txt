Makale Başlığı: LEGAL STRUCTURE, ACTIVITIES, AND PROTECTION OF STAKEHOLDERS OF SAVINGS FINANCE JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES
Özet: Savings finance joint-stock companies engage in activities similar to banking, such as collecting money from a large number of people and financing the collec-ted money with their own unique methods. However, until 2021, no legal arran-gements have been made to protect the stakeholders who trust these companies and invest their savings, and give companies a corporate character. In this study, just basic information, about the saving-based financing system is given, and the main subject of the study is financial saving companies.  In this context, as a joint-stock company, legal regulations about savings-based financing companies will be examined. The new regulation necessitated the establishment of these institutions as joint-stock companies. In this sense, the establishment, manage-ment, and activities of the companies will be examined and compared with the Turkish Commercial Code and the Banking Law. Protection of stakeholders is of great importance in savings finance joint-stock companies. Therefore, the regula-tions regarding the protection of the financial structure of the companies, their liquidation, and liability problems will also be examined.

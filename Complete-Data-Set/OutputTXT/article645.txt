Makale Başlığı: Shadowing Death in Language: Euphemisms on Death in Safâyî's Tezkire
Özet: Language, which is a multidimensional communication channel, offers individuals various opportunities to express themselves. The euphemism which is defined as the preference of different words that refer to these words instead of words that are not welcomed to be uttered directly in social life, and that, when expressed, evoke fear and negative connotations, is a language use that allows individuals to express themselves more freely in terms of social and psychological aspects. This use, which is common in areas such as sexuality, illness, death, etc., is directly related to many dynamics, especially norms and acceptances, belief system, psychology. Death, which has deeply affected humanity both socially and psychologically since its existence, aroused fear and curiosity, and whose mystery has not been solved for centuries, is one of the areas where euphemisms are heavily preferred. The euphemisms that are preferred in this field for reasons such as mitigating the psychological destruction caused by death, and suspending the concept of death, distract those who are left behind from fear and anxieties about death. The euphemisms about death in the tezkires of Safâyî Mustafa Efendi, one of the important representatives of our tradition of tezkire, called Nuhbetü'l-Âsâr min Fevâdi'l-Eş’âr, which he wrote in the first quarter of the XVIII century, constitute the basis of this study. While giving information about the death of the poets who are the subject of the tezkires, the harmony of the style with the tradition was examined, and by including the euphemisms about death in today's society, it was discussed how the approach of the society to the phenomenon of death changed and was shaped in the process.

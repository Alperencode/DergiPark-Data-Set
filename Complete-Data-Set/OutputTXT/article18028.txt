Makale Başlığı: Epicardial adipose tissue thickness in adult patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever as a predictor of coronary artery disease
Özet: Aim: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), is a chronic auto-inflammatory disease characterized with recurrent attacks. In between attacks, subclinical inflammation persists which results in increased risk of atherosclerosis. Epicardial adipose tissue is a novel cardiometabolic risk factor which predicts the risk of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to measure the epicardial adipose tissue thickness (EATT) and to evaluate the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with FMF.Materials and Methods: 18 years old and older FMF patients diagnosed according to Tel-Hashomer criteria and age and sex matched healthy individuals were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Disease characteristics, gene mutations, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid-A, fibrinogen, lipid levels and complete blood counts were recorded at the time of inclusion. EATT was measured by a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. A p value <0.05 was accepted as significant.Results: A total of 50 FMF patients (58% female) and 50 healthy controls (54%female) were involved in the study (p=0.69). The median age of healthy controls were 45 years and FMF patients were 33 years which were statistically insignificant (p=0.13) Epicardial adipose tissue was statistically significantly higher in FMF patients (5,4 mm [4,7-5,8]) in comparison to healthy controls (3,0 mm [2,8-3,2]) (p<0.001). There were no correlations between EATT and inflammatory markers. The ROC analysis to predict the best cut-off value for EATT showed 4 mm with a sensitivity of 86%, specificity 94%, positive likelihood ratio 14.3 and Youden Index 0.80 (AUC:0.962, 95%CI 0.924-0.999, p≤0.001)Conclusion: EATT is significantly higher in FMF patients compared to healthy individuals which results in increased cardiovascular risk in FMF. The measurement of epicardial adipose tissue with echocardiography is a practical, cheap and an accurate method. Determining the atherosclerotic risk in the early stages of the disease may reduce long-term mortality and morbidity in FMF patients.

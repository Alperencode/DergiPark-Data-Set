Makale Başlığı: TRADE OPENNESS AND INDUSTRIAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION NEXUS IN TURKEY
Özet: Trade openness, which expresses how flexible and easy or how rigid and problematic the commercial relations of countries with the outside world are, is examined from different perspectives in the economics literature, especially with the globalization process that has increased at an increasing pace since the beginning of the 90s.  Although most of the studies seem to gather around the aim of revealing the causal relationship between trade openness and growth, there are studies on many different subjects in the literature. On the other hand, it is seen that the analysis of trade openness on a regional basis remains very limited in both national and international literature. This study, it is aimed to contribute to the literature by investigating a correlation between the trade openness obtained from 12 statistical regions in Turkey and the amount of energy consumed in the industrial sector. To achieve this aim, the effect of trade openness on the energy consumption of the industrial sector has been examined with annual data and a random-effects model for the 2015-2019 period. As a result of the random-effects model, it has been reached that the increases in trade openness in Turkey increase the energy consumption in the industry.

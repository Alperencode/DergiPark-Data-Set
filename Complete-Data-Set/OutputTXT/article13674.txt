Makale Başlığı: A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF TEMPERAMENT
Özet: This study is a review article and aims to examine the historical development process of equaltemperament, known as the tuning system of piano and fixed-fretted instruments. Temperament is brieflydefined as changing musical intervals from their counterparts in the natural (Just Intonation) scale at certainrates. As of the end of the 1300s, it is known that most keyboard instruments were tempered. The first methoddescribed in writing is the temperament called “mean-tone”. In this method, importance was given to thethirds being natural or close to nature, on the other hand, the fifths were slightly lowered. In the mean-tonetemperament, some intervals which are excessively high or low and the presence of unusable scales has ledto the emergence of irregular temperaments. Although there are more than one interval with the same namein irregular temperaments, this method has been applied to keyboard instruments for about two centuries,since all scales can be used. Even when using mean-tone temperament and irregular temperament, theimportance and necessity of equal temperament has always been a subject advocated by theorists. Thoughequal temperament began to be practiced on fretted instruments in the 1570s, it was accepted much later inkeyboard instruments. The cent system, which was introduced by Alexander J. Ellis in 1876, is a turning point inthe calculation of equal temperament. With the spread of 12-tone music in international art music in the 20thcentury, unequal temperaments came to an end, and it was accepted as a common tuning system for keyboardand fretted instruments.

Makale Başlığı: Learning Mathematics in Distance Education through Students’ Eyes: Sentiment Analysis
Özet: Countries implemented a variety of measures with education policy during the Covid-19 epidemic so that distance education has become compulsory all over the world. Many countries have endeavored to conduct more qualified online education as a result of this need. The purpose of this study is to use metaphors to identify students’ perspectives of mathematics learning in distance education. It is also aimed to reveal the relationship of metaphors with emotional loads and the variables of teaching approach, mathematics self-efficacy and computer self-efficacy. Survey model, which is one of the descriptive research approaches, was employed in this study and a total of 201 elementary school students from various regions of Turkey participated to the study. Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) assessed the emotional load of the metaphors. With one-way ANOVA analysis conducted using metaphor classification, it was examined whether the teaching approach, mathematics self-efficacy and computer self-efficacy scores created a significant difference in the context of the relevant classifications. Student opinions were subjected to content analysis. Assuming that distance education will become an integral part of our lives in the future, it is anticipated that the findings of this study will provide important insights into the elements that should be included in the platforms where teaching will take place, as well as the requirements of the learning environment.

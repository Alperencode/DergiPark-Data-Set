Makale Başlığı: FAILURE MODE AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS (FMEA): INSTANT ERROR AND CONDITION MONITORING IN MANUFACTURING
Özet: FMEA method was applied in the machining workshop of a company that manufactures industrial kitchen products and has hundreds of main products and thousands of semi-finished products in its product range. With PLC cards placed in 12 machines in the workshop, the status of the machine, product and production were monitored instantly. With the help of PLC cards placed in the machines, the data were recorded on the central computer, valid data about the operation of the machines were obtained. The operating status of the machines with the data received from the cards inserted into the machines, that is, capacity usage times, working times of machines, waiting times in tightening only for horizontal lathe machines, idle waiting, working times, downtimes were obtained. In line with the data obtained, FMEA method was applied in the enterprise; the most common error types were determined, and preventive and corrective actions were applied for those with a RÖS value greater than 100. In addition to the main study, cutting tool costs, which are the most expensive item for machining companies, were examined, and production costs from January, when FMEA was not used, and February and March, when it was used, were compared and evaluated.

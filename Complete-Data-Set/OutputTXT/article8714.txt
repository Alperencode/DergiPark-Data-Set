Makale Başlığı: Effect of Energy Restriction on Lifespan via Sirtuins: SIRT1 and SIRT3
Özet: Sirtuin protein family, the homologue of the yeast Sir2 protein in the mammalian organism, consists of 7 members (SIRT1-7). Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), which has the highest Sir2 similarity, draws attention due to the positive effects of its activation on metabolism. The different localizations of sirtuins in the cell cause diversity in their functions, providing a wide range of effects from energy homeostasis to DNA repair mechanisms. The first discovered regulator of sirtuins was cellular NAD molecule. As a result of the organism’s exposure to less energy intake than normal, this restriction causes the NAD+/ NADH ratio in the cell to change in favor of NAD+. This new balance has been found to be associated with prolonged lifespan as a result of increased sirtuin activation in organisms at all levels, from yeasts to mammals. After the deacetylation functions were discovered, sirtuins were also referred to as ‘NAD-dependent deacetylase’. Despite being often limited to deacetylate lysine residues of histone proteins in lower organisms, sirtuins have a wide variety of protein targets in the mammalian organism. The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of the importance of sirtuin proteins that can be induced by dietary changes and to summarize the effects of SIRT1 and SIRT3, which stand out with their positive metabolic functions, on metabolism through some target substrates.

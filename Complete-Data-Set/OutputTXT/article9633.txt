Makale Başlığı: DESIGN OPTIMIZATION of a BRACKET PLATE for an AMMUNITION FEED MECHANISM of a MEDIUM CALIBER CANNON
Özet: Topology optimization has been one of the major concerns for mechanical engineers over the years. With increasing utilization of the finite element method, mechanical analyses can be done easily these days and their results are quite reliable. In weapon systems, high loads act on system components. Due to high loads, every component must be designed to operate without any failure. While designing them, attention must be given in order to avoid excessive weights. So, topology optimization is needed in weapon system components. In this study, design with topology optimization of a bracket plate of an ammunition feed mechanism were investigated using the finite element method. By utilizing topology optimization concept, the dimensions, material and the number of mounting holes of the bracket plate of an ammunition feed mechanism were changed to see their effects on the elemental Von-Mises stress and nodal displacement values. The results show that the increase in mounting hole number and the thickness of the material with selecting a material having higher strength properties decreases the elemental Von-Mises stress and nodal displacement values. According to the results, a safer bracket plate for an ammunition feed mechanism was designed to operate in the given working conditions without any failures.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of the Effect of Board Game and Tobacco Cessation Education on Nicotine Addiction in Adolescent Smokers
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a board game and tobacco cessation education on nicotine addiction in adolescent smokers.Material and Methods: This randomized controlled study included 103 adolescents who declared to smoke at least one cigarette per day. For data collection, sociodemographic data form, Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, and stages of change scale were used. The study groups consisted of three intervention groups; board game, tobacco cessation education, and the combined use of these two interventions, and a control group. All interventions were compared with the control group. Follow-ups were conducted at baseline, 8th, and 12th week.Results: While 38.8% (n=40) of all participants were addicted to nicotine at a very low level, 6.8% (n=7) were very high. 37.9% (n=39) of the participants reported smoking the first cigarette of the day within the first 5 minutes. Groups had an effect on the nicotine addiction level of adolescents (p=0.031), while there was no significant difference for the period, and period*group interaction (p=0.472 and p=0.339, respectively). The difference was due to the board game group. In the post evaluation, three of the adolescents who played board games and two of the adolescents who received tobacco cessation training were in the action phase.Conclusion: The results showed that the board game group participants had a decrease in the level of nicotine addiction. Our suggestion is to use and disseminate games as an alternative method that will attract the attention of adolescents in tobacco cessation education.

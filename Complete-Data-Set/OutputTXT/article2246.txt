Makale Başlığı: Gastronomy Museums as a Formation Element of Local Gastronomic Identity: The case of Safranbolu Turkish Coffee Museum
Özet: This study aims to show the importance of gastronomic museums in forming a local gastronomic identity with the case study of Safranbolu Turkish Coffee Museum. The scope of the study was Safranbolu Turkish Coffee Museum and the objects and services hosted by the museum. The museum's region, the museum building, the museum materials, and the folkloric and anthropological meanings of the services it offers were examined through museum tour observations and museum employee narratives. In addition to the primary sources, interviews given by the museum founders and employees to local and national media platforms were used. The effects of the guests' experience and comments on gastronomic identity were determined by analysing the social media platforms. Many assets that have local, national and transnational meanings in the museum have been presented by a modern presentation in a traditional building. These kindsg of museums are a tool for preserving the existing cultural heritage transferring it to future generations and providing the opportunity for local and foreign tourists to experience food and beverage experiences.

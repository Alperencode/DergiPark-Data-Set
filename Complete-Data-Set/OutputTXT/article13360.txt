Makale Başlığı: Distance learning in interpreter training: A survey on student perspective
Özet: This study aims to explore the student perspective in interpreter training by distance learning mode at a state university in Turkey during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey consisting of three sections was conducted. Participants were junior and senior students enrolled in Translation and Interpreting undergraduate program and who had taken online interpreting classes. The results show that while some advantages are favored by students such as watching recorded classes later, most students do not like attending online interpreting classes because they find these classes ‘boring’, harder to focus on and do not think these classes help their overall interpreting classes. Although technical problems are mostly eliminated with the help of advancements in communication and information technologies, some inherent problems surrounding distance learning such as attention deficiency remain intact. Following a brief literature review, the present paper provides the student perspective on distance learning in interpreter training and based on the findings, puts forth ways for further research.

Makale Başlığı: Seyhler Mosque in Isparta-Senirkent
Özet: In this study, the Şeyhler Mosque of the Ottoman Period, located in the Senirkent District of Isparta, will be discussed and introduced. The founder of the mosque, which is understood to have been built in 1854, is unknown. The mosque, which has a rectangular plan, is covered with a wooden flat ceiling from the inside and a hipped roof from the outside. In general, decorations are encountered on the south wall and mihrab of the mosque, which is kept simple in terms of decoration. Although it is claimed that the mosque was built in the 16th century, considering today's architectural and ornamental features, it can be argued that it has the characteristics of the 19th century period. For this reason, it is understood that many repairs and additions were made to the mosque in the following years. The mosque was registered in 2008 by the Antalya Cultural and Natural Heritage Conservation Regional Board and received protection. In 2022, the restoration and restitution projects of the mosque were prepared by “Hekart Architecture Office”. By examining the plan, materials, and decorations of the building in detail, it will be tried to reveal both the mosques in the surrounding towns, towns, and villages and their place and importance in Anatolian Turkish Art. The mosque, which is thought to have been built in the second half of the 19th century, is closed to worship today.

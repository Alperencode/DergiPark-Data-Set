Makale Başlığı: Chasing Television Memory: A Narrative of Television Era in Turkey
Özet: This study attempts to provide a socio-cultural historiography of television in Turkey that addresses how people experience television in everyday life, as a social and cultural tool, and how it is integrated into the social development process. Unlike media history studies in this field, the history of television in Turkey is examined in this study along with the process of social development, and the history of television is handled through everyday activities. In this setting, first-person accounts of watching television that were gathered from in-depth interviews with Turkish television viewers during the field study were combined with news and media texts from the era's newspapers and magazines that covered the start of television broadcasting. As a result of the study, a cultural-historical narrative about television in Turkey as a social experience emerged.

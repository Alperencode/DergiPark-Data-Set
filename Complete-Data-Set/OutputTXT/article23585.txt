Makale Başlığı: A Contrastive Study on Motion Events: Encoding Manner and Path Information in English and Turkish
Özet: Leonard Talmy’s typology divides languages into two categories; satellite-framed and verb-framedlanguages. This paper, by focusing on the typological tendencies of the languages, examines English (s-framedlanguage) and Turkish (v-framed language) motion verbs. The analysis is divided into four main questions whichfocus on the typology, manner encoding, and function of adverbs. Data, comprised of 360 motion verbs from tennovels in total, is analysed quantitatively to find an answer to the research questions. The results show thatEnglish and Turkish behave accordingly within the typology. However, the most significant finding is thatTurkish can encode Manner information as much as English despite previous claims through alternativemediums, subordinated motion verbs, and adverbial expressions while employing the former more frequently.

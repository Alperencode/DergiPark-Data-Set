Makale Başlığı: Analysis of Turkey's International Trade Policy via the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization with Structural Break
Özet: Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization (BSEC) is an organization established in 1992 under the leadership of Turkey and aims to develop economic, technical and scientific cooperation of member countries.  Countries in the region are signing agreements with each other in different fields as well as participating in regional partnerships in order to put their sensitive relationship on a stronger foundation for collaboration due to historical factors. In this study, Turkey's relations with the BSEC member countries were examined and all export and import variables of Turkey and the BSEC members were calculated by taking the logarithmic equivalents of their annual values in dollars. In this study, it has been examined whether the effects of the agreements that constitute the infrastructure of Turkey's trade with the BSEC member countries are reflected in Turkey's foreign trade with these countries. For this purpose, the export and import series of Turkey towards the BSEC member countries were obtained by taking the logarithmic equivalents of their annual dollar values. Unit root (ADF) and structural break tests (Perron) were applied to the obtained series. According to the test results, examples of countries that created a structural break in the foreign trade series of the agreements forming the trade infrastructure were discussed.

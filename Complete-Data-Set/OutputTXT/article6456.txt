Özet: Cities have always been considered a changing and transforming concept in the historical process. It is seen that the changes in the cities increase the environmental problems. Determining these problems through human emotions can guide the professional disciplines that plan, design, and develop the city. In the study, the environmental features of the streets and the emotions that these features make are discussed. The reasons for the positive and negative emotions that people feel during their street experiences in the Akyazı District of Ordu city center are examined and their relationship with environmental characteristics is examined. This study, which differs in the way that problems and satisfaction are determined clearly by the analyzes made, aims to reveal the results visually by measuring environmental problems or satisfaction over the feelings felt. The socio-demographic information obtained and the answers to the visual survey questions were analyzed in SPSS and GIS environment, and a word cloud analysis was carried out through the MAXQDA program to identify the problems. According to the analysis, the relationship between positive/negative emotions and environmental factors has been revealed.

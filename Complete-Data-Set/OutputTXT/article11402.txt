Makale Başlığı: MRI Evaluation of Anterolateral Ligament and Associated Lesions of the Knee
Özet: Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the anatomy of the anterolateral ligament (ALL), ALL injuries and the relationship between ALL injuries and other knee ligaments injuries, meniscal tears, bone injuries by retrospectively scanning patients’ knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods: Our study was designed as a retrospective, non-randomized, and single-center clinical study. We included knee MR images of 320 patients who applied to our tertiary care institution and underwent knee MRI between August 2021 and March 2022.Results: A total 320 knee MRI’s [female;163 (50.9%), mean age; 39.60±14.16 years, range; 21-77 years, left knee; 172 (53.7%)] were included study. At least one component of ALL was visualized in 319 (99.7%) cases [whole components: 276 (86.3%), meniscal: 311 (97.2%), femoral: 314 (98.1%), tibial: 280 (87.5%)]. Of the 182 ALL-injured knee, 182 (100%) had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, 116 (63.7%) had lateral meniscal injury, and 103 (56.6%) had bone injury. ACL (p=0.001), lateral meniscus (p=0.001), and bone injury (p=0.001) were more frequently in ALL-injured as compared with ALL-intact knee. Conclusion: There is a statistically significant relationship between acute ACL rupture, lateral meniscus, bone injury, and ALL injury. When evaluating MRI in patients with ACL, lateral meniscus, and bone injury, ALL evaluation should also be performed.

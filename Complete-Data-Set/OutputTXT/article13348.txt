Makale Başlığı: Dancing Atoms on the Brink of Fancy: The Concept of Materialism in Margaret Cavendish’s “Atomic Poems”
Özet: As one of the most prolific and eccentric female figures of the seventeenth century, Margaret Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle (1623-1673), managed to write and publish a great number of literary works in the male-dominated literary world of the time. Despite all the obstacles, her outrageous imagination stimulates her to step into the field of science which was not seen as suitable for women writers. Especially, drawing on the interest in atomism and materialism that were revived by the philosophers and scientists of the seventeenth century, Cavendish presents her own understanding of the universe based on two inseparable terms, “matter” and “motion.” While employing some of the terminology of atomism, matter and motion in particular, she uses her fancy, natural wit, rather than scientific theory because for her, fancy, which is used as a strategy by Cavendish in writing her works, is related to the physical movements in her mind and is, thus, “material.” As atoms embody vitalism, Cavendish chooses them as a theme in her “Atomic Poems” to show her “vitalist materialism” and by presenting them as a metaphor of her female self, she manifests herself in the male-dominated scientific and literary world. The aim of this paper is, thus, to examine Margaret Cavendish’s “Atomic Poems” in Poems, and Fancies (1653), in relation to how she employs atomism, in the way she perceives, and introduces a new theory of matter, which will set light to new materialism coined in the second half of the  1990s, with a fanciful manner.

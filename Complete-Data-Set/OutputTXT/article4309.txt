Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF LONELINESS IN THE WORKPLACE ON THE INTENTION TO LEAVE: AN APPLICATION ON SEAFARERS
Özet: Workplace loneliness refers to the feeling of deprivation that occurs as a result of the negative difference between the relationships that are tried to be reached and the existing relationships. The individual may feel the loneliness of the workplace by feeling the lack of a close and secure relationship as a result of the distancing and exclusion he/she may experience in the work environment. This feeling of loneliness can create the intention of leaving the job in the individual by weakening employees' commitment to the organization. From this point of view, the aim of the study is to determine the effect of workplace loneliness on the intention to quit in the emotional deprivation and social companionship sub-dimensions. For the specified purpose, data were collected from 418 Turkish seafarers operating in international sea transport through a questionnaire. The hypotheses of the study were tested by multiple linear regression analysis. As a result of the study, it was determined that emotional deprivation affects the intention to quit, and the social companionship dimension does not have an effect on the intention to quit.

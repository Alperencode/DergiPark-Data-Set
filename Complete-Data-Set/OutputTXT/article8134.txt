Makale Başlığı: Islamic Art History (Geschichte der Islamischen Kunst). Lorenz Korn. trans. Feride Kurtulmuş. İstanbul: Runik Publishing, 2020.
Özet: Lorenz Korn's research-examination work touches upon fundamental issues such as the nature of Islamic art, its development in different geographies, and its relationship with Antiquity. It focuses on the prohibition of depiction in Islam and its aspects that differ from the iconoclasm movement. As a result, it draws attention to its reflection in many fields from calligraphy to book arts and other decorative arts. One of the discussion-focused points of the work is that it establishes the idea of the original source of tile and miniature arts on the Far East-Chinese civilization. The work deals with the different aspects of Muslim art, which is performed in many fields and geographies, including architecture, decorative arts and modern Islamic art.

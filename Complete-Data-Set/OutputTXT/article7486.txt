Makale Başlığı: Dredged Sediments are One of the Valuable Resources: A Review
Özet: Worldwide, the preservation of non-renewable resources and recycling waste materials in the potential applications are gaining global attention. In this context, rigorous research studies focus on finding solutions to reuse and recycle various waste materials. Among the different types of waste materials, the dredged sediments are one of the valuable resources having potential to replenish the depletion of natural resources by reusing and recycling as secondary raw material in various applications. The process of sediments dredging is an essential and routine activity for ports and harbors to maintain sustainable navigation systems in the sea and river environment; on the other hand, continuous accumulation of contaminated dredged sediment harms the environment, ecology, and marine ecosystems. Managing the dredging process and dredged sediment is a fundamentally important aspect of marine and river ecosystems. The technology development to recycle dredged sediments as secondary raw materials can supplement natural resources and it would be a viable solution to eliminate environmental pollution, alleviate the problem of land scarcity for waste dumping, and partially can meet the demand of resource gap. This article presents the state of the art of recycling and valorization opportunities of dredged sediments, which leads to replenishing the depletion of natural resources and increasing global sustainability.

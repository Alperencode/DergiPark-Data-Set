Makale Başlığı: Impact of Peace on Gender Equality:  The Case of European Union Member States
Özet: This study investigates the impact of peacefulness on gender equality by employing panel data analysis. The study uses the Gender Inequality Index (GII) as a dependent variable and Global Peace Index (GPI) as an independent variable. The sample of the study covers 25 European Union Member States for the period of 2010-2019. The study found that increasing levels of peace have an impact on decreasing levels of gender inequality. The result suggests that peace is a determining variable in gender equality and complements the literature that reveals the positive impact of gender equality on peace levels of countries. This result points out the transformative relationship between peace and gender equality.

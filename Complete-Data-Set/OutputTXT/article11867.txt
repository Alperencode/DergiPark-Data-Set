Makale Başlığı: Migrant Councils as a Reflection of the Intercultural Approach to Social Integration
Özet: Social integration emerges as one of the problematic issues that are discussed more than ever in today’s conditions. Especially in the recent period as a result of the acceleration and differentiation of migration, there have been some developments which challenge the actors of the global world. Various migration experiences, which take place in unique conditions, cause states to increase their political and administrative burdens and search for solutions. One of the actors sharing this burden is the migrant councils organized locally.The aim of the study is to evaluate the migrant councils, which are thought to have an important role in the triangle of migration, multiculturalism and integration, within the framework of an intercultural approach. In the study, which has a qualitative research design, a descriptive analysis of migrant councils will be tried to be made, and the functioning of these mechanism will be evaluated together with current national and international regulations in Turkey and in the World. Thus, the importance and power of local dynamics in solving the phenomenon of migration, which is considered a global problem at first glance, will be revealed, especially in the context of the migrant councils, which are a local actor that is not yet sufficiently visible in Turkey.

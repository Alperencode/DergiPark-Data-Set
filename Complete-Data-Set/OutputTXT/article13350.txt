Makale Başlığı: Unnatural narrative forms in Javier Marías' The Infatuations
Özet: It has been observed that in recent literature literary works including novels, short tales, poetry, and essays are frequently analyzed through the viewpoint of mimetic criticism theories, with any potential anti-mimetic elements left out. Accordingly, a field known as unnatural narratology has evolved to explore the non-mimetic elements of literary works that transcend the human constraints of human beings in order to fill in the gaps of the current theories of mimetic criticism, especially in the postmodern age. Theoretically, it is anticipated that such a theoretical approach will help the reader understand fictional representations that go against traditional mimetic presumptions, such as those that involve a telepathic narrator, an animal, an inanimate object, a machine, a corpse, and/or a “you or we” narrative. This study tends to examine acclaimed Spanish author Javier Marías’ The Infatuations, which has a variety of anti-mimetic narrative elements, including a telepathic narrator who reads the minds of the novel's characters and the use of "we-narrative" language, through unnatural narratology. Accordingly, it has also been noted that the author favors a telepathic narrator because he possesses a narrative style that "reflects the smallest elements of life" and can reach into the characters' consciousness. A profound emotional depiction has been achieved by depicting the consciousness of the characters through imaginary visualization, considering that it is not possible to know exactly what the characters think and feel about issues such as murder, death, skepticism, etc. A collective point of view is presented by shifting from a singular discourse to a plural discourse. The narrator's narrative identity is communalized by the author's narration of the most typical states of humanity through the "we narrative" language.

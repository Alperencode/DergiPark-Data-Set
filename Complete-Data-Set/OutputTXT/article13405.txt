Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, DEPRESSION, NUTRITION AND PAIN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PERIOD
Özet: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that affects the respiratory tract. After the disease was recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), precautions such as social isolation and curfews were implemented to prevent the spread of the disease. These precautions have affected individuals' physical activity levels, anxiety levels, and eating habits. Reduced physical activity level, emotional changes, and bad eating habits are among the factors that may affect perceived pain.  The purpose of our study is to determine the changing basic lifestyles during the Covid-19 disease period and to examine their relationship with the perceived pain level. The study was a quick and large cross-sectional online survey using the Google Forms web survey platform. 1174 volunteers between the ages of 18-65 participated in our study. The survey contained demographic information, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to determine physical activity levels, Attitude Scale for Healthy Nutrition (ASHN) to evaluate nutritional attitudes, Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression levels, and The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) to determine perceived pain levels. A moderate correlation was found between insufficient physical activity and neck pain (r=-0.262, p=0.040), back pain (r=-0.254, p=0.048) and low back pain (r=-0.275, p=0.034). On the other hand, a weak correlation was found between depression levels and low back pain (r=0.213, p=0.049). A negative correlation was found between anxiety and depression levels and physical activity level (r=-0.433, p=0.033; r=-0.549, p=0.004) and healthy eating attitude (r=-0.258, p=0.041; r=-0.317, p=0.039). During the Covid-19 pandemic, it is necessary to increase the physical activity levels of the public and to make them aware of the short and long-term negative effects that may occur as a result of changes in basic lifestyles.

Reproduction, which means replication, imitation, or replica in art education, generally has a negative image. However, in reality, imitation is one of the best learning tools in all education areas. Imitation of art techniques applied in a classical work in any branch of art paves the way for future works and plays a vital role in education. Also, reproduction, prolonging the life of works that best reflect traditional values, undertake an essential task in terms of preserving artistic values in transferring these values to future generations.

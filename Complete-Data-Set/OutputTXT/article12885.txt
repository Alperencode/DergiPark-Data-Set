Makale Başlığı: The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on supply chain, artificial intelligence, and technology community: The Gini coefficient and an economic growth assessment
Özet: The focus of this study is the digitalization of the supply chain, artificial intelligence, and human capital. It aims to contribute to the literature by addressing the gaps in this field. It also seeks to explain the relationship between supply chain, artificial intelligence, and employment in the post-Covid-19 era and in the post-technology society. Findings of the study show that vulnerabilities in the supply chain mechanism during the pandemic have affected global economic paradigms. In addition, this study examines the artificial intelligence-oriented supply chain during and after the Covid-19 era. It is important in that it associates artificial intelligence-oriented supply chain with competition, employment, and sustainability. This study is unique in that it presents the components of Covid-19’s impact on the supply chain as a cluster.In the first part of the article, related literature is reviewed. In the second part, the relationship between supply chain, artificial intelligence, inflation, and real wages during the Covid-19 pandemic is explained. In the third part of the study, economic growth evaluations regarding the Covid-19 pandemic are made based on the Gini coefficient. As a result, it is worth noting that this study suggests lowering the Gini coefficient by linking the artificial intelligence- oriented supply chain to employment and development in the technology society.

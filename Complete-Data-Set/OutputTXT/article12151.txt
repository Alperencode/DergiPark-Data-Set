Makale Başlığı: Thermal ablation, nonthermal ablation and surgical striping applications: 1-year single center early results
Özet: Objective: Starting from the 1990’s minimally invasive methods such as endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) developed.Method: This study includes a total of 136 patients (81 women/55 men), of whom 22 (10 women/12 men) were treated with classic surgical stripping, 54 (32 women/22 men) with thermal ablation and 60 (39 women/21 men) with non-thermal ablation.Results: Twenty-two patients (10 women/12 men) were treated with surgical stripping. In one female patient a hematoma arose in the medial crural region postoperatively. A radiofrequency catheter (ThermoBLOCK TM) was used in the thermal ablation procedures in 54 patients (32 female/22 male). While permanent paresthesia occurred in one female patient after the procedure, temporary paresthesia occurred in 3 male patients postoperatively. Non-thermal ablation was performed in 60 patients (39 female/21 male). Even through a severe burning sensation was present in 6 patients (5 female/1 male) during the procedure, this symptom was only transient. In one of the patients, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred at the level of the popliteal vein postoperatively at the sixth day.Conclusion: Even if thermal and non-thermal ablation and surgical procedures have the same pain decreasing rates, hematomas and a longer hospital stay are more frequent in surgical procedures.

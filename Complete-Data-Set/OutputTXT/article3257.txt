Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Specific Heat and Calculation of the Entropy, Enthalpy, and Free Energy Close to the Lower Phase Transition in Imidazolium Perchlorate
Özet: The abnormal behavior of the specific heat of Imidazolium Perchlorate (Im-ClO4) was analyzed in terms of the power-law formula (including critical exponent α and fitting parameter JA) derived from the Ising model around the lower phase transition temperature of TC = 247 K. Moreover, the temperature dependence of some thermodynamic functions such as entropy, enthalpy, and the Gibbs free energy were calculated using the values of α and 𝐽𝐴 extracted from the observed specific heat data of Im-ClO4.

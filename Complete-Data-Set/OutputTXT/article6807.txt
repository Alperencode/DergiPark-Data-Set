Makale Başlığı: Effectiveness of Early-stage Neurodevelopmental Treatment Following Brain Tumor Surgery
Özet: Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the early-stage neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) concept after brain tumor surgery and compare the results with those of acute stroke patients. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study that analyzed baseline hospitalization data and scores for motor function, activities of daily living (ADL), and cognitive status, recorded immediately after hospitalization and before discharge from acute stroke patients and patients with brain tumors undergoing surgery. An Early-stage NDT program was applied to both patient groups.Results: 16 brain tumor patients matched with 16 acute stroke patients according to gender, and lesion sides. The length of stay in the rehabilitation of the patients with brain tumors was longer compared to the stroke patients. The within-group comparison revealed significant improvements in total The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement Measure (STREAM), and STREAM subscales in the brain tumor group, and the stroke group (p<0.05). The median gains score between admission and discharge rehabilitation on the total STREAM, STREAM subscales, and the Functional Independence Measure was similar in the brain tumor group and stroke group (p>0.05). The median gain score in the Mini-Mental State Examination score between admission, and discharge rehabilitation was greater in the brain tumor group (p<0.05).Conclusion: The early postoperative NDT approach to patients with brain tumors can improve ADL, motor, and cognitive functions, similar to results shown in stroke patients.

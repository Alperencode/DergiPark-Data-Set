Makale Başlığı: THE POLITICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF ISLAM IN THE CARIBBEAN
Özet: The sociopolitical role of Islam is relatively limited in the Caribbean, as Muslims make up less than 1 percent of the total population in the region. Only three Caribbean states (Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad&Tobago) have a considerable proportion of Muslim population. Hence, it is worth studying to what extent Muslims participate in political life and in what ways they produce an effect in these states. Notwithstanding their minority status, Caribbean Muslims, who originate mainly from western Africa and southern Asia as a result of colonialism, appear to be such a powerful political actor that they attempted to overthrow the government in one instance and have prompted close ties between the Islamic world and their respective countries. Hence, this paper aims to analyse the mentioned political activism in a comparative way.

Makale Başlığı: The linguistic use of ellipsis yesterday and today: The example of the news magazine ‚Der Spiegel‘
Özet: Every person has verbal and non-verbal components that serve him/her to communicate with his/her environment. However, since language is a dynamic phenomenon, a natural and living being, one of its essential characteristics is that it is constantly changing. Due to the influence of social and individual factors, a significant change has been observed in society and, thus, also in the language since the 20th century. Linguistic studies have shown that the expression is shorter and more straightforward. In linguistics, this syntactic phenomenon is called an “ellipse” and occurs in both spoken and written languages, and has meanings such as linguistic economy and thrift. Since changes in individual text elements only become noticeable when a particular type of text is considered over a longer historical period, this article makes a contrasting linguistic comparison of the news magazine Der Spiegel of the past and the present. It thus analyses the use of the stylistic medium Ellipsis diachronically. For this purpose, two issues of the news magazine Der Spiegel of the earlier period (No. 1, 1947) and the present period (No. 26, 2021) are analyzed from a quantitative point of view concerning their stylistic structure.

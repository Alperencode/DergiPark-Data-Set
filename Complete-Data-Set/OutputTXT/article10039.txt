Makale Başlığı: An Evaluation of The Effects of Online Education During The COVID-19 Pandemic on The Refraction Values of Children With Myopia
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in refraction values in children receiving online education because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: Fifty-six patients under the age of 18 who received distance education during the pandemic period, had at least 6 hours of screen exposure and were prescribed spectacles were included in the study. Visual acuity was measured with Snellen Chart. The refraction values seen by the patient were recorded and his records were scanned retrospectively. Refraction values in 2020 were compared with refraction values in 2018 and 2019. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: The mean age of the patients was 14.23±3.17 years. The mean refraction values of the patients in 2020 were -2.69±1.37 D in the right eye and -2.63±1.01 D in the left eye. The mean refraction values in 2019 were -2.17±1.10 D in the right eye and -2.00±1.23 D in the left eye. Mean refraction values of the patients in 2018 were -1.54±1.22 D in the right eye and -1.42±1.18 D in the left eye. The average refraction values of the patients in both eyes in 2020 were significantly higher compared to 2019, and the average refraction values in 2019 were significantly higher than in 2018 (p<0.001, p<0.001). Refraction increase during the pandemic period was similar to the previous year (right: p=0.48, left: p=0.94).Conclusion: In our study, we found a significant increase in the mean refraction values of myopic children who receiving online education due to the pandemic and had intense screen exposure, and this increase was similar to the previous year. We think that this situation is caused by the unconscious long-term use of electronic devices such as smartphones, computers and tablets in addition to the online education during the pandemic period, the decrease in time spent outside and the long-term close work.

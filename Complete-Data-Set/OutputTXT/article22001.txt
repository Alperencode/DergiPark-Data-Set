Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Bed Thickness and Rock Strength in Greywackes
Özet: The prediction of the real safe stress value isvery important for the technical attempts concerning stratified rocks (especiallyrock mass containing multiple crack systems and many rock units). In thisstudy, it is aimed that the determining the real stress values of the rockmedia with discontinuities on outcrops by geotechnical engineers (civil-specialized in geotechnic- and geological -specialized in engineering geology-engineers).

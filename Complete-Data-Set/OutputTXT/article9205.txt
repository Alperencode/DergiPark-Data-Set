Makale Başlığı: Investigation of acute effect of kinesio taping applied to gastrocnemius muscle  on jumping height in track and field jumping athletes
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of facilitation and inhibition kinesio tape application techniques applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of track and field jumping athletes on jumping height.Methods: Seventeen track and field jumping athletes were included in the study. The athletes were randomly allocated to the facilitation or inhibition group and the kinesio tape was applied to both gastrocnemius muscles of the athletes. The squat, free jump, and active jump heights of the athletes were assessed with the Microgate Optojump® measuring device before taping and 24 hours after taping while the tape was on.Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in age, body weight, height, and body mass index values (p> 0.05). It was determined that the squat, free and active jump heights before and after banding of the facilitation and inhibition groups and the power values produced during these jumps were similar and there was no difference between the groups (p> 0.05).Conclusion: As a result of our study, it was determined that the application of facilitation and inhibition kinesio tape applied to the gastrocnemius muscle on athletics jumpers did not affect the vertical jump performance.

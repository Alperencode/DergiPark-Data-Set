Makale Başlığı: International Medical Students' Financial Security in China: Lessons from an Individual Case Study
Özet: Financial security affects international students’ success and wellbeing and is a cause for great concern. However, it is still understudied in the literature. This is an especially important issue in countries where most international students are self-financed and/or originate from developing countries. This is the case in China, which hosts a large number of international students, and where such research is still lacking. Adopting a phenomenological approach, this exploratory study was a case study of a high-achieving international medical student in China who experienced (and overcame) financial difficulties. Findings of the study have important implications for policy and practice, and call for an expansion of the Chinese government’s policy concerning the financial needs of poor domestic students, supporting them with financial resources and extending these resources to students from developing countries studying in the Chinese higher education system. The implications also include the need for Chinese universities to assume greater responsibility and provide more support for the learning and wellbeing of international students.

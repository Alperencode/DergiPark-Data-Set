Makale Başlığı: Some Results on the $p$-Weak Approximation Property in Banach Spaces
Özet: In this study, some existing results dealing with the weak approximation property of Banach spaces are considered for the $p$-weak approximation property. Also, an observation on the bounded weak approximation and the $p$-bounded weak approximation properties is given. Moreover, the proof of the solution of the duality problem for the $p$-weak approximation property which exists in the literature is given in a shorter way as an alternative.

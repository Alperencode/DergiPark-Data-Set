Makale Başlığı: Examination of Behavioral Finance Concept in the World and Turkey by Using Bibliometric Analysis
Özet: Traditional finance concept is based on the premise that individuals are rational individuals who are free from their emotions and make decisions by considering the maximum benefit. Behavioral finance, on the other hand, is a field that focuses on the assumption that individuals are not always rational in their financial decisions, that they are irrational or limitedly rational, and that they are often emotional.When the literature on the subject in Turkey is examined, it has been determined that there is no bibliographic study on behavioral finance. In this study, the situation of the concept of behavioral finance in the world and in Turkey has been examined in order to close this gap. In the process of carrying out this analysis, the Web of Science (WoS) database was used to observe the situation of behavioral finance in the world, the TR index database and the National Thesis Center were used to determine the situation in Turkey. In this context, studies conducted in Turkey and in the world were examined. The change of many factors such as author, journal, field, keyword, which are decisive for the research, and the relationships between all these have been revealed.

Makale Başlığı: TWO REPRESENTATIVES IN OTTOMAN MATERIALIST PHILOSOPHY PUBLICATION:  DAĞARCIK AND FELSEFE MECMUASI
Özet: Ottoman intellectuals started to interest in the Western Philosophy with the translations especially from French Philosophy starting with the second half of the 19th century. Publications on Western Philosophy, which began in 1850s are not only limited with books, they also includes newspapers and journals. In this article, I will mention two journals, Dağarcık (1871-1872) of Ahmed Midhat and Felsefe Mecmuası (1913) of Baha Tevfik which were contributed to the Ottoman intellectual life and won a seat in their era. It is not wrong to say both journals are materialist journals. In this article, some of the important philosophical and scientific articles of these two journals and their attitudes and influencers about philosophy, science, materialism and evolution, that there are 40 years between the publication dates of these journals, will be analysed. In addition, the ways of interpreting these thoughts that they were influenced by and presenting them to the society with their own ideas according to notions, like religion which the society was sensitive will be discussed. The aim of this article is, presenting the phraseology of these four notions among the Ottoman materialist publications in 40 years and changing intellectual circle and world of ideas.

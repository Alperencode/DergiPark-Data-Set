Makale Başlığı: Characterization of Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) Stalk Pulp and Evaluation in Paper Production
Özet: In this study, the evaluability of chickpea stalks generated after harvest in chickpea production was investigated in pulp and paper production. Besides, paper production was carried out by blending the chickpea stalk fibers with primary and secondary fibers in certain proportions and the effects of chickpea stalk fibers on the paper properties were determined. Modified kraft method was used in the pulping of chickpea stalks and anthraquinone (AQ) was added to the cooking solution as a catalyst. Some chemical, mechanical and optical properties of the pulps produced with the addition of different AQ charges were compared and the optimum results were obtained from the 0.7% AQ added cooking experiment. The yield and viscosity values of the chickpea stalk pulps increased by 12.6% and 34.2%, respectively and the kappa number decreased by 46.7% with the addition of AQ to cooking liquor. Paper production was carried out by blending the fibers obtained from optimum cooking condition with primary and secondary fibers in certain rates and the effects of chickpea stalk fibers on the paper properties were examined. Depending on the amount of chickpea stalk fibers, the mechanical properties of the papers produced with secondary fibers and the optical properties of the papers produced with primary fibers improved. The strength losses that occur during the recycling of waste paper could be reduced by blending the chickpea stalk fibers with secondary fibers and it is possible to produce various paper types such as writing-printing paper by blending the short fiber chickpea stalk fibers and long fibers.

Makale Başlığı: A Comparison of Shear Bond Strength of Two Resin Cements to Different Metal Alloys
Özet: The aim of this study was to investigate the shear bond strength (SBS) of resin cement to different metals manufactured by computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and laser sintering. One hundred and sixty specimens were prepared and divided into four groups of metal alloy discs: Cr-Co (hard metal, HM; soft metal, SM; laser sintering, LS), and titanium metal (TM). Specimens were sandblasted with 50 μm aluminum oxide and divided into two subgroups, each of which received one of the following luting cements: Adhesive resin cement, Self-etch/self-adhesive resin cement. 50% of the specimens were thermal cycled (10000 cycles, 5–55°C) before being tested for shear bond strength. At thermocycle 0, the highest SBS value (18.3 ± 3 MPa) was found with the self-etch/self-adhesive cement of the HM group (P < 0.05). At thermocycle 10000, there was a significant difference between the cements in the SM and LS groups (p<0.05). Whereas there was no significant difference between the GL groups in terms of thermal cycling, there was a significant difference in the ME groups. The adhesive resin cement was found to be more resistant to thermal cycling than self-etch/self-adhesive cement.

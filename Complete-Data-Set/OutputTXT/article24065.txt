Makale Başlığı: COMPARISON OF TALIBAN AND DAESH ON SIMILAR AND DIFFERENCES: THE EFFECTS OF DAESH KHORASAN GROUP ON THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN
Özet: Defining Afghanistan as "imperial cemetery" is a correct determination. Many countries dominated Afghanistan. Looking at the recent past of the country, it was occupied by the Soviet Union and the USA. In addition to the loss of a large number of soldiers during the invasion of Afghanistan by these two superpowers, they also suffered significant financial losses during the struggle in difficult geographical conditions. In addition, these states have also experienced image losses in the eyes of the world public opinion. Due to the internal turmoil, the Soviet occupation, the first Taliban and the US occupation, the ancient lands of Afghanistan are now referred to as terrorism. Numerous terrorist organizations operate in this country. In this study, an evaluation was made about the struggle that emerged between the Taliban and DAESH (ISIS). This struggle, which took place over DAESH-K (ISIS-K), reached a different level with the withdrawal of the USA from Afghanistan. DAESH-K, which did not accept the Taliban's takeover of power in Afghanistan, started to fight them. During the struggle between the Taliban and DAESH-K, the future of Afghanistan as well as the attitude of the Afghan people towards this struggle were also evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: Preservice Mathematics Teachers’ Ability to Perform the Mathematizing Process: The Cylinder Packing Problem
Özet: The present study aims to examine the preservice middle school mathematics teachers’ ability to perform the process of mathematizing and to identify their competencies within this context. For this purpose, the study was conducted with 43 preservice teachers attending a state university. The research method used is descriptive research. As the data collection tool, a real-life problem called "cylinder packing problem" was presented to preservice teachers, with a view to finding the optimal and lowest-cost packing scheme for a hazelnut grower. The solutions presented by the preservice teachers were subjected to content analysis as well as descriptive analysis. The preservice teachers’ competencies were examined to see their level of effectiveness in the use of notations that are indicators of mathematizing, in achieving mathematical results in the process of problem-solving. The research findings indicate that the preservice teachers generally lacked sufficient comprehension of the problem in the real-life contexts and could not perform the requirements of important skills such as using notations, mathematical models and generalization method which are important in making abstract inferences in the mathematizing process. In light of these findings, further studies to contribute to preservice teachers’ mathematical sophistication levels are recommended in order to improve their competencies in mathematizing.

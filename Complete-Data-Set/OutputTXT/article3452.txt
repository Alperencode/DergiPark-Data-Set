Makale Başlığı: Protective effect of resveratrol on cisplatin induced damage in rat kidney
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of resveratrol on cisplatin induced damage in rat kidney.Materials and Methods: 30 female Wistar-Albino rats were allocated to form three groups: In group 1 (control group), 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl (saline) was administered intraperitoneally for 3 days. In group 2 (cisplatin group), 7.5 mg / kg intraperitoneal cisplatin was given for 3 days. In group 3 (cisplatin + resveratrol group) 7.5 mg / kg cisplatin and 10 mg / kg resveratrol were given via intraperitoneal route. Right kidneys were surgically extirpated in all groups. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in both blood and tissues. Also, toxicity markers such as vascular congestion, hemorrhage, tubule degeneration and glomerular damage were assessed by examining the slides prepared from kidney tissue with microscopy.Results: Tissue damage was significantly higher in group 2 than other groups. The MDA levels were significantly higher and the activities of SOD, and CAT were lower in group 2 than other groups. Conclusion: According to our short term findings, resveratrol might be an effective molecule to prevent the harmful effect of cisplatin in rat kidney.

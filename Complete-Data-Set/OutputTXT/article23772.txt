Makale Başlığı: Perceptions of middle school students participated in a science festival towards scientists and the evaluation of the science festival according to different groups of participants
Özet: One of the prerequisites for understanding science and the nature of scientific knowledge is to understand the individuals working in this field correctly. Interactions with scientists who exhibit qualities and behaviours different from the stereotypes about scientists help to change these stereotypical images and beliefs. In this context, this study aims to examine the effect of students' participation in a science festival on their perceptions of scientists and to determine the evaluation of the science festival according to different groups of participants. The quantitative part of the study was carried out with a one-group pretest-posttest design. The DAST (Draw a Scientist Test) developed by Chambers (1983) was used to determine the students’ perceptions of scientists before and after their participation in the activities. Forms consisting of short-answer questions about the activities and science presentations were used to evaluate the science festival according to participants’ (n=80) views. The Draw A Scientist Checklist (DAST-C) developed by Finson, Beaver, and Cramond (1995) was used to analyze the participant drawings. In the analysis of the forms filled out by the students, inductive content analysis was used. The perceptions of the students about scientists changed significantly after participation in the activities. Also, participants stated that the project had positive contributions in cognitive, affective and psychomotor areas and personal development.

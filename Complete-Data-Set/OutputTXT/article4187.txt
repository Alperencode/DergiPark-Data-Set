Makale Başlığı: Thomas Brussig ‘Helden wie wir’: The humorous staging of memory as a postmodern narrative strategy
Özet: The Focus of this study is to answer to the question of what effect and aim of the humorous narrative strategy in german post- reunification literature of the 1990 s causes. For this purpose, the processing of historical events such as “the fall of the Berlin Wall” in various contemporary texts and literary genre analysis is also explained with psychological-theoretical approaches to then interpret the work Helden wie wir by Thomas Brussig in this context. Based on the categorization of the work, among belonging to other literary genres as also as a picaresque novel, it proves that a form of reflection on the past by exoneration theory and incongruity theory can be used as a sophisticated attempt to understand the failure of socialism ideology and a complex process of unification from a literary perspective.

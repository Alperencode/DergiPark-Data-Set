Makale Başlığı: Effects of different fertilizer applications on yield, yield components and fiber quality in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
Özet: In this study, Candia variety was used according to the randomized block plots experimental design in Şanlıurfa-Harran conditions in 2020-2021 and was carried out with 3 replications. Each parcel consisted of 5 rows, the parcel length was 12 m, the row spacing was 70 cm, and the row spacing was 10-12 cm. The experiment consisted of a total of 24 plots. In the study, applications consisting of mixtures of different chemical and organic fertilizers were applied. These are 1-Control, 2-Base fertilizer (0 kg)+Top fertilizer (Urea 35 kg da-1), 3-Base fertilizer (10 kg DAP da-1)+Top fertilizer (Urea 35 kg da-1), 4-Base fertilizer (20 kg DAP da-1)+Top fertilizer (Urea 35 kg da-1), 5-Base fertilizer (30 kg DAP da-1) )+Top fertilizer (Urea 35 kg da-1), 6-Base manure (2 tons farm fertilizer da-1)+ Top fertilizer (Urea 35 kg da-1), 7-Base manure (4 tons farm fertilizer da-1)+Top manure (Urea 35 kg da-1), 8-Base manure (6 tons farm fertilizer da-1)+Top fertilizer (Urea 35 kg da-1) consisted of subjects. In post-harvest measurements, yield per decare (kg da-1), number of bolls (piece plant-1), boll weight (g), boll seed weight (g), ginning outturn (%), 100 seed weight, fiber fineness (mic.), fiber strength (g tex-1) and fiber length (mm) were investigated. According to the results obtained from the study; the highest number of cocoons in both years of the experiment (24.33 and 24.66 per plant); boll weight (6.66 and 6.55 g); The yield per decare (526.40 and 514.66 kg da-1) was obtained from the application of 6 tons of farm manure + 35 kg of urea. It has been determined that the applications that are the subject of the study have no effect on the fiber quality properties.

Makale Başlığı: ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN
Özet: The study aims to discover the probable roles of cultural characteristics in the relationship betweenorganizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and workplace ostracism which is a critical phenomenon amongemployees. It was designed in a causal model claiming that there are moderating effects of collectivism andbelief in collective emotions in the relationship between OCB and workplace ostracism. 309 employeeswere included randomly in Turkey, and correlation and regression analyses were conducted to test thehypothesis. Unlike similar studies and the expected relationship in our hypotheses, OCB and workplaceostracism were found negatively correlated. Moreover, neither organizational collectivism nor employees’belief in collective emotions had a moderating role in this relationship. The study showed that the darkside of the OCB does not work for the Turkish culture, although its collectivist features. It is evident thatglobalization makes the collectivist organizations’ strict norms and rules more flexible and loosens theemployees’ collectivist beliefs. Regardless of the cultural characteristics, the study also underlines thatworkplace ostracism should be prevented with appropriate management strategies like encouragingemployees to be engaged in citizenship behaviors.

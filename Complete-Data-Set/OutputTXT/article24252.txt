Makale Başlığı: Bilateral bony increased-offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis shoulder with severe glenoid bone defect: a case report
Özet: A 53-year-old woman presented with 10-year history of pain and limited range of motion in both shoulders. Radiographs of both shoulders showed severe destructive change with glenoid bone defect. Very thin rotator cuff and superior migration of the humerus were also observed on computed tomography arthrography images. We performed bony increased-offset reverse total shoulder arthroplasty on her both shoulders to resolve these major problems although it was a much challengeable operation, which resulted in a good clinical outcome without any particular complication. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0384This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

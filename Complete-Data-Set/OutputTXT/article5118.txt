Makale Başlığı: Determination of Agro-Morphological Characteristics of New Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)  Varieties in Kayseri Conditions
Özet: This study was carried out to evaluate the agro-morphological characteristics of new chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cultivars in Kayseri conditions. The research was established and carried out in 2022 in the experimental area located in the central campus of the Erciyes University Agricultural Research and Application Center, according to the randomized blocks trial design with 3 replications. In our experiment; registered in our country between 2015-2021 years that Aslanbey (2016), Atabay (2019), Aydoğan (2018), Bahadır (2019), Çiftçi (2021), Göktürk (2019), Karlı (2018), Nihatbey (2020) and Tunç (2019) varieties were used.According to the results obtained in the research; plant height 37,33-50,00 (cm), first pod height 23,0-34,3 (cm), number of main branches per plant 2,3-3,3 (pieces), number of pods per plant 18,3-31,3 (pieces), number of seeds per pod 0,860-0,980 (pieces), The number of grains per plant was 16,00-30,67 (pieces), the grain yield per unit area was 207,3-436,67 (kg/da), and the hundred grain weight was 33,00-43,67(g). Accordingly, Atabay and Aslanbey varieties, which have the highest grain yield in terms of grain yield, are known to be recommended for Kayseri ecological conditions.

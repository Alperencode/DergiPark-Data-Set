Makale Başlığı: University Students’ Positive and Negative Perceptions of Lifelong Learning: A Metaphoric Analysis
Özet: In tertiary education, lifelong learning (LL) skills alongside technical skills need to be prioritized. Is it, however, correct to assume that all university students are familiar with LL?  Even so, might some students believe that LL is a source of tension? One way to understand these aspects is through metaphors, commonly used to convey the meaning individuals attach to concepts. Thus, this study investigated 229 university students’ metaphoric perceptions of LL. Data were collected using a discourse completion task. Results revealed that the students had limited understanding of LL as reflected through their chosen metaphors. The metaphors most frequently used to define LL were “tree,” “life,” “universe” and “trip.”  The students’ explanations pointed to a variety of attributes of LL, “continuity,” “limitlessness,” and “expansion of horizons” being the most frequent ones. There were also metaphors and attributes denoting negative perceptions. We recommend LL skills be made an integral part of curricula to enhance students’ potential for becoming lifelong learners.

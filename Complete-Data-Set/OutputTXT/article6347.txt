Makale Başlığı: BULGARIAN CITIES AND THE ORIGINAL PROBLEMS OF BULGARIAN CITIES
Özet: In the article, the formation of the first fixed settlements in connection with the settlement process of the Volga Bulgars, the criteria for evaluating the settlements as cities, the emergence and origins of the cities, the characteristics of the cities and the problems related to their classification were examined. In this context, it has been determined that the origin of the Bulgarian cities is related to the settlement problem of the Bulgars and the time when the first fixed settlements appeared. In general, researchers have tended to a wide variety of options regarding the origin and emergence processes of cities with very different forms of social structure. In this regard, the author examined the opinions of the researchers who made assumptions about the emergence and origin of the Bulgarian cities and stated his own assumptions in order to clarify the origin problematic. According to the author, the proto-cities, which came into being at the late stage of the tribal system, that is, when the large tribes and inter-tribal associations were formed and were the centers of ethno-social formations, developed over time as administrative, religious or cult, military-political centers and trade points. The mentioned development points of the fortified settlements brought along the origin classification of the cities, that is, the determination of the ways of their emergence. The variety of ways in which medieval cities emerged has been practiced on Volga Bulgar cities, these ways are attested by pre-Mongol Volga Bulgar materials (10th-13th centuries). However, researchers focused on three main ways of the origins of the Volga Bulgar cities: tribal center, trade-craft center and administrative-military fortress.

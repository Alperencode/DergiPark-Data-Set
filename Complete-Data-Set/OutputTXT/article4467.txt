Makale Başlığı: Endovascular Treatment of Acute Renal Artery Hemorrhages: Efficacy and Effect on Renal Functions
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and complications of endovascular treatment of acute renal artery hemorrhage and the etiology of the condition.Material and Methods: Twenty-two patients who underwent endovascular embolization with renal acute artery hemorrhage between 2016 and 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Etiologies of the acute renal artery hemorrhage were investigated. Laboratory and clinical follow-up information were analyzed for the efficacy and the complication of the treatment. The serum creatinine levels of the patients before and after the procedure were compared.Results: Selective renal artery embolization procedures were performed in a total of 22 patients. Of the 22 patients, 10 (45.5%) were male and 12 (54.5%) were female. The patients' ages ranged from 5 to 79 years, and the mean age of the patients was 51.5±18.6 years. Clinical success was achieved in 91.7% of embolization procedures. A statistically significant increase was seen in the serum creatinine levels of the patients after the procedure compared to 24 hours before the angiography procedure (median: 0.97 vs. 0.93, p=0.046). No significant change was observed in serum blood urea nitrogen and the estimated glomerular filtration rate levels (p=0.338, and p=0.067, respectively). Acute renal failure and postembolization syndrome were observed in only one patient as complications. The complication rate was found to be 4.5%.Conclusion: Selective embolization of the renal artery has high clinical success in acute renal artery hemorrhages without impairing renal function. The treatment has advantages such as no need for general anesthesia, and low complication rates.

Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Toltrazuril Administration on Serum Oxidative Stress Levels, Serum Haptoglobin Levels and Hematological Parameters in The Treatment of Acute Natural Coccidiosis in Honamli Kids
Özet: Coccidiosis caused by Eimeria species is one of the factors causing diarrhea in lambs and kids. Although it is known that toltrazuril is quite effective in the treatment of acute coccidiosis in lambs and kids, there is limited information on how it affects the animals. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of toltrazuril application in the treatment of acute natural coccidiosis in Honamlı kids, serum oxidative stress levels, serum haptoglobin levels and hematological parameters. The material of this study was 10 Honamlı male kids, 20-30 days old, with acute natural coccidiosis, in a private farm. Toltrazuril was administered at a single dose of 20 mg/kg in the treatment of coccidiosis. In the findings, A statistical difference (p<0.05) was determined between pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements of white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte count, lymphocyte %, neutrophil count, neutrophil %, eosinophil count, eosinophil %, basophil count, basophil %, monocyte count, monocyte %, red blood cell (RBC) count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) counti mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) count values. In addition, a statistical difference (p<0.05) was determined between pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements of total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) values. In conclusion, in this study, it was determined that toltrazuril was effective in the treatment of kids with acute coccidiosis, and 7 days after the application of toltrazuril, the haptoglobin (Hp)  value increased and total antioxidant status (TAS), TOS and OSI values decreased.

Makale Başlığı: OIL, NATURAL GAS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: THE CASE OF THE EU
Özet: The world economy is faced with various extraordinary situations. The financial crises experienced and the covid-19 process create shocking effects on the world economy. With the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, the energy problem is the new agenda of the world economy. Energy is of great importance for the industry of developed EU countries. Ensuring the uninterrupted and secure transfer of energy is seen as an important element for the survival and growth of the EU. Oil and natural gas, which is frequently preferred by both individual use and various sectors, has a different position compared to other types of energy. In this study, the possible effect of oil and natural gas consumptions on economic growth in EU countries for the period 2000-2020 was investigated by panel data analysis. For this purpose, two different econometric models were established. In the first model, 26 EU countries, and in the second model, 25 EU countries are considered. As control variables in both models; fixed capital investments and export series are used. The aim of the first model is to determine the effect of oil consumption on economic growth. In the findings of the first model, it has been observed that an increase in oil consumption has a positive effect on economic growth. The purpose of the second model is to determine the possible effect of natural gas consumption on economic growth. The findings of the second model show that natural gas consumption does not have a statistically significant effect on economic growth.

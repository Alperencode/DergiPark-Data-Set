Makale Başlığı: THE PERSPECTIVES OF POLITICAL PARTIES ON ANTI-CORRUPTION IN TURKEY: AN EVALUATION BASED ON PARTY PROGRAMS
Özet: This study deals with the perspective of Turkey's political parties on the fight against corruption through the party programs of the parties that have a group in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey after the June 24, 2018 general election. To do so first of all, the theoretical framework on the definition, types and effects of corruption, the causes of corruption and the fight against corruption has been established. Content analysis and document analysis method, which are among the qualitative research methods, were used together in the analysis of the data on the fight against corruption in the party program of each party. The data obtained from the party programs were compared and evaluated in the conclusion part. The following conclusions were reached in the research: HDP (Peoples’ Democratic Party), one of the parties with a group in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, does not have any policy regarding the fight against corruption in its party program. AK Parti (Justice and Development Party), CHP (Republican People’s Party) and İYİ Parti (Good Party) emphasize institutional policies aimed at preventing and punishing corruption through administrative and legal regulations in the fight against corruption. It is seen that MHP has determined similar institutional policies and more comprehensive policies aimed at raising social awareness on the fight against corruption.

Makale Başlığı: The Healing Promise of Adoptions: Revisiting a Foundational American Myth through News of the World
Özet: The 2020 release of News of the World, adapted by PaulGreengrass, returns to the American cultural trope of white-Indianadoption to the big screen. These adoption narratives, in film andliterature, offer the promise of healing, though the adoption more oftenbenefits the white community and adoptive parents over the Indiancommunity and child. While these texts may acknowledge the declineof a particular Indian tribe, they generally celebrate how the individualsand the community may be stronger by remembering what has beenlost, through the new family connections. This essay examines thisrecent film in the context of this Hollywood and literary tradition –looking particularly at the novels The Bean Trees (1988) and Pigs inHeaven (1993) by Barbara Kingsolver and Indian Killer (1996) andFlight (2007) by Sherman Alexie.

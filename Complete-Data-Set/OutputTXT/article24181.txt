Makale Başlığı: Early Surgical Results of Patients With Pertrochanteric Fractures Treated With Proximal Femoral Locked Plates
Özet: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to analyze the early radiologic and clinical results of 48 patients with pertrochanteric fractures treated with proximal femoral locked plates and the advantage of this treatment method in non stable fracture patternsMETHODS: 28 female and 20 male patients were analyzed. Subtrochanteric fractures in 8 and intertrochanteric fractures in 40 patients were recorded. The mean period for operation after admission to hospital is 2.2 days. Proximal femoral locked plate was used for reconstruction in all patients.RESULTS: Patients were followed up for a mean period of 11.8 months. 1 deep and 2 superficial infections were recorded. Bony union was examined in 43 of 48 patients (89%).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In this study, we analyzed that, proximal femoral locked plate is a good surgical option for pertrochanteric fractures as it provides low morbidity rates and shorter union time.

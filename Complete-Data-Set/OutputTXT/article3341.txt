Makale Başlığı: Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Improves Liver Regeneration after Partial Liver Resection in Rats
Özet: Objective: Liver regeneration is necessary to restore hepatic mass and functional capacity after partial hepatectomy (PH). Cynara scolymus (CS) is a pharmacologically important plant that contains phenolic acids and flavonoids, and experimental studies have indicated that it has antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CS in liver regeneration after PH in rats. Methods: A total of 36 Wistar albino rats weighing 280.5 ± 18.6 g were used. CS leaf extract was administered after partial hepatectomy. The rats were sacrificed at postoperative day 14, and the histological changes were assessed. The mitotic index (MI), nucleus size, hepatocyte size, and binucleation rate (BR) of hepatocytes were assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Results: The rats that received CS extract had significant differences in liver regeneration markers, including the hepatocyte size, mitotic index, and Ki-67 proliferation index (p<0.05). The average increase in liver mass in 14 days was higher in the CS group, but the differences between the groups were not significant (1.70±0.2 g in sham group versus 2±0.8 g in CS group, p=0.75). Conclusions: The results indicate that CS leaf extract promoted hepatocellular proliferation and hypertrophy, which resulted in accelerated liver regeneration.

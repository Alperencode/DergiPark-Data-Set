Özet: The implementation of the strategic management approach in city management has become an important issue in terms of determining the future goals and objectives for that city, as well as determining the expectations of the people living in the relevant city and ensuring their participation in administrative issues. On the other hand, it has become necessary for local governments to restructure the activities and steps to be taken in the city in the face of regional and global developments. For this reason, strategic management, which all institutions and organizations do not hesitate to implement, and the strategic plans realized in this context have started to be realized for cities as well. Based on this, in the research carried out to do the strategic planning of the city, the opinions of the people living in the city were consulted and an answer was sought to the question "What kind of Gallipoli do you dream of". 1073 people answered their thoughts and opinions in writing, and after the obtained data were transcribed, they were deciphered with the MAXQDA program and categorical titles were created. In this context, eight main categorical titles were formed and classified according to frequency ranges.

Makale Başlığı: Syriacs Community in Turkey as a Subject of International Law
Özet: A significant part of the Syriacs, one of the oldest societies in the Middle East, immigratedto other countries and lost most of their population in the region for variousreasons. Although their homelands are Northern Iraq, Southeast Turkey and NortheastSyria, Syriac diasporas have emerged in many countries of the world, especially in Europe,due to migrations. Only the Armenian, Greek and Jewish communities were taken intoaccount as “non-Muslim minorities” in the Treaty of Laussanne, and others could not benefitfrom the rights as a minority. In this sense, the minority status of other non-Muslimor non-Turks living in Turkey has not been accepted. In this article, the emergence of theSyriac society, the experienced divisions, it’s current characteristics and the situation ofthe Syriacs in Turkey are summarized. In the light of the scope of minority status in InternationalLaw, the situation of the Turkish Syriac community in this context is analyzed.

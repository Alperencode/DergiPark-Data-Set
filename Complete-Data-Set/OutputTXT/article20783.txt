Makale Başlığı: Psychosocial triggers associated with major depressive episodes in women applying to psychiatric outpatient clinic
Özet: Aim: Factors such as personality traits, self-esteem, interpersonal relations and cognitive skills are considered among the risk factors of psychiatric disorders particularly for mood disorders. Presence of a single risk factor is not enough for the disease to emerge. The present study aimed to evaluate the presence of psychosocial triggering factors prior to the episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD) in female patients.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a total of 62 female patients, who visited the psychiatry policlinic and have been diagnosed with MDD alone according to SCID-I. After the diagnostic evaluation of the patients, detailed clinical interview was conducted to assess the presence of triggering factors for depressive episode. All of the participants described triggering factors for major depressive disorder.Results: Regarding the psychosocial factors as the potential triggers, 26 patients mentioned about the problem of communication and compliance with the spouse (42%), 10 mentioned about the presence of illness in the first-degree relatives (16%) and 10 mentioned about the conflict with the mother-in-law or other relatives (16%). When we collect “communication/compliance problem with the spouse” + “conflict with the mother-in-law/other family members” + “breaking up with the beloved one” + “husband’s cheating on her” stressor groups as a “relationship conflict” group, the mean of BDI and BAI scores of “relationship conflict” group were highest among the all groups.Conclusions: In the light of these outcomes, it can be concluded that particularly psychosocial factors associated with interpersonal relations play significant role as the triggering factors for depressive episodes in female patients. Among these factors, the problem of communication and compliance with the spouse is particularly striking.

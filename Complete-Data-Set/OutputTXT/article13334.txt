Makale Başlığı: Revisiting EFL students’ language learning autonomy and lifelong learning tendencies
Özet: The need to learn English is increasing more and more to keep up with the changes caused by globalization. However, what you learn is as important as how you learn it because the way you learn it influences the efficiency, permanence and sustainability of learning. One of these ways in undoubtedly is autonomous language learning. Taking the responsibility of one’s own learning could make the process more concrete and conscious, thus paving the way for lifetime learning. Having such traits gains greater importance at tertiary level where students are expected to be autonomous and lifelong learners. Hence, the present study dwelled upon the probable relationship between language learning autonomy and lifelong learning tendencies of EFL university students. The participants were both English-majoring and non-English majoring students. The data were collected and analyzed quantitatively. The study revealed a positive and significant relationship between language learner autonomy and lifelong learning. EFL students were found to have high beliefs of these constructs. The relation with age, gender and major was also investigated. Pedagogical implications were discussed at the end of the study.

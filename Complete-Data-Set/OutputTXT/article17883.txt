Makale Başlığı: A Study on The Determınatıon of Yield And Yield Components in Some Two-Rowed Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Varietiesi in Kırsehir Ecological Conditions
Özet: This study was carried out in order to determine grain yield and some yield components of 16 two-rowed barley varieties (Clarica, Efes 98, Erciyes, Ünver, Kalaycı, İnce 04, Aydanhanım, Bolayır, Sladoran, Larende, Beyşehir, Özdemir 05, Konevi, Harman, Bülbül, Tarm 92) in Kırşehir ecological conditions during 2014-2015 growing season. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 3 replications. There were significant differences in tested characters among barley cultivars. Days to headings were ranged between 208.3 and 197.3 days, grain filling duration 33.67 and 28.33 days, fertile spike number m-2 685.3 and 393.3, plant height 90.67 and 67.23 cm, spike lenght 8.43 and 4.93 cm, grain number per spike 29.00 and 18.00, grain weight per spike 1.50 and 0.72 g, thousand grain weight 43.50 and 33.63 g, grain yield 454.0 and 286.7 kg da-1. It was concluded that the highest grain yield was determined with 454.0 kg da-1 in Tarm 92 two-rowed barley variety. Tarm 92, Aydanhanım and Harman two-rowed barley cultivars could be recommended for Kırşehir ecological conditions.

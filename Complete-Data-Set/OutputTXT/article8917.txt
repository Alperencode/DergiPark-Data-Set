Makale Başlığı: The Transformative Effects of Theological Education: The Case of International Theology Students
Özet: In a world of constant change, attitudes and behaviors cannot be expected to remain the same. The social environment we live in, the education we receive, our personality structure, our socio-economic and health status and many other things cause our attitude and behavior change more or less. For this, attitude and behavior changes take place among the study subjects of many fields from economy to psychology, from health sciences to sociology. In this study, attitude and behavior change in the field of social-psychology has been handled specifically for International Theology Students. The study, which aims to determine what kind of attitude and behavior change the International Theology Students, who are in the last year and last period of their student life, have as a result of the five-year education they receive, was carried out with the qualitative research method interview technique. As a result of the interviews, multiple changes in attitudes and behaviors such as the extinction of radicalism in the positive direction, the increase of tolerance, the acquisition of a critical and understanding perspective, and the formation of different dimensions of religiosity have been identified through the social environment and knowledge acquired by the students.

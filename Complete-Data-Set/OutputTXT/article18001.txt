Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the thymus in different age groups using multidedector computed tomography
Özet: Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the morphological properties of the thymus in different age groups. Methods: 306 multidedector computed tomography (MDCT) images were retrospectively evaluated between 2014–2017 and 181 images (mean age: 51.093±18.631). Results: The mean volume of thymus in males was significantly higher than in females (p<0.05). The arrowhead shape was the most frequent type (71.27%). The thymus was mostly located at the level of T4–5 vertebrate (44.20%). The thymus tend to be more inferiorly located with an increase in age, being at T6–7 vertebrate level. The thymus was most frequently located left to the midsagittal plane (74.03%). Volume of the thymus was noticed to increase with age; however, it was noted to decrease after 50–59 years of age. Conclusion: In majority of the cases, the thymus was observed to be located left to midline the at the T4–5 vertebrate level. The volume of the thymus tend to decrease after age of 50 and tend to have a more inferior position.

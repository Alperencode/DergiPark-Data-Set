Makale Başlığı: COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF EMOTIONAL AND RATIONAL MESSAGES ON THE PAY-AS-YOU- WANT (PWYW) PRICING STRATEGY: THE EXAMPLE OF LÖSEV
Özet: The aim of this study is to test whether emotional and rational advertising messages have a significant effect on the pay-what-you-want  (PWYW) pricing strategy in the context of charity (LÖSEV) products. Within the framework of these purposes, the relational comparative model was preferred. The relational comparative model is counted as one of the quantitative research methods and is included in the general survey model. The universe of the study consists of the X generation, who live in Turkey and are between the ages of 43-57. As a result of the field research conducted by applying the questionnaire technique, data were collected from 335 people belonging to the X generation. The results obtained from the study show that, contrary to the rational individual (homoeconomicus) advocated by the mainstream economics, individuals declare their intention to pay more for LÖSEV products by thinking of others instead of maximizing their own interests with the effect of emotional and rational messages. As a result of the comparisons, it has been determined that rational messages create more willingness to pay than emotional messages.

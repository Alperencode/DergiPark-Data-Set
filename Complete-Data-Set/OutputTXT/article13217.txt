Makale Başlığı: The Precursor Relationship Between Married Individuals’ Values, Attachment and Appearance Anxiety
Özet: The aim of this research is to investigate the precursor relationship between values, attachment styles, and appearance anxiety of married individuals. Structural equation modeling analysis has been carried out in order to test the relationship among values, attachment, and social appearance anxiety variables in the research. Structural equation modeling analysis has been carried out with AMOS 19 program. In the research, the “Personal Information Form” to collect the necessary data, the “Values Scale'' to determine the values of married individuals, ''Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory-I'' to determine the attachment styles of married individuals, and "Social Appearance Anxiety" scales to determine appearance anxiety were used. Percentage and frequency calculations of the collected data have been created with the SPSS 18 package program. According to the analysis results obtained from the study, it has been seen that there is a meaningful negative relationship when the precursor relationships between values and appearance anxiety are examined. In other words, it has been concluded that as the values of individuals increase, their appearance concerns will decrease. Additionally, when the precursor relationships between attachment styles of married individuals and appearance anxiety are examined, it has been determined that there is a positive linear relationship.  Accordingly, it has been determined that individuals' attachment styles will positively affect their appearance anxiety.

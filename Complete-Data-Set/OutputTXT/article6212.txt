Özet: The aim of this research is to examine the direct and indirect relations between self-efficacy perception, job satisfaction and employee performance. In this direction, a face-to-face and online questionnaire was applied to 198 academics working at Kilis 7 Aralık University. After the factor and reliability analyses were made via the SPSS Program on the data as a result of the survey, the hypotheses were tested with the models created with the SPSS Process Macro plugin. According to the results of the regression analysis, it is determined that the effect of self-efficacy perception on internal and external satisfaction and employee performance is positive and statistically significant. The effect of internal satisfaction on employee performance is positive and statistically significant, but the effect of external satisfaction on employee performance is not statistically significant. According to the results obtained from the Bootstrap method, which is used to determine the direct and indirect effects between the variables, the indirect effect of self-efficacy perception on employee performance through internal satisfaction is statistically significant. The indirect effect of self-efficacy perception on employee performance through external satisfaction is not statistically significant. It has been determined that internal satisfaction has a moderate partial mediation role in the relation between self-efficacy perception and employee performance.

Makale Başlığı: A Technical Analysis of Yūsuf al-Qaʿīd's al-Ḥarb fī Barr Miṣr
Özet: Yūsuf al-Qaʿīd is one of the most important Egyptian writers of the 20th century. One of his most famous novels, al-Ḥarb fī Barr Miṣr, was published in Beirut in 1978, as it was not allowed to be published in his home country, Egypt. al-Ḥarb fī Barr Miṣr ranks fourth in the list of the hundred best Arabic novels. The work was also adapted to the cinema under the name of al-Muwātin al-Miṣrī in 1991. In general, the main focus of the novel is to tragically reveal the different faces of Egypt by describing the corruption, abuse and injustice in the social and political fields in Egypt during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. It focuses on how dangerous a situation it is, especially since corruption and degenerateness in social areas can cause social disintegration. al-Ḥarb fī Barr Miṣr is about ʿUmde (village headman), a rich man with political authority who tries to find illegal methods to send someone else to enlist instead of his 'spoiled' son, and Maṣrī (the son of the village guard) who had to go to the army instead of 'Umde's son due to financial impossibilities and martyred in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. In this study, it is aimed to examine the novel scientifically.

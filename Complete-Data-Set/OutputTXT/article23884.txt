Makale Başlığı: A Novel Method of Hybrid Ossiculoplasty: Ionomer Bone Cement Coated Mastoid Cortical Bone
Özet: Objective: The development of otologic surgical techniques has significantly improved the functional results of surgery. However, the issue of the most  effective  ossiculoplasty  material  is  still  controversial.  The  study  aimed  to  introduce  a  novel  method  of  autologous  ossiculoplasty,  using  “ionomer bone cement coated mastoid cortical bone” and to assess short-term and long-term results of this method. Material and Methods: The study presented a retrospective, consecutive case series of twelve patients who underwent revision surgery as type IV tympanoplasty using Mastoid cortical bone coated with ionomer bone cement in our institution between January 2013 and December 2019. Coating with ionomer bone cement was performed to prevent the autograft from sticking to the surrounding bone tissue. The short- and long-term auditory functions and otologic examination findings of the patients were analyzed. Results:  Physical  examination  findings  were  satisfactory.  Except  one,  all  patients  had  a  significant  improvement  in  hearing  outcomes,  and  the  late-term results were also satisfactory. An average long term audiological gain of 19.9 dB (± 8.7 SD) was found. Conclusion: A novel method of Hybrid Ossiculoplasty: Ionomer Bone Cement Coated Mastoid Cortical Bone is an effective and safe method of ossiculoplasty. It can be easily eliminated one of the major disadvantages of mastoid cortical bone by coating it with ionomer bone cement.

Makale Başlığı: Lake Van Basin during the Chalcolithic Period: Yılantaş and other Survey Sites
Özet: This article is based on the Chalcolithic evidence of our survey campaigns in the Lake Van basin. The material from previous and as well as current researches is discussed together. Investigations on the Chalcolithic period in the eastern Anatolian highland are scarce. Excavations at the mounds of Sos VA, Pulur and Alaybeyi in the north-eastern Anatolia, and Tilkitepe I-III located on the south-eastern shore of Lake Van and surveys in the region yielded limited data. The Chalcolithic period is mainly situated in mounds on the plains and river valleys in lowlands and on the eastern shoreline of Lake Van. The characteristics of pottery indicate that the Lake Van basin is within the chaff-faced ware horizon; it also has a regional group of and painted ware (Tilkitepe ware, also chaff-faced).

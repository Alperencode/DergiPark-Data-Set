Makale Başlığı: The Problem of Unrhymed Couplets in Süheyl u Nevbahâr
Özet: Structural features such as rhyme, redif, meter, etc. used in historical  texts written in verse are important for the correct reading of these texts.  Because the structures in question in verse texts are helpful elements in the  reading of the texts and shed light on this issue. However, it is an inevitable  fact that the scribes sometimes make spelling mistakes in historical texts.  At times, it can take a long time to correct these misspellings that we  encounter in their texts. For such correction proposals, morphological  features such as rhyme, redif, and alliteration or verse sometimes used  in the text can be used. Sometimes, it may be possible to reach correct  results by making comparisons based on similar language structures in  the text for correction proposals. This article focuses on some couplets that seem to have no rhyme due  to spelling mistakes in the text of Süheyl u Nevbahâr masnavi. The article  also offers reading suggestions on the aforementioned spelling mistakes.  These typographical errors found in the text of Süheyl u Nevbahâr point  to the bottom copy and also show that the copies in hand belong to a later period.

Makale Başlığı: A Review on The Role Of Spiders In Biological Control
Özet: Due to the negative effects of pesticides used in agricultural fields on the environment and living beings, new methods such as Integrated Pest Management stand out in the struggle against pests. Biological Control is one of the most important parts of Integrated Pest Management that integrates mechanical, cultural, and biological practices. Biological Control is known as a method of struggle that allows the pest density to be maintained at the desired level using carnivorous predators, which are natural enemies of pests. Spiders in these predators; it is important for Biological Control due to its characteristics such as various strategies, different habitat preferences, active period differences, ability to consume a large number of preys in unit time and adapt to long hunger periods. Studies indicate that spiders reduce aphids in wheat, moths and aphids in apple orchards, dipterans in olive orchards, and psyllid in pear orchards. In the absence of spiders, the density of pests increases. Cannibalism among spiders and the feeding of spider communities with other natural enemies can decimate Biological Control. For this reason, it is of great importance to conduct more studies on the characteristics of spiders such as hunting strategies, feeding preferences, habitat preferences in order to contribute to their more effective use in Biological Control.

Makale Başlığı: Effect of Glukagon-Like Peptide-1 Analog Liraglutide On Neural Tube Development In Chick Embryo Model
Özet: The aim of this study is to scan different doses of Liraglutid on the neural tube in a chick embryo model, which is similar to first month development in mammals. 100 eggs of 61 ± 5 gr, specific pathogen-free 0 day white fertilized chicken eggs were used. Incubation of 28 hours was maintained at a constant temperature of 37.5 ± 0.5°C, humidity in the range of 60 – 68%. They were divided into 4 groups of 25 eggs each. Liraglutid was administered subblastodermically with a Hamilton micro-injector in 3 different doses. The control group was injected with 0.9% sterile saline, and the experimental groups were injected with liraglutide at doses of 1.5, 7.5 and 15 µg/egg. After the injection, the windows were closed with sterile drape and left for incubation. At the end of 48 hours of incubation, all eggs were hatched and evaluated on the basis of Hamburger-Hamilton scale. In the study, neural tube patency, somite numbers, and Hamburger-Hamilton stages were examined, it was determined that the dose-related difference between the control and experimental groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05). It was determined that the difference between the high dose group and the other groups in terms of fore-aft lengths was statistically significant (P<0.05). As a result, there was no significant relationship between the doses of Liraglutide and neural tube patency and somite counts, but differences were found between fore-aft measurements. Further research is recommended for a clearer understanding of the effects of liraglutide on embryo development.

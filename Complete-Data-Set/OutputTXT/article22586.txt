Makale Başlığı: Determining the Effect on Performance Characteristics of Recycled Cotton Fiber Ratio in Single Jersey Knitted Fabrics
Özet: Minimization and recycling of wastes in the textile industry is an issue that has been emphasized in recent years. Recycling of pre-consumer and post-consumer wastes has started to be widely preferred, especially in the textile sector. In this study, properties such as density, weight, thickness, air permeability, fabric stiffness and bursting strength of recycled cotton blended single jersey knitted fabrics were determined according to standards and the effectiveness of the recycling rate was evaluated according to the results obtained. It has been determined that as the recycling rate increases, the bursting strength decreases, the air permeability increases and the fabric hardness decreases in recycled cotton-added knitted fabrics.

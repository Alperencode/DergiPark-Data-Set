Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of Stretching and Balance Exercises on Functional Movements in Volleyball Players Aged 12-14 Years
Özet: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an 8-weeks stretching and balance exercise programmes on the functional movements in female volleyball players. 34 female volleyball players participated voluntarily in this study (Experimental group n=17; age 13.70±0.46 years; body weight 63.09±6.08 kg; height 173.76±5.05 cm; Control group n=17; age 13.64±0.49 years; body weight 60.31±4.91 kg; height 171.02±6.62 cm). For 8 weeks, the volleyball players in the control group continued their routine training programmes, while the volleyball players in the experimental group applied the stretching and balance exercise programmes in addition to their routine training programmes. Functional Movement Screen (FMS™) consisting of seven different functional movements was applied to the athletes at the 0th and 8th weeks. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Independent Samples T-test, and intra-group differences were analyzed using the Paired Samples T-test. While there was no significant difference in any variable between the pretests of the experimental and control groups (p>0.05); among the posttests, statistically highly significant results were found in the variables of right rotary stability, left rotary stability and FMS™ total point (t=2.954, p=0.006; t=3.411, p=0.002; t=4.162, p=0.000, respectively). The total FMS™ points of all the participants in the study were found to be ≥14. This showed low risk of injury in the participants. In conclusion, the stretching and balance exercise programmes can be beneficial in teaching and developing correct and effective movement patterns, especially starting at a young age.

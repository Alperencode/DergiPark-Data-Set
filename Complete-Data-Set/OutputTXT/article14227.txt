Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Innovation and Economic Growth: Panel Cointegration and Panel Causality Analysis
Özet: This paper aims to examine the relationship between innovation and economic growth. For this purpose, panel cointegration and causality analysis were applied to 36 developed and developing countries from 1996-2018. According to the study results, economic growth positively affects the number of patent applications (PA) and composed innovation index (CII). In contrast, economic growth does not affect the number of patent cooperation treaty (PCT) documents. On the other hand, the results show that while PA and PCT documents positively affect economic growth, the CII does not significantly affect economic growth.

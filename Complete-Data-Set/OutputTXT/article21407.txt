Makale Başlığı: An optimized FPGA design of inverse quantization and transform for HEVC  decoding blocks and validation in an SW/HW environment
Özet: This paper presents an optimized hardware architecture of the inverse quantization and the inverse transform   IQ/IT  for a high-efficiency video coding  HEVC  decoder. Our highly parallel and pipelined architecture was designed  to support all HEVC Transform Unit  TU  sizes: 4 × 4, 8 × 8, 16 × 16, and 32 × 32. The IQ/IT was described in the  VHSIC hardware description language and synthesized to Xilinx XC7Z020 field-programmable gate array  FPGA  and to  TSMC 180 nm standard-cell library. The throughput of the hardware architecture reached in the worst case a processing  rate of up to 1080 p at 33 fps at 146 MHz and 1080 p at 25 fps at 110 MHz when mapped to FPGA and standardcells,  respectively. The validation of our architecture was conducted on the ZC702 platform using a Software/Hardware   SW/HW  enviro nment in order to evaluate different implementation methods  SW and SW/HW  in terms of power  consumption and run-time. The experimental results demonstrate that the SW/HW accelerations were enhanced by  more than 70% in terms of the run-time speed relative to the SW solution. Besides, the power consumption of the  SW/HW designs was reduced by nearly 60% compared with the SW case.

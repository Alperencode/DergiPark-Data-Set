Makale Başlığı: USING METAPHOR IN HYPNOSIS
Özet: Purpose: Metaphor has been found to be almost as old as language itself, according to research. Metaphors help people better convey what they want to say. In hypnotherapy, metaphor is commonly employed since it is both catchy and impressive. When we look at the history of hypnosis, which is one of the traditional and complementary medicine approaches, we can see that it was used long before modern medicine was understood, and it was used to cure physical and mental illnesses in individuals. Because hypnotherapy conducted by experts has practically no side effects and produces speedy results when compared to other therapeutic methods, it has become a well-known and widely utilized approach in the medical world. The efficacy of hypnosis recommendations is highly dependent on language patterns. As a result, this research has collated the usage of metaphors in hypnosis.Materials and Methods: In this study, information about metaphor and hypnosis was collected by reviewing the literature, and a compilation was made about the use of metaphor in hypnosis in light of this information. Conclusion: One of the most distinguishing features of hypnosis from other therapies is that it is a state of consciousness that must be learned. The language used in hypnosis is of great importance as the critical factor between consciousness and subconscious is bypassed while the person is in a trance state. The use of metaphors in treatment, particularly hypnotherapy, improves its efficacy. In this regard, the use of metaphors in hypnosis and hypnotherapy applications should be expanded, as should the number of research studies required on this subject.

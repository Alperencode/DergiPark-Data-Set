Makale Başlığı: Erythema Nodosum after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccine; a case report
Özet: Erythema Nodosum (EN) is a panniculitis characterized by acute-onset inflammation of the subcutaneous fat tissue; it can be idiopathic or associated with various clinical conditions such as infections (especially Beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections), medications, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel diseases, Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. The pathogenesis is unknown, but a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to certain antigens is hypothesized [1]. EN is characterized clinically by painful tender, nodular, erythematous lesions, typically symmetrically on pretibial surfaces. The occurrence of EN after vaccination is rare and especially post-covid vaccine limited number in the literature. We describe herein, a clinical observation of EN induced by Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccine.

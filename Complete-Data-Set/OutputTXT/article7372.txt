Makale Başlığı: OPTIMIZATION OF 3D PROCESSING PARAMETERS USED FDM METHOD IN THE PRODUCTION OF ABS BASED SAMPLES
Özet: Manufacturing with 3D printers is a very complex process due to many input parameters. This situation makes it difficult to determine optimum production parameters. In this study; hen the production of ABS materials with the fused deposition method (FDM) in 3D printers, the effects of process parameters, which are infill density (50%, 70%, and 90%), fill pattern (linear, octagonal and honeycomb), and layer thickness (0.19mm, 0.29mm and 0.39mm) were investigated on surface roughness, tensile strength, and manufacturing times by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The most effective process parameter on the output parameters was the layer thickness. While the decreasing layer thickness had a positive effect on the surface roughness and tensile strength, it had a negative effect on the manufacturing time. In the experiments carried out according to the Taguchi L27 (33) experimental design, since three different output parameters were evaluated in the optimization process, the gray relational degree was used as the evaluation criterion in the multiple performance optimizations. The optimum processing parameter was determined as linear fill pattern, 90% infill density and 0.19 mm layer thickness.

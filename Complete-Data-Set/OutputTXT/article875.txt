Özet: At the time of competition, athletes experience instant emotional change and stress in the face of both adaptation and change demands. Therefore, athletes need skills such as cognitive control and cognitive flexibility to control their aggression and anger during stress while competing. From this point of view, the research aims to determine the role of cognitive control over emotions, evaluation and coping flexibility in aggression and anger in sports and to examine their relationships according to some variables. The study group of the research consists of a total of 442 athletes, 205 females (46.4%) and 237 males (53.6%). "Competitive Aggressiveness and Anger Scale" and "Cognitive Control and Flexibility Scale" were used in the research. Descriptive statistics, MANOVA Test and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used for data analysis. In the findings of the research, it was seen that the aggression mean scores of males were high, and anger and aggression mean scores were higher in athletes who smokes and used alcohol. Another important result of the study is that cognitive control over emotions and evaluation and coping flexibility explain 17% of the total variance in aggression and anger in sports. In particular, it can be said that cognitive control over emotions has a higher effect on determining aggression and anger in sports.

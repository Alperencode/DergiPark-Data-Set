Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Pre-Service Science Teachers’ Learning Experiences on Educational Robotics Applications
Özet: The purpose of this study is to examine the learning experiences of pre-service science teachers on educational robotic applications. Within the scope of this study, both block-based coding and robotic coding activities were carried out. In this study, case study, one of the qualitative research designs, was used. The research was carried out within the scope of Technology and Project Design course in Gazi University Department of Science Education. The research group of the study consists of pre-service science teachers of the Department of Science Education (n=46). A structured interview form was developed by the researchers to collect pre-service teachers' views on the activity. In order to analyze the data obtained from the interviews, descriptive content analysis was made and categories related to student thoughts were created. To ensure the reliability of the categories, 2 field experts analyzed the codes separately and Krippendorff’s alpha is used for the reliability of the analyzes. It was calculated as .81. It is seen that the majority of pre-service teachers have not participated in a robotic coding course or such an activity before. So, it is found that such a course creates significant positive contributions to them.

Makale Başlığı: An Overview of Covid 19 in the View of Healthcare Professionals/Providers in Turkey
Özet: The recent Covid-19 pandemic first appeared in China in the last months of 2019 and affected the whole world. The first Covid-19 case in our country was seen on March 11, 2020, and it spread throughout the country in a short time. Within this period, the Ministry of Health has actively struggled with healthcare personnel by determining extremely active measures and treatment methods. With the current study, it aimed to evaluate the perspective of healthcare personnel on the Covid-19 virus in the months when the cases increased. For this purpose, data were collected from physicians, dentists, midwives, nurses, health officers, medical technicians, laboratory technicians, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and other staff consisting of 1062 people working for the Ministry of Health in Turkey. In the data analysis process, SEM based on least squares regression was used in the study, and the analysis was conducted with Smart PLS 3.9 program. As a result of the study, the psychological, behavioural, risk perception and attitudes of the healthcare personnel towards Covid-19 were evaluated. They stated that healthcare professionals are at the risk of Covid-19, that they can infect themselves and infect their families despite taking protective measures, that they should cooperate with experts in the fight against the Covid-19 virus, and that citizens do not comply with protective measures in terms of transmission of the virus.

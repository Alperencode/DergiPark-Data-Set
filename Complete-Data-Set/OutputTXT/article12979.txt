Makale Başlığı: Analysis of vibration exposure of vehicles during passing through speed bumps
Özet: Traffic accidents cause serious financial losses as well as many deaths. This situation negatively affects societies both materially and spiritually. The vast majority of traffic accidents are caused by excessive speed. Especially due to the large number of people and vehicles in the city, excessive speed can have more severe consequences than the roads outside the city. One of the methods applied to reduce speeding in the city is the use of speed bumps. Thanks to these speed bumps, vehicles can be prevented from reaching high speeds. If the speed breakers that are planned to be implemented are not made according to certain standards, they negatively affect driver and passenger comfort. In this study, a total of 10 speed breakers, three of which are ready-made rubber bumps, five of which are speed humps and two of which are of the raised pedestrian crossing type, were investigated for compliance with the design standards. Precise measurements were made with the measuring device to determine the real three-dimensional shapes of the speed breakers. The experiments were carried out at speeds of 15- 20- 25- 30 and 35 km/h, provided that two or four people were in the vehicle for each speed breaker. 70x3 triaxial accelerometer was used for acceleration measurements. As a result of the vibration measurements, it has been revealed that only one speed bump is suitable for comfort conditions. It was stated that it would be more beneficial for both driver and passenger comfort if other existing speed bumps were reviewed and built in accordance with design standards.

Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT BORON APPLICATIONS ON SEED YIELD AND SOME AGRONOMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RED LENTIL
Özet: This study is to determine the effect of different boron application methods to grain yield and some agricultural properties of Sakar red lentil variety (Lens culinaris Medic.). Study was conducted in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 growing years in the Boron lack areas of Sanliurfa in Turkey. Experimental design was randomized complete block design with four replicates. Borax and Sakar lentil variety were used as Boron source and plant material, respectively. The methods of applying boron were control (0 kg B da-1), to soil (0.20 kg B da-1), to foliar spraying (when plants have 5-6 leaves 0.05 kg da-1 and have pre-flowering period 0.05 kg da-1) and to soil+foliar application (to soil 0.10 kg B da-1 + to foliar when plants have 5-6 leaves 0.05 kg da-1 and have pre-flowering period 0.05 kg da-1). According to average of two years; the highest grain yield was obtained from soil+foliar aplications (198.57 kg da-1). Also the highest harvest index (33.96%), thousand kernel weight (41.78 g), biological yield (582.96 g/m2) values were seen on soil+foliar applications. Protein content of kernel (33.29 %) and the boron content of kernel (19.09 mg kg-1) values increased with boron applications at the average of two years. The most effective boron application method was determined as soil + foliar boron application but other application methods were more effective than control parcels.

Makale Başlığı: THE DİSABİLİTY RİGHTS MOVEMENTS: ITS DEVELOPMENT, DEMANDS AND SOCİAL CONTEXT AS AN ACTİVİST MOVEMENT
Özet: The disability rights movement emerged only in the 1960s as an appeal to the problems and barriers that people with disabilities have experienced for centuries. While disability has been considered a punishment for moral depression in the early stages, it has been started to be considered a pathology and anomaly with the development of science and the emergence of rational thinking, leading to treatment of these individuals with applied disciplines such as medicine and rehabilitation. According to this understanding, individuals with disabilities have been closed to various institutions, and the resulting discrimination, barriers, and prejudices in the social context have not been seen as part of the problem. The disability rights movement, on the other hand, opposes the discriminatory, stigmatizing, and exclusionary practices of this medical reductionist approach and advocates that the source of the problems experienced should be sought in the social and cultural structure, not in the body of the actors. Thus, the disability rights movement demanded that individuals with disabilities should have equal citizenship rights, live independently and that their views and opinions should be taken into account in the regulations related to them. In addition, the movement has fought for the construction of new disability culture and identity by removing social barriers in front of individuals with disabilities. Therefore, this study focuses on the development, struggle areas and demands of the disability rights movement.

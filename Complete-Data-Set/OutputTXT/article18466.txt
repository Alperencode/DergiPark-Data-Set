Makale Başlığı: Comparison Of Shear Bond Strength And Adhesive Remnant Index Between Different Adhesive Systems In Bonding and Rebonding of Orthodontic Brackets
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the shear bond strength (SBS) and adhesive remnant index of stainless-steel brackets bonded with different orthodontic adhesive systems.Materials and Methods: In our study performed on 60 premolar teeth extracted for orthodontic reasons, MBT prescription 0.022'' stainless-steel brackets  (Discovery Smart®, Dentaurum, Germany) were used. In teeth randomly divided into 3 groups, bonding was performed with Group 1: Trulock Light Activated Bonding System (RMO, USA), Group 2: Bisco Ortho Bracket Paste LC (Bisco, USA), Group 3: Transbond XT Light Cure Adhesive (3M, USA). SBS and residual adhesive indexes (ARI) were evaluated by breaking the samples. Adhesive residues were cleaned with tungsten carbide burs from the surfaces of the teeth, rebonding was made after sanding the brackets’ surfaces. SBS and ARI values were re-evaluated. One-way ANOVA, two-sample t-test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis of the data, p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between Group 1 and Group 2 in comparison to the first SBS values of three different orthodontic adhesive systems to enamel (p <0.05). Among the adhesive systems, only a statistically significant difference was found between the first bonding values and the rebonding values of Group 2 (p <0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the first and rebond strengths of the other two adhesive systems. Rebonding values of three different orthodontic adhesive systems were very close to each other.Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the adhesive systems developed for the bonding of orthodontic brackets to the enamel can show clinically enough bond strength even if the rebonding strengths of the falling stainless-steel brackets  to the same enamel surfaces decrease slightly.

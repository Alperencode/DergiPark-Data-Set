Makale Başlığı: Nutritional Assessment and Proximate Analysis of Selected Vegetables Grown in Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan
Özet: Food security and protection are the most crucial concerns worldwide. However, vegetables may significantly contribute to the macro and micro-nutrients for good health compared to dietary supplements. Eight vegetables of the Larkanadivision, namely spinach (Spinacia oleracea), brinjal (Solanum melongina L.), sponge gourd (Luffa acutangula), lotus root (Lelumbo nucifera), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), coriander leave (Coriandrum sativum), fenugreek leave (Trigonella foenum graecum), and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) were studied for their proximate, macro and micro-mineral contents to estimate their importance in human nutrition. The results showed that almost all vegetables contain appreciable amounts of essential nutrients. All the vegetables showed moisture contents of >70.00%. Lotus and sponge gourd have a maximum level of carbohydrates (>10.00%). Fiber was found in the range of 2.70 – 5.10%, with the highest in the okra. Protein and fat were found at < 4.00%, with maximum protein in spinach and fat in fenugreek leaves. The studied vegetables showed maximum levels of K and Ca, followed by Na, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Cu while Cr and Mn were observed to be < 5.00 µg/g. The macro and micro-minerals in the studied vegetables were within the maximum permissible limits recommended by WHO. Moreover, the eight studied vegetables of the Larkana division can also provide up to 1.00% of the required dietary daily intake of macro and micro-nutrients as recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board.

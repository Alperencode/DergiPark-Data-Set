It has interdisciplinary data with different qualities in terms of history, collection and photography, it is invaluable. The photo collection was created by collecting photographs taken by many photographers within the framework of a certain philosophy. This aspect also needs to be studied academically. While researching the subject, it was seen that collecting is a modern and essential activity. It is seen that attempts to record the tangible and intangible cultural heritage continue uninterruptedly as a reflection of protecting the history of civilizations as it continues today and before. It is functional as both the subject and the object of this approach in photography. In Turkey, determinations have been made about photography collectors and photography collections. It is Mustafa Kemal's constant photographing of the events that took place before and after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, which led to the emergence of this collection. This is an indication of his modern consciousness. It is one of the reasons for the creation of the Benazus collection. The respect, love and admiration of Benazus for this modern consciousness enabled such a collection to be established. The subject has been examined through digital correspondence on different dates with Benazus. While this collection is protected, it should be brought up to the quality of a contemporary photographic collection.

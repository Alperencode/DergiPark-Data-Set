Makale Başlığı: A method for analyzing suspect-filler similarity using convolutional neural networks
Özet: Eyewitness misidentifications are one of the leading factors in wrongful convictions. This study focuses on the structure of the lineups, which is one of the factors that cause misidentification, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the selection of fillers to be included in the lineups. In the study, AI-based face recognition systems are used to determine the level of similarity of fillers to the suspect. Using two different face recognition models with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure, similarity threshold values close to human performance were calculated (VGG Face and Cosine similarity = 0.383, FaceNet and Euclidean l2 = 1.16). In the second part of the study, the problems that are likely to be caused by facial recognition systems used in the selection of fillers are examined. The results of the study reveal that models responsible for facial recognition may not suffice alone in the selection of fillers and, an advanced structure using CNN models trained to recognize other attributes (race, gender, age, etc.) associated with similarity along with face recognition models would produce more accurate results. In the last part of the study, a Line-up application that can analyze attributes such as facial similarity, race, gender, age, and facial expression, is introduced.

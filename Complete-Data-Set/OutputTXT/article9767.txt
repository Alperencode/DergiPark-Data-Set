Makale Başlığı: A Meta-Analytic Review in the Tourism and Hospitality Literature: Antecedents of Intention to Qui
Özet: This study examines the major antecedents of turnover intention and their interrelationships. The primary goal of this study is to determine the effect sizes of the surveyed associations through the use of meta-analysis. Scopus, GoogleScholar, and Web of Science databases were examined for 3,927 studies. This meta-analysis draws on 42 relevant studies. The research was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The results of the analysis indicate that both the association between work satisfaction and intention to leave (r=-0.515) and the relationship between organizational commitment and desire to leave (r=-0.508) have a high and negative effect size. Empowerment and turnover intention have a moderate and negative effect size (r=-0.405). However, organizational dedication has a significant positive effect on job satisfaction (0.659). The findings indicate that employment type acts as a moderator in the link between work satisfaction and intention to quit. Additionally, the type of workplace acts as a moderator in the association between organizational commitment and intention to resign, and in the relationship between organizational commitment and job satisfaction. It is extremely rare for moderators to be identified in a meta-analysis study. This study identified major modifiers and outcomes, and contributed to the body of knowledge. The study’s findings can be applied by managers in the tourism and hospitality industries.

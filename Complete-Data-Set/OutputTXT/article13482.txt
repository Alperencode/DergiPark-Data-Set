Makale Başlığı: Diffuse Intrinsic Pons Glioma in Children: A Single Center Experience
Özet: AimThe aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical findings and treatment outcomes of our patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).Patient and methodsWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of children with DIPG at Ondokuz Mayıs University Faculty of Medicine Children's Hospital between 2000 and 2016. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were used to evaluate data.ResultsTwenty one children were included in the study; the median age of diagnosis was 9.4 years (2.9-15.7 years) and 13 were boys and 8 were girls. While all patients received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, nimotuzumab and vinorelbine treatment were also given since 2010 (6 patients). The median survival time was 15.8 months (6-262 months); survival rates were 81%, 33.3%, 23.8% and 9.5% at the 1st year, 18th month, 24th month and 5th year, respectively. The 2-year survival rate for those who received nimotuzumab was 33.3%, while it was 20% for those who did not (p: 0.78). The median survival was 17.9 months (5.8-85.1 months) in those who received nimotuzumab and 15.8 months (9.3-262.1 months) in those who did not (p: 0.808).ConclusionSurvival rates are still low in brain stem gliomas and radiotherapy remains the main and effective treatment option. However, a better understanding of its molecular genetics, promising preclinical models, and new techniques that cross the blood-brain barrier are expected to contribute positively to survival.

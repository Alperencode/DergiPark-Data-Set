Makale Başlığı: Examination of Knowledge and Stress Levels of Patients and Reasons for the Application for Dental Treatments during COVID-19 Pandemic
Özet: Background: This study was conducted to examine the stress levels of individuals who admitted for dental treatment during the normalization process of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of knowledge about the COVID-19 and the reasons of admission for treatment. Methods: 990 people aged between 18-60+, who admitted to the Dentistry Faculty, participated in the study. The questionnaire directed to individuals consisted of questions measuring their democratic knowledge, reasons for applying for dental treatment and their stress levels. Analysis of the data in the study was evaluated using the Pearson Chi-Square test (p<0.05).  Results: The most common reason for admission was tooth decay (40.1%), followed by toothache (35.6%). While there was no statistically significant difference between gender and COVID-19 knowledge levels, a positive correlation was found between age and education level and knowledge level. While 29.6% of the patients participating in our study stated that they did not have any stress during their dental treatments, 29.1% stated that they were little stressful, 28% were stressful, and 13% were very stressful. Conclusions: Although individuals have a high level of knowledge about COVID-19, the stress caused by the risk of transmission can cause individuals to delay their dental treatment.

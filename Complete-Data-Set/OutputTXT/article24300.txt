Özet: The economic turmoil, political events occurred in 1970s and 1980s and the globalization caused a shift from the welfare state approach to the New Public Management approach since the 1990s. This approach has spreaded first in the USA then in European countries and other countries, and has started to come to the fore since the beginning of the 2000s in Turkey. The procurements to settle the approach in public institutions such as Public Finance Management and Control Law (No: 5018) leads the concept of strategic planning to take place in Turkish public administration, Metropolitan Municipality Law (No: 5216) and Municipality Law (No: 5393) obligate the municipalities, that have a population of over 50.000, to prepare strategic plans immediately after the local elections. In this study, the official website Ministry of Development www.sp.gov.tr is examined and it is found that 49 metropolitan municipalities, provincial municipalities and municipal municipalities have prepared the 3-period strategic plan. Among these 49 municipalities, 8 municipalities (Bursa, Diyarbakır, Kadıköy, Zeytinburnu, Maltepe, Altındağ, Çorlu, Amasya) that prepared strategic plans in periods of 2006 - 2009, 2010-2014 and 2015-2019 after the local elections were selected.The goal of this study is to show whether 24 strategic plans of eight municipalities have been prepared in accordance with the "Strategic Planning Guide for Public Administrations".

Makale Başlığı: Recommendation of Active Employment Policy Based on Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation: Social Entrepreneurship Support Model for Youth in Turkey
Özet: In this study, the social entrepreneurship support model will be designed in Turkey as an active employment policy proposal based on entrepreneurship and social innovation in the fight against youth unemployment. Within this framework, the model aims to organize a social entrepreneurship training program for unemployed youth and NEET (neither employed nor in education or training) youth by the Turkish Public Employment Agency (ISKUR). Based on this, it is envisaged that similar support to the ISKUR Entrepreneurship Training Program implemented by the state for young people will be implemented under the name of the Social Entrepreneurship Support Program in cooperation with ISKUR-KOSGEB and ASHOKA. The model also suggests to give financial and consultancy support for those who successfully complete training. This support is thought to be important for start-up social entrepreneurs. Finally, this study aims to discuss the possibility to implement a social entrepreneurship support model for youth in Turkey. Especially in terms of developing countries, the model is believed to be an alternative means of struggle with the fight against youth unemployment.

Makale Başlığı: Cognitive Linguistics with Its Theoretical Aspects
Özet: With the emergence of human-centered approaches in language since the second half of 20th century, language has started to be examined with cognitive approaches. The cognitive science researchers believing that language, thought and human are completely interrelated concepts focus on language that is a tool to explain thought and cognition structure while examining mental processes of human, and hence cognitive sciences intersect with linguistics. During the last twenty years of the 20th century, cognitive science emerged at the intersection of interdisciplinary cognitive sciences such as psychology, philosophy, logic and mathematics. The departing point of this study results from the lack of a detailed study in Turkish literature regarding content, key concepts, historical development, purpose, duties and approaches of cognitive linguistics, which has an important field of study in the world. In this study, cognitive linguistics will be discussed theoretically. The novelty and significance of this study results from the fact that it will be described with its main aspects theoretical analysis of cognitive linguistics in terms of Russian sources. As the method of the research, the descriptive and comparative method will be used.

Makale Başlığı: Effect of eradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori on complete blood count and inflammatory parameters
Özet: Background and aims: Previously Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) infection was held responsible for changes in complete blood count and inflammatory parameters. But changes in these parameters after eradication treatment was not entirely evaluated. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of eradication threatment for H. pylori infection on inflammatory markers and complete blood count parameters. Materials and method: This single center observational study enrolled participants who came to internal medicine outpatient clinics because of dyspeptic complaints and who were diagnosed to have H. pylori infection after endoscopic evaluation, between July 2021 and January 2022. Participants who were tested negative for H. pylori stool antigen test eight weeks after eradication treatment were included. Complete blood count and infammatory parameters before and after eradication treatment were compared. Results: Mean participant age was 43.84±12.59 years. There were significant decreases in C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophile to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) after eradication. Changes in platelet counts and mean platelet volumes (MPV) were insignificant. Conclusion: CRP, PLR and NLR were significantly lower after eradication for H. pylori. These parameters may be useful, simple, available and non-invasive tests that may be used in evaluation of eradication treatment for H. pylori.

Makale Başlığı: The Rights of Chidren with Disabilities in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
Özet: There is no special law regarding the rights of children with disabilities in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. However, the TRNC accepted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2010 and made it a part of its domestic law. In this study, the status of children with disabilities living in the TRNC is mentioned, legal gaps are pointed out, and especially references are made to the decision taken in the world on the basis of international law. In conclusion, it was emphasized that the legislature should  fill the legal gaps immediately and make regu- lations in line with the rising demands in order to make the disabled children more visible in all areas of social life in the TRNC. In this context, it was stated that the legal and administrative regulations made by the Republic of Turkey is a great opportunity for the TRNC. It was emphasized that the guarantee of the rights of children with disabilities in the TRNC will be strengthened with the support of Turkey, with programs on the basis of mutual cooperation to be established in further studies. In addition, the Disabled Education Law (from birth to 21 years of age), the introduction of aggravated penalties for crimes committed in terms of criminal offenses such as bullying, violence, and assault against the disabled (under the Human Rights Law to be established), Special Directive for Services for Disabled Families and Educators, for the Physically and Mentally Disabled Education Act, should be prepared in the Assembly of TRNC. In addition, there is not even the draft Disabled Caregivers Act to take care of children with disabilities in TRNC. It has been stated that the Special Education Law, which is stated to be a draft, cannot produce a solution on its own, considering the Republic of Turkey and international conventions.

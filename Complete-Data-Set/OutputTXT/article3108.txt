Makale Başlığı: Encephalocele: Retrospective Analysis and Our Clinical Experience
Özet: Encephalocele is defined as extracranial herniation of the CSF, meninges, or cerebral tissue through a midline fusion defect in the cranium. The aim of this article is to present the clinical experience of the authors on encephalocele management. A total of 19 patients who underwent surgery for encephalocele in our hospital between 2015 and 2021 were included in the study. We reached 7 cases who were diagnosed with encephalocele and underwent pregnancy termination between 2018 and 2020 in our hospital. The patients' demographics, neurological examinations, procedure and anaesthesia data, and postoperative follow-up were all evaluated. 15 of 19 patients were female. 2 mothers used folic acid supplementation, but it was not effective. 7 patients were diagnosed prenatally, whereas the others were not followed up during pregnancy. 9 of the patients had parenchyma inside the sac, while the rest had none. 5 patients required shunts. All of the patients were followed up by the departments of neurosurgery, pediatrics, pediatric neurology, neonatal, pediatric gastroenterology, and genetics for their needs. It was demonstrated that folic acid supplementation before conception greatly reduces the incidence of encephalocele. It would be appropriate to inform the families of babies diagnosed with encephalocele in detail at prenatal follow-up about what problems they can expect in the future. Follow-up of encephalocele patients must be done with a multidisciplinary approach to ensure a quality life throughout their life.

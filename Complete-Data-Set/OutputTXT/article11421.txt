Makale Başlığı: THE KNOWLEDGE STATUS OF MEDICAL INTERNS ON MENTAL STATUS REPORTS
Özet: Aim: This study aims to evaluate the knowledge levels of medical interns on mental status examination reports (MSER). Methods: This is a prospective cross-sectional study. This study included a total of 235 medical interns from the Gaziantep University School of Medicine between 21-25 October 2021. A questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics and the knowledge regarding mental status examination reports were performed to all participants. A total of 20 questions were scored on 20 points. Results: Of the students in this study, 124 (52.8%) were men and 111 (47.2%) were women. The mean age was 24.93±1.91 (min=23, max=39) years. Of the interns, 24 (10.2%) stated they had received training on preparing mental status examination reports and 164 (69.8%) told they willed to. Twentytwo (9.4%) of the participants reported that they felt confident in mental status examination reports while 213 (90.6%) stated they lacked competency. Sixtyfive (27.7%) of the interns told they were fear ful to prepare mental status examination reports and 164 (69.8%) expressed the misapprehension that there ports would be abused. The knowledge scores ranged between 3-19 with an average of 10.64±3.57 points. The mean knowledge score was 10.93±3.58 in men and 10.32±3.55 in women not displaying a statistically significant difference (p=0.192). The knowledge scores of interns with and without training on mental status examination reports were similar (p=0.086). The overall scores were significantly higher in interns who willed to have training on mental status examination reports and the ones who were apprehensive for an abuse (p<0.001 for both). Conclusion: We have detected some knowledge improprieties and deficiencies of the medical interns on MSER. This may have stemmed from the fact that they have not been adequately trained on this issue. That efficient training is provided on mental status examination reports and medical faculty curriculum are reorganized accordingly is of great importance.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Performance of Empirical Mode Decomposition on Noisy and Noiseless Signals in Automatic Detection of Hypertension with the Assistance of Electrocardiography
Özet: Hypertension (HPT) is the name given to the condition in which the force exerted by the blood carried from the heart to the body is high enough to cause some diseases. As a result of HPT-related diseases, many people die every year around the world. For this reason, early diagnosis of HPT is of critical importance. This study was conducted to detect HPT patients automatically and with minimum error by using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In this study, ECG signals were collected in 4 different groups. These approaches are respectively normalized noisy ECG signals, normalized noiseless ECG signals, unnormalized noisy ECG signals and finally unnormalized noiseless ECG signals. HPT determination performance was analyzed with the help of entropy measurements obtained from 5-layer internal mode function (IMF) signals by means of the Empirical Mode Decomposition method. Performances were compared with two features obtained for each IMF. In summary, the highest accuracy value of 99.99% was obtained with support vector machines (SVM) algorithms by using the 10-fold cross validation method. From the high performances obtained, it can be concluded that it will be useful to doctors in identifying people with HPT.

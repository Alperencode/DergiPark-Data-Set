Makale Başlığı: Performance of Heat Recovery Devices for Air Conditioning with 100% Fresh Air Analysis Depending on the Type of Climate
Özet: Today, the need for energy is increasing significantly in all countries. The efficient use of energy as well as its production has gained great importance. The efficient use of energy consumed in buildings has gained great importance with the tourism sector that has become industrial and the increase in people's comfort conditions. In this study, the selection of heat recovery devices for the multi-purpose hall of a hotel, considering the Covid19 epidemic, was examined by using 100% fresh air conditioning. According to the amount of useful heat recovery of rectangular plate cross flow (CHRV), hexagonal plate counter flow (KHRV), rotary drum sensible heat transfer (DHRV), rotary drum sensible and latent heat transfer (DERV) heat recovery devices used in air conditioning systems were analysed for the cooling season. As a result of the study, it was concluded that latent heat has a great effect on the selection of heat recovery devices for 100% fresh air conditioning, especially in pandemic conditions. It has been determined that the DERV device type, which can heat recover from latent heat, should be at the forefront, especially in cities with a climate type with high humidity.

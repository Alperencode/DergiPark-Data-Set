Makale Başlığı: Distribution of Role Models in Primary School Textbooks by Gender and Fields of Activity
Özet: Modeling is an important form of learning when the characters of the students are not yet fully formed by age. It is understood that taking a model has an important place in the development of behavior when it is considered that the student identifies with the people he/she chooses as role models. The role models in the textbooks contribute to the internalization of positive behaviors in the lessons where the student has the opportunity to identify with his life. The aim of this research is to determine the distribution of role models in Turkish, Life Studies, Social Studies, Mathematics and Science textbooks taught in primary schools according to gender and field of activity. In this direction, document analysis, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the research. Examined documents are 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade Turkish textbooks; 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade Life Studies textbooks; 4th grade Social Studies textbooks; 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades Mathematics textbooks; and 3rd and 4th grade Science textbooks. When the textbooks were examined, no role models were found in the mathematics textbooks. It has been determined that only 12 of these role models are women, in which 110 different role models are included in 10 textbooks. No one was found as a role model in any of the 4 books. As a field of activity, it has been determined that role models are included in the field of "science" most frequently in all courses, followed by the field of "military".

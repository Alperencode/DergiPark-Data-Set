Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Wall and Floor Tile Designs in the Turkish Ceramic Tile Industry from 1980 to the Present
Özet: After the First World War, radical changes were made in the field of economy with the effect of the Industrial Revolution. In the process after the industrial revolution, the concept of 'industrial ceramics' has developed and gained a new dimension. The increasing population growth in the 1950s led to the need for housing, thus demanding ceramic wall and floor tiles. Bozüyük Ceramic Factory was established in 1995 and Çanakkale Ceramic Factory was established in 1956 to meet the demands. In these years, in order to meet the requirements of tile, the imitation of the existing products abroad was studied. In the 1970s, minor changes were made in the patterns so that the designs were not exactly the same. In the 1980s, the competition among tile manufacturers in Turkey grew. Firms have turned to tile designs that make a difference and embarked on the path of branding. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they started to work with world-renowned designers and increased their product range. In recent years, companies have turned to design studies that will meet the demands and demands of customers in accordance with the developing technology. The ceramic industry, which is one of the leading sectors of our country with its sanctions on design, is one of the fields where our competitive power is the highest in the world market today.

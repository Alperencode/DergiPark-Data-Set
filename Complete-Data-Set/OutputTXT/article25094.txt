Makale Başlığı: Assessing Principals’ Quality Assurance Strategies in Osun State Secondary Schools, Nigeria
Özet: This paper examined principals’ quality assurance strategies in secondary schools  in Osun State, Nigeria. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design.  Stratified random sampling technique was used to select 10 male and 10 female  principals, and 190 male and190 female teachers. ‘Secondary School Principal  Quality Assurance Questionnaire’ (SSPQAQ) and ‘Students’ Academic  Performance Checklist’ (SAPC) were used to collect data for the study. The  instruments were validated, and test-retest method used to determine their  reliabilities yielded 0.74 and 0.71 respectively. One main hypothesis and five  operational hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. Descriptive and  inferential statistics were used for data analysis. The study further showed that  principals’ gender and school location had no significant impact on students’  academic performance. The implication of the findings is that ability of the  principals to put in place strategies that would ensure quality in the production of  school output is a critical factor in determining school effectiveness. It is against  this background that the paper concludes that quality assurance is a function for all  stakeholders within the school system. Because it is a management function, the  principal should coordinate teachers and other staff members to see that their  activities are geared towards ensuring quality in the schools. As part of quality  assurance strategies, the principal should recognize the philosophy of education in  all aspects of school activities

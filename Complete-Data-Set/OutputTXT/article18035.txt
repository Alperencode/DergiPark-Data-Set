Makale Başlığı: Metabolic status is not related to dietary acid load in polycystic ovary syndrome
Özet: Aim:Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at high risk for obesity-related disorders, insulin resistance (IR), and metabolic syndrome (MS). Adopting potent approaches to diet enhances cardiometabolic risk profile and reproductive function. Different types of diets have provided conflicting results so far. We aimed to investigate whether dietary acid load (DAL) contributed to the metabolic process in PCOS.Material and Method: This study included 46 newly diagnosed PCOS patients and 46 healthy individuals with matched age, sex, and BMI. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements were obtained. We extracted net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and potential renal acid load (PRAL) scores from 24-hour dietary data recorded on a nutrient database program for three days (BeBiS software program).Results:We concluded no statistically significant difference between the groups by NEAP (p=0.569) and PRAL (p=0.969).Patients with PCOS had higher fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR (p<0.001 and p<0.001 respectively.); however, fasting serum glucose and HbA1c levels were similar (p=0.077 and p=0.859, respectively). Both NEAP and PRAL presented positive correlations with waist circumference (WC) (r=.236, p=0.023 and r=.290, p=0.005), hip circumference (HC) (r=.229, p=0.028 and r=.241, p=0.021), respectively. PRAL negatively correlated with total testosterone(r=-.383, p<0.001), while NEAP did not (r=-0.135, p=0.218).Conclusion: We concluded that the PCOS patients and healthy controls had similar diets in acid load. Both NEAP and PRAL were associated with WC, HC. In addition, there was a positive correlation between PRAL and BMI and negative correlation with total testosterone. The results presented no significant association between DAL and IR.

Makale Başlığı: An evaluation of antroponims in Kazak hero tales
Özet: Tales, which have a very important place in the oral culture of a nation; traditions, customs, and customs of the nation to which they belong, in short, their perspectives on life are tools that carry them to the future within the scope of acceptance and rejection. The Kazakhs and their narratives, which continue the traces of the oral tradition in ancient geography, provide rich examples for the fairy tale genre. The tales called "ertegi" in Kazakh oral literature also shed light on the historical adventure of the Kazakh people. The "heroic tales", which are evaluated between extraordinary tales and heroic epics, are products of oral tradition with a more limited variety of topics, the main theme of which is based on the emphasis on "heroism". In Kazakh heroic tales, the marriage process of the hero or the struggle with the enemies or monsters is usually told within the scope of the subject. This study examined the names of the people in the Kazakh heroic tales. First of all, the names of men and women in the thirty-five heroic tales (İki Erkek Kardeş, Akbilek Kız-Turğın Bala, Akjan Batır,  Älibek Batır, Altın Aydar, Batır ile Bala, Bayğulan, Boz Atlı Boran Batır, Deldaş Batır, Duvdar Kız, Erkem Aydar, Hanşentay, Jartı Töstik, Yerden Çıkan Jelim Batır, Karaüyrek, Kerkula Atlı Kendebay, Kökjan Batır ile Ejderha, Kuyun Batır, Mamay Batırın Hayali, Nan Batır, Tumarbas Batır, Alaköz Batır, Ayualpaŋ, Suwdısalpaŋ, Tawdıtalpaŋ, Ayudäw / Ayıdev, Esekmergen, Jalğız Jigit Urpaḳtarı / Yalnız Yiğit’in Nesilleri, Jayıḳ Pen Edil / Yayık ile İdil, Jeztırnak, Ḳalabay Batır, Kara Batır, Ḳaradöŋ Batır, Mamay Batırdıŋ Armanı / Mamay Batırın Hayali, Talaspay Mergen) of Kazakh Turks classified under two main headings as “female” and “male” names; Then, under each main heading, subheadings were created within the framework of semantics and the identified person names were evaluated one by one.

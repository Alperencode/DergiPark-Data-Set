Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Gibberellic Acid (GA3) Treatments on Germination and Seedling Development of Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] Seeds at Different Salt Concentrations
Özet: This study was carried out in 2018 at Akdeniz University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Field Crops to examine the germination and seedling growth of gibberellic acid (GA3) treated sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] seeds at different salt concentrations. The experiment was conducted in Petri dishes in the germination cabinet according to the split-plots design with  3 replications. In the study, seeds were kept at 4 different GA3 doses (0, 100, 200, and 300 ppm) for 24 hours and then germinated at 5 different salt doses (0, 2500, 5000, 7500, and 10000 ppm NaCl). In the study, germination rate, shoot length, root length, shoot and root fresh weights and shoot and root dry weights were investigated. At the end of the study, it was determined that all traits except germination rate were significantly (p<0.01) affected by salt stress, and the effect of GA3 application on all traits except root dry weight was insignificant. In the study, the germination rate of sorghum seeds varied between 69.33% and 89.33%. According to the results of the study, shoot length was measured between 4.64 cm (10000 ppm NaCl) and 9.79 cm (control), root length was measured between 3.13 cm (10000 ppm NaCl) and 6.05 cm (control), shoot fresh weight was determined between 18.96 mg plant-1 (10000 ppm NaCl) and 49.49 mg plant-1 (control); root fresh weight was determined between 5.43 mg plant-1 (10000 ppm NaCl) and 15.15 mg plant-1, shoot dry weight was varied between 2.32 mg plant-1 (10000 ppm NaCl) and 4.67 mg plant-1 (control); and root dry weight varied between 0.58 mg plant-1 (10000 ppm NaCl) and 0.99 mg plant-1 (control). Apart from the germination ratio, other properties were negatively affected by the increase in salt concentration. The GA3 applications evaluated in the study, on the other hand, did not have an effect on mitigating these negative effects of salt stress. As a result, it is seen that more comprehensive studies are needed to obtain more precise results about the effects of GA3 application on sorghum seeds germinated in saline conditions.

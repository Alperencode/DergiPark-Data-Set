Makale Başlığı: Reflecting the Phenomenon of Alafrangalik in the Context of Westernization Ideology to the Family Institution in Turkish Theater
Özet: The Ottoman Empire, which took the West as a model, started with The Royal Declaration of Gülhane and the process of Westernization was entered. Along with this process, radical changes began to occur in all areas from politics to art, from etiquette to family relations. The uneventful acceptance of the West in daily life has also found its reflection in the field of theatre. One of the most important subjects and themes that find their reflection on the stage is Family. The family, which is excluded under the influence of sacred beliefs in traditional theater, has also settled in the center of Turkish Theater, which developed with the ideology of Westernization, due to its universality and its convenience in creating dramatic situations. The change that came with Westernization has affected the family institution in different ways, one of the most interesting of this effect is the passion of “Alafrangalık”.

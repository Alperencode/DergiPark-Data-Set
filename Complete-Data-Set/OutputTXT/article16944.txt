Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Sportsmanship Behavior and Communication Skills: A Study on University Student-Athletes
Özet: The concept of sportsmanship, frequently mentioned from the ancient Olympics to today's modern Olympics, is increasing its popularity day by day. This study aims to examine the sportsmanship behavior of undergraduate university students and determine its relationship with communication skills. Accordingly, 415 university students reached online with convenience sampling, one of the non-random sampling methods, constituted the study sample. As data collection tools, the “Sportsmanship Scale” developed by Gümüş et al. (2020), and the “Communication Skills Scale” developed by Korkut-Owen and Bugay (2014), were used. Kurtosis and skewness values were examined to assess the conformity of the obtained data to normal distribution. Data analysis included descriptive statistics determining students' demographic characteristics, t-test, and ANOVA. Correlation Analysis tests were applied to reveal the relationship between the two scales, and a p-value of 0.05 was considered the significance level for all analyzes. The analyzes showed that the total communication skills scores and the scores from the sub-dimensions of active listening, non-verbal communication, and willingness to communicate of women were statistically significantly higher than the scores of men. While the sportsmanship behaviors of the students did not differ based on gender, there was a moderate positive relationship between the communication skills scale and all sub-dimensions of the sportsmanship scale.

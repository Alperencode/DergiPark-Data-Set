Makale Başlığı: PREPARATION AND IN VITRO CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID LIPID MICROPARTICLES FOR PROTEIN DELIVERY
Özet: Objective: The aim of this research was to assess the effect of the process and formulation parameters during the preparation of solid lipid microparticles. Solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) have evident advantages such as biocompatibility, simplicity of production and characterization, prolonged release, and especially high protein loading capacity, despite being less investigated than lipid nanoparticles.Material and Method: SLMs were prepared via emulsion solvent diffusion technique using glyceryl tridecanoate (GTD) as a biocompatible and biodegradable lipid. The optimum formulation conditions for producing homogenous spherical microparticles were found and represented by a triangle phase diagram area. After optimizing the particle size and encapsulation efficiency by changing the formulation parameters, the microparticles were characterized by in vitro release, morphological analysis, thermal analysis and electrophoretic analysis on the selected formulations.Result and Discussion: The maximum drug loading efficiency was achieved by combining 100 mg of lipid, 60% triacetin and 3% emulsifier. The average microparticle size was observed as 8.9 μm. The in vitro drug release were analyzed in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and were mainly completed at 8th hour.

Makale Başlığı: Designing Generalized Cylinder with Characteristic Base Curve in Euclidean 3-space
Özet: Designing a surface from a given curve  under some special conditions is an important  problem in many practical applications. The purpose of this article is to design a generalized cylinder whose base curve is a characteristic   curve   in Euclidean 3- space.  The main results  show that the generalized cylinder with geodesic, line of curvature, or asymptotic base curve is a rectifying  cylinder,  a right cylinder, or a plane  respectively.

Özet: Although it is desired to be integrated into education quickly with the advancement of technology, it takes time to embed such changes in education. Teachers and teacher candidates are expected to have sufficient readiness and technological infrastructure in order to keep up with the targeted and rapid transformations. The study aims to determine the views of elementary mathematics teacher candidates (EMTC) on the use of digital technology (DT) in mathematics education. A case study, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the research. The data of the study conducted with 83 elementary mathematics teacher candidates were collected within the framework of nine open-ended questions. In line with the analyses carried out, it was concluded that undergraduate courses positively affect the use of digital technologies in mathematics education. It has been stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has opened the door to the use of digital technologies in mathematics education, and opinions on what digital technologies can be used in mathematics education have been put forward. Suggestions were made that teacher candidates should increase the courses on the use of digital technologies in their undergraduate education.

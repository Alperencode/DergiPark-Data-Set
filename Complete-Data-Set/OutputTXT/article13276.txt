Makale Başlığı: The relationship between immigrant students integration to education and teaching turkish as a foreign language
Özet: In this study, teaching Turkish as a second and mother tongue for immigrants was evaluated sociolinguistically. The cultural dimension, gender dimension and language education dimension of sociolinguistics, which appeals to a very wide area, are discussed by presenting examples from studies applied in the context of Turkish in different countries. Considering that every subject related to language concerns people and society, it can be said that language use, development and teaching of language are closely related to sociolinguistics. After the intense migration to Turkey between 2010 and 2013, a wide range of projects were carried out with the support of the Ministry of National Education, the General Directorate of Lifelong Learning, universities and various non-governmental organizations to teach Turkish to the children of immigrant families and ensure their integration into the Turkish school system. In this study, which includes studies on teaching Turkish to both immigrants abroad and immigrants living in Turkey, Turkey's international position in the education integration of immigrants and the development of Western European countries, where Turks are concentrated, according to MIPEX data, are discussed by comparing them with previous years. MIPEX data obtained in 2014 and 2019 has been published under 8 different titles. However, in this study, MIPEX data were only examined in terms of the performance of countries in ensuring immigrant integration in education. In this study, studies on teaching Turkish for foreigners in Turkey and language education in Western European countries where Turks are concentrated are indicated.

Makale Başlığı: Impact of Economic Growth on Environmental Degradation  and Energy Consumption in South Africa: A Cointegration Analysis
Özet: The present research focuses on the impact of economic growth on environmental degradation  and energy usage by including the role of urbanization in South Africa between 1971 and 2015. By employing the Johansen and Bounds test cointegration approaches for this research, we revealed a long-run linkage among the variables. Also, according to the results of the study the ARDL exposes that (i) energy use and urbanization exert a positive effect on environmental degradation ; (ii) environmental degradation  impacts economic growth positively; (iii) economic growth and environmental degradation  exert a positive impact on energy usage; and finally (iv) urbanization exerts a negative influence on energy use in South Africa. The outcomes of both FMOLS and DOLS support the findings of the ARDL. In addition, the outcomes of the Granger causality test showed that a one-way causal relationship from all the regressors to economic growth in the long run. Besides, there is a unidirectional causal relationship running from economic growth to energy use and urbanization in the short run.

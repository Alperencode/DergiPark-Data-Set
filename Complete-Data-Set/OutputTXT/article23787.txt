Makale Başlığı: The Reasons Pushing a Child to Crime in the Context of Child Delinquency
Özet: Child and crime are two concepts that must not be together. Unfortunately, the family in which the child grows up, child's close circle, social, cultural and economic state and social problems of the society cause the child to commit a criminal act. The continuation of the negative effects of the child's individual characteristics and other external factors surrounding the child, absence of the support system with failure of the function of the family, leads to crime once again. Being dragged into crime leaves deep traces in the growing and individual life of a child. In adolescence, the child's acquaintance with crime and taking place in the judicial system; can cause the child to get away from the school, lose communication with his peers, have problems in the work environment, and deteriorate his psychological health. People who developed criminal behavior in their childhood have a high risk of delinquency when they become adults. Knowing the causes of criminal behavior in childhood is very important in terms of both taking preventive measures and developing protective and remedial interventions. Child Protection Law No: 5385 is based on the protection of the child rather than a punishment and measures have been taken to protect the child in all processes, starting with the child's entry into the judicial system.

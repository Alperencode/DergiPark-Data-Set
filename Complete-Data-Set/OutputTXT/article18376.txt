Makale Başlığı: “SANTA CLAUS IS NOT A MAN”: AN EVALUATION ON NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS IN TURKEY
Özet: When Turkey began to approach every year on December 31, Christmas celebrations are located at the beginning of the debate. While one side stands against the New Year's celebrations for religious and cultural reasons; the other side argued that the celebrations had no religious dimension and that it was nothing more than simple entertainment. However, while making these discussions, the reasons arising from economic relations are overlooked. This study while trying to deal with the course of New Year's celebrations in Turkey in history, it will be tried to establish a connection with economic relations as well as cultural, political and religious reasons. In this context, it is thought that the Christmas Market, which was held between 20-29 December 2019, is clearly separated from the religious and cultural debates in the New Year's Eve celebrations in Turkey. In this direction, in a time when Turkey is becoming increasingly conservative, it will be discussed where to put the Christmas Market, which contains and openly expresses Western cultural values.

Makale Başlığı: A NEW METHOD IN PENAL PROCEDURE CODE THAT COMMITMENT TO GIVE A STATEMENT
Özet: In this study, the institution of the commitment to give a statement, which was added to the article 94 of the Criminal Procedure Law No. 5271 with the amendment dated 08.07.2021 as the 3rd paragraph and which has unsolved question marks on practice, will be discussed. The subject of the study; focuses on the institution that regulates the release of individuals for whom an arrest warrant has been issued to release them after giving their statement, instead of being taken into custody after their apprehension outside of working hours, by the order of the Public Prosecutor, who is informed of the arrest, with the commitment that they will apply to the courthouse with their consent to give their statements at a specified future date. Quite succintly, the regulation, which includes the arrest of individuals with the arrest warrant for getting their statements, their release with the commitment, and the punishment of an administrative fine of 1000 TL in case of violation of the commitment, is a completely new institution due to the absence of a similar institution before and the ambiguity it brings is obvious. In the study, different possibilities regarding the aforementioned institution will be discussed and the subject will be tried to be concretized through the case studies encountered in the practice of the commitment to give statement, which is still very new. In this way, while applying the institution of commitment to give statement, which was created with the aim of prioritizing individual freedoms, will be focused on the ideas that are deemed necessary in order not to interrupt the judicial process.

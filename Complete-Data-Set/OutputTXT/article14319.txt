Makale Başlığı: AN EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPORTS COMMITMENT AND LIFE SATISFACTION AMONG ATHLETES INTERESTED IN WINTER SPORTS
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the comparative relationships between the level of commitment to sports and life satisfaction of athletes who do winter sports according to various variables. A relational scanning model is used to solve the problem. The sample group of the study consists of 255 athletes over the age of 18 who have been interested in winter sports for at least 3 years. Questionnaires were made face-to-face at Erzurum Palandöken Ski Facilities, Erzurum Palandöken Ice Skating Hall, Erzurum Ice Hockey Halls, and Erzurum Yakutiye Curling Hall, for athletes interested in winter sports. While the "Sport Attachment Scale" (Sırgancı, Araç, and Cihan) was used to collect data on sports commitment, the "Life Satisfaction Scale'' (Dal and Baysal) was used to collect data on life satisfaction. The SPSS statistical program was used to evaluate the data. As a conclusion, while the sports commitment levels of the athletes participating in the competitions on behalf of the national team were found to be significantly higher, it was determined that the sled athletes had a higher sports commitment score than the other athletes. In addition, it was founded that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the total score of the life satisfaction scale and the total score of commitment to sports.

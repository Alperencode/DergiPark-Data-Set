Makale Başlığı: Ambiguous Boundaries: Mother-Daughter Bond From The Perspective Of Adult Daughter
Özet: This article is based on a qualitative research that seeks an answer to the question of how the bond of adult daughters with their mothers within the patriarchal institution and practices of motherhood affects and shapes their gendering processes and personalities. Within the scope of the research, both e-interviews and face-to-face interviews are conducted with eight women whose mothers are alive. The findings on the bond between mother and adult daughters are analysed and interpreted using the feminist object relation theory, which focuses on self-development and, the patriarchal gendering process. The relationship established with the mother is examined in terms of the gendering process and internalized gender roles, and the role of mothers at different stages of their daughters' lives, in terms of the effect of the girls on their relationships with other people. In general, it is possible to categorize the participants as adult daughters who have conflicting and/or consensual relationships with their mothers. In conflictual relationships, where separation from the mother and independence come to the fore as a problem, the daughters try to cope with the relationships that negatively affect them by not objecting to their ties with their mothers, by trying to stay away from the bond or by trying to change the bond. In relatively consensual relationships, mother and adult daughter can establish relationships where there is less interference and where the parties recognize each other's relatively independent existence. Masculine values and social relations that glorify separation and individuation for self-development do not allow for a solidaristic relationship between mothers and daughters that recognizes each other's existence by confining different forms of association, such as commitment and reciprocity, to dependency.

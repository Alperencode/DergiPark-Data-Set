Makale Başlığı: A Weapon That Shaped the History of War: Turkish Composite Bow and Complementary Elements
Özet: Bows are classified into two groups: basic and composite. However, these groups may also be sub-grouped in different types. The most important feature that distinguished composite bows from basic bows was that different materials other than wood were also used for the production of composite bows. Turkish bows analysed under this article are of a composite type. Thanks to the different materials used at the stage of production, these bows were more durable and it was possible to use them for many years without any deformation just like the first day. One could say that these bows are inherited from father to son because of this feature. A Turkish composite bow is strung reflexively. In other words, the bow was strung contrary to the fixed direction. This reflexivity made the bow stronger and so it was possible to shoot the arrows to a long distance.  It was troublesome to make arrows serving as a bullet for a bow. This was because an arrow that was not made properly would not be fast enough and properly guided. An arrow is divided into more than one part with the arrowhead being the most important one. An arrowhead is divided by the material used for the production and, also there are different typologies. Thumb rings and quivers, the auxiliary tools to use a bow, were essential for archery. A thumb ring was used to prevent the bowstring from damaging the right thumb and, a quiver was auxiliary equipment made of organic materials to hold the arrows.

Makale Başlığı: Quantitative Analysis of Bioactive Compounds by High‑Performance Liquid Chromatography in Origanum bilgeri
Özet: Origanum genus is an aromatic and medicinal plant with significant bioactive compounds. Origanum species have been used as a folk medicine for years. In this study, the aerial part of Origanum bilgeri P.H. Davis was extracted with hexane and methanol successively, the methanol extract was used for quantitative analysis of bioactive compounds by High‑Performance Liquid Chromatography. Rosmarinic acid was found as a major product (26.61 mg/g extract). The other major compounds were detected as catechin hydride (5.65 mg/g extract), trans-cinnamic acid (2.65 mg/g extract), and resveratrol (1.33 mg/g extract). Consequently, Origanum bilgeri may be a valuable material for drug development and food.

Makale Başlığı: Ten Year Hepatitis A, B, And C Seroprevalence Trend in Children: Results From A Single Center
Özet: Aim: Hepatitis B vaccination since 1998 and hepatitis A vaccination since 2012 is available in the childhood routine vaccination program in Turkey. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C yet. The seroprevalence of hepatitis A, B, and C differs between regions. For this reason, each region should assemble its own rates. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis A, B, and C in children in Kastamonu province, to evaluate whether there is a change in prevalence according to years and patient age, and to review whether there is a change in hepatitis A virus seroprevalence with hepatitis A vaccination.Material and Methods: File records of all patients under 18 whose hepatitis serology was studied at Kastamonu Training and Research Hospital between 01.01.2012 and 21.12.2021 were reviewed retrospectively.Results: A total of 19885 patients and 55738 test results were included in the study. Accordingly, hepatitis A seroprevalence increased year by year. Anti-HAV IgG positivity was higher in the vaccinated group, whereas anti-HAV IgM positivity was higher in the unvaccinated group (p<0.01). Anti-HBs gradually decreased until the age of 13 and increased again thereafter. Anti-HCV was positive in 11 patients (0.1%).Conclusions: Our study shows successful results of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination. Therefore, we recommend that the extended immunization program carried out in Turkey be continued meticulously, and prevention methods should always be applied for hepatitis C.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest hunger rate (as a percentage of the population). In this region; One in four people is malnourished. As a result of malnutrition, one in five children born each year dies. In developing countries, one in six children dies from hunger. A quarter of the world's children do not show enough physical development. In developing countries, this rate rises to one third. Of the 66 million primary school-aged children each year, 23 million attend the hunger class between Africa and developing countries alone.

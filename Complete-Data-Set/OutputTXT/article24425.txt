Makale Başlığı: Abundance and Diversity of Winter Larval-fish Assemblages off Yumurtalık (Iskenderun Bay)
Özet: Here, abundance, diversity andcomposition of ichthyoplankton assemblages of İskenderun Bay was investigatedin winter period together with environmental conditions. For this purpose, a totalof 6 cruise works was performed between 7/12/2015 and 1/3/2016 at the sixstations located at 10, 30 and 60m depth contours off Yumurtalık, İskenderunBay. Samples were collected by using oblique tows of Bongo-60 net. During thestudy, eggs and larvae of 67 species were collected. Median of observedrichness was 6 species per station and of abundance was 36 individual/10m2.Median of Shannon-Wiener diversity index and its evenness component Pielouevenness index were 1.86 and 0.98 respectively. Bregmaceros nectabanus, Sparusaurata, Etrumeus golanii, Gobius paganellus and Sardina pilchardus were dominantspecies. Total abundance, richness and diversity of ichthyoplankton assemblageswere significantly lower at 10m depth contour. Within winter season, temporalchanges of ichthyoplankton composition were found to be significant. Amongstthe environmental conditions measured, only temperature was significantlycorrelated with the species composition.

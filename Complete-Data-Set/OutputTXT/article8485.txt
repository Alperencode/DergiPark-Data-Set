Makale Başlığı: The Growth Impact of Human Development: A Developed- and Developing-Country Comparison
Özet: Although development is a multi-directional economic variable, its most important aspect is growth: the increase in production and per capita income. It also is marks the economic, cultural, social, and political progress of societies. Although variables such as poverty, income distribution, employment, and the ability to meet basic needs are now more focused issues, this concept has become an important development issue not only from a single economic  point  of  view,  but  also  with  its  human  dimensions. Man is at the center of development; thus,  the  human  development  index  obtained  by  combining indicators such as education, health, and income levels are among the most important factors of human life. This is also an important measurement tool for measuring individual quality of life. This study compared two groups of countries by determining the relationship of the human development index of developed and developing countries with growth through  panel  regression  analysis.  According  to  the analysis, when the human development index increases by 1 unit for developed countries, growth ncreases by 38.7%. For developing countries, when the human development index increases by 1 unit, growth increases by 17.4%. Thus, the contribution of  human  development  to  growth  is  higher  in  developed  countries  than  developing  countries.  Therefore, it is important that developing countries implement  policies  quickly  to  increase  human  development.

Makale Başlığı: Examination of The 6th-grade music curricula in Kosovo and Turkey
Özet: Education in the Turkish language in Kosovo, which has historically passed through various stages, enables Turkish society to preserve its cultural elements. In addition, relations in education between this young country, which has a rich shared history, and the Republic of Turkey, are developing daily with protocols to support education in Turkish. In Kosovo, education in the Turkish language is essential for both Kosovo's education system and the Turkish World. Since Kosovo is a young country, there are problems with education, such as teachers, books and materials. These problems are among music education issues as in all other courses. The current situation should be revealed through comparative studies to find solutions to these problems. For this reason, this research aims to examine the 6th-grade music education programs of Kosovo and Turkey in terms of aims and achievements and to examine their similarities and differences. During the six months spent in Kosovo, on-site investigations were made, and data were collected for the research. The data collected through document analysis from Kosovo and Turkey were analyzed by the descriptive method by forming themes. As a result of the study, the similarities and differences in the areas of objectives and achievements in the 6th-grade music lesson curriculum of Kosovo and Turkey were evaluated. In addition, it has been determined that there are deficiencies in the Kosovo 6th grade music curriculum regarding achievements. In the Kosovo 6th grade music curriculum, the "recommended listening" data should be added to the repertoire and Türkiye music curriculum.

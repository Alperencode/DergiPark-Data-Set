Makale Başlığı: Pediatric Open Globe Injury in a University-Based Tertiary Hospital in the Anatolian Region
Özet: Objective: Evaluation of the epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric open globe injury. Methods: Medical records of 51 patients under the age of 18 who presented to the emergency department with open globe injury (OGI) between 2009 and 2021 were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT) category, pediatric ocular trauma score (POTS), visual acuity (VA), site of injury, and seasonal distribution were evaluated. Results: Of all patients included, 40 (78.4%) were male, 11 (21.6%) were female, and the mean age was 9.6±5.2 years. Zone I injury was detected in 31 (60.8%) patients. The most common cause of injury was sharp objects such as metal or wood splinters. Of all injuries, 29 (56.9%) occurred outdoors. Ocular trauma occurred more frequently in boys, especially in the summer months. Initial VA was less than 0,1 in 21 (41.2%) of the patients, between 0.1-0.5 in 9 (17.6%) and 0.6 and above in 5 (9.8%) patients. At the final visit, VA was less than 0.1 in 9 (17.6%) patients, 0.1-0.5 in 10 (19.6%) patients, and 0.6 and above in 18 (35.3%) patients. Final VA was related to the Zone and was lower as the Zone increased (p:0.011). VA and POTS scores were positively correlated at the final visit (p=0.001). Conclusion: It is substantial for emergency physicians to have a comprehensive understanding of pediatric globe injuries so that children with suspected ocular trauma should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist to prevent medicolegal problems.

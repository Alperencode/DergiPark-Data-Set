Makale Başlığı: The impact of text preprocessing on the prediction of review ratings
Özet: With the increase of e-commerce platforms and online applications, businessmen are looking to have a rating  and review system through which they can easily reveal the feelings of customers related to their products and services. It  is undeniable from the statistics that online ratings and reviews attract new customers as well as increase sales by means  of providing confidence, ratification, opinions, comparisons, merchant credibility, etc. Although considerable research  has been devoted to the sentiment analysis for review classification, rather less attention has been paid to the text  preprocessing which is a crucial step in opinion mining especially if convenient preprocessing strategies are found out to  increase the classification accuracy. In this paper, we concentrate on the impact of simple text preprocessing decisions in  order to predict fine-grained review rating stars whereas the majority of previous work focused on the binary distinction  of positive vs. negative. Therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze preprocessing techniques and their influence,  at the same time explain the interesting observations and results on the performance of a five-class-based review rating  classifier.

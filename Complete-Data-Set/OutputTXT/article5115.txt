Makale Başlığı: Investigating the Rooting Status of Some Wild (Delice) Olive (Olea europaea L. subps. oleaster) Genotypes in Hatay Province's Hassa District
Özet: This study was designed to investigate the rooting performance of some wild olive (Delice) genotypes obtained through selection. Therefore, we investigated 133 different genotypes selected from the wild olive populations, whose material came from the Hassa of Hatay province between November 2020 and March 2022, were used as material. This research was carried out at the Hatay Olive Research Institute Hassa Station Operation. Perlite was used as a rooting material in the study. Besides that, the 3 cm bottom parts of the cuttings prepared with an average size of 25 cm were immersed in an indole butyric acid (IBA) solution prepared at a dose of 4000 ppm for 5 seconds. The plantings were performed in a semi-automatic greenhouse with a fogging system and bottom heating set at 25oC. In this way, cuttings belonging to genotypes that completed 90 days were removed and rooting rate, root number and root length were determined. As a result of the study, in the light of all the data, 5 wild olive genotypes were identified as rootstock candidates with high rootstock potential, which are genotype no: 31.8.2.39 with 917 points, genotype no: 31.8.16.11 with 860 points, genotype no: 31.8.2.36 with 798 points, genotype no: 31.8.2.34 with 797 points, and genotype no: 31.8.16.16 with 772 points, respectfully.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF LEARNING WRITING ON PRIMARY STUDENTS' ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND ATTITUDES TOWRITING
Özet: This study, it was aimed to determine the effects of learning-oriented writing practices on primary school fourth grade students' attitudes towards writing and their academic achievement in the "Matter and Change" unit. Semi-experimental design was used in the research. Four branches were taken at the fourth grade level of primary education, and two of these branches were randomly assigned to form the experimental group and the other two to form the control group. The research was carried out with a total of 105 students, 52 in the experimental groups and 53 in the control groups. The attitude scale towards writing (YYTÖ) and the Item and Change academic achievement test (MDABT) were given to the experimental and control groups as pre-tests. Within the scope of the Science course, a 7-week practice was carried out with writing activities for learning purposes in the teaching of the "Matter and Change Unit". While letters were written to the students in the experimental group, the students in the control group were given a summary. After the application, YYTÖ and MDABT were applied to the experimental and control groups as a post-test. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program. In addition, by making use of the results obtained in this research, suggestions for field articles for future studies are presented.

Makale Başlığı: A Hybrid Algorithm for Automated Guided Vehicle Routing Problem
Özet: Nowadays, automatic systems become crucial in many factories to achievesome tasks such as minimizing cost, maximizing efficiency, quality, andreliability. The planning is important for manufacturing systems to adoptchanging conditions. Also, manufacturers want to obtain fast, reliable,qualified and economic products. Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) are usedto meet this need. FMSs make production fast, qualified, reliable and economicby using computer-controlled structure that includes robots and transportationsystems. Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and FMS are thought to be integratedbecause FMSs use AGVs as a part of transportation in the factory. AGVs are usedto carry loads, in other words products, in production areas, warehouses,factories that use magnets, landmarks, laser sensors, lines to know where theyare. AGV scheduling and routing is NP-hard and open-ended problems. In theliterature, there are many algorithms and methods are proposed to solve theseproblems. In this study, we present a hybrid algorithm that is composed ofsimulated annealing (SA) and Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve the routing problem.The hybrid algorithm is compared with SA algorithm in terms of distance costusing benchmark problems in the literature.

Makale Başlığı: Kitap Tanıtımı: Bill Emmott, The Fate of the West: The Battle to Save the World's Most Successful Political Idea, London: The Economist Books, 2018
Özet: Some political books become out of date quickly in a climate of ever-changing world events and technological and scientific transformations. The impact of Covid-19 across the globe and Russia's invasion of Ukraine fills our television screens, collective consciousness, and lives. So, the former editor-in-chief of The Economist (between 1993 and 2006), Bill Emmott's The Fate of the West: The Battle to Save the World's Most Successful Political Idea, written in 2018, will inevitably have limitations in terms of its content and up-to-dateness. Nevertheless, the author's core argument about the urgent need to rejuvenate neoliberal democracies is topical and important.

Makale Başlığı: Management of Fishing Ports on the Financial Performance of the Türkiye Fishery Sector; A Case of Fishing Ports in Hatay Province
Özet: In this study, a comparative economic analysis was made on how financial performance can be measured and analyzed in four fishing port (Çevlik, Konacık, İskenderun and Dörtyol) in Hatay, Turkey. In order to measure the financial performance, the data were obtained from the database of the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry and the Property Directorate, through one-to-one interviews with the operators of the fishing ports in 2017. At the end of the study, it has been determined that there are differences between the legal regulations and regulations related to the practical activities of the fishing port enterprises. In these differences, it can be clearly said that the operation of the fishing ports by the fishery cooperatives in the region does not provide the expected benefit from the fishing ports. The results showed that Dörtyol fishing port was to be the best fishing port in terms of financial performance, location and diversity of boats using the port.

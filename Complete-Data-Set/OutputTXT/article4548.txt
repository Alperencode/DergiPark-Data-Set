Makale Başlığı: Life Experiences of Children a Parent with a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder
Özet: A diagnosis of a mental disorder in the parent may lead to very troubling life experiences both for the child and the parent.  Children of parents followed up for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder struggle with many individual and social difficulties. While each child's life experience is unique and special, there are seen that dramatic similarities between them. These children have feelings of fear, embarrassment, sadness, hopelessness; encounter various social problems characterized by interpersonal inconsistency, aggression, behavioral disorder, and low self-esteem; being exposed to stigma and are overwhelmed with heavy responsibilities at an early age. Their coping strategies can be maladaptive, such as smoking or alcohol consumption, thinking of eloping, becoming introverted, and so on. Despite these negative effects, positive effects such as the development of problem-solving skills and increased self-confidence can be seen in some children. In this study, it was aimed to discuss the role of nurses by examining the life experiences and needs of the children of parents with schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. It is thought that obtaining knowledge about the life experiences of these children can help guide nursing interventions in order to increase family functionality, meet the requirements and improve the coping skills.

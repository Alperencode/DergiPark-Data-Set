Makale Başlığı: ALAİN BADİOU: PURSUİT OF THE TRUTH İN TWİLİGHT
Özet: According to Alain Badiou, expressions such as not leaving the usual, not intending to philosophical desire, not resisting language games, not rebelling against fake lives, not giving up on "masochistic obedience", being afraid of encountering reality, not taking risks, “the passion of ignorance” mask the truth. These masks have almost glued to our age while the passion for reality has been replaced by the passion for postmodern imitation, cynicism, fanaticism, exploitation and oppression have become dominant. In this case, while the expression of truth “own your desire” has disappeared, the slogan of capitalism “you exist to the extent that you consume” has begun to be adopted. Radical conservatism and political hidden exploitations have been replaced by the bare exploitation of capitalism. In this huge environment of exploitation and crisis, the pursuit of real life and the truth is more difficult than ever, since these pursuits require resistance to capitalism in terms of activist, actionist ways. There are problems such as how resistance will arise based on an uncertain event and who is the activist subject who will reveal it.Our aim in this article to analyse how Badiou explains the crisis situation or the wreckage of capitalism and how he forms its framework, then try to state how he created his desire for truth against this crisis and finally make a discussion about these problems.

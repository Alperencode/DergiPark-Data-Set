Makale Başlığı: The recent capture of Bregmaceros nectabanus(Bregmacerotidae) from purse-seine fishery in Izmir Bay, NE Aegean Sea
Özet: On 25 March 2022, two specimens of Bregmaceros nectabanus were captured by a commercial purse-seiner for targeting sardine and anchovy off Kırdeniz, Izmir Bay at a depth of 30 m. The total length of these specimens was between 53 and 63 mm. Thus, the record number has reached at least 37 specimens in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. This paper presents the third confirmed record of B. nectabanus from Izmir Bay (Northeastern Aegean Sea). Though the sporadic occurrences of this species in Izmir Bay do not indicate an established population for the time being, it signs that it's getting abundant.

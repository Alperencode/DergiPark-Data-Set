Makale Başlığı: Committing the Offense of Intentional Injury with “Any Instrument, Not Having Been Specifically Manufactured for the Purpose of Attack or Defense, Which May Be Used for Such Purpose” and is Accepted as a Weapon
Özet: The  commission  of  the  offense  of  intentional  injury  with  a  weapon  is  included  as  a  secondary  element  requiring  the  aggravation  of  the  penalty  in  subparagraph  (e)  of  paragraph  3  of  Article  86  of  the  Turkish  Penal  Code  numbered  5237 (TCK). According to the 4th subparagraph of paragraph (f ) of Article 6 of the TCK, “in the implementation of the criminal law,” it is stated that “[a]ny instrument, not having been specifically manufactured for the purpose of attack or [defense], which may be used for such purpose” will be understood as a weapon. However, it is not clear what should be understood from the aforementioned expression in subparagraph 4. In this study, the problems caused by the phrase “[a]ny instrument, not having been specifically manufactured for the purpose of attack or defense, which may be used for  such  purpose”  will  be  examined  in  practice.  Subsequently,  the  necessity  of  abolishing  the  4th  subparagraph  and  using another expression with an amendment to be made in article 6 or the subparagraph (e) of the 3rd paragraph of article 86 of the TCK will be emphasized.

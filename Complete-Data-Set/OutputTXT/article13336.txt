Makale Başlığı: Translation adventure of French crime novel in Turkey
Özet: The inclusion of crime novel, which have only lately been acknowledged as a literary genre in the history of world literature, in academic studies dates back to recent history. It is thought that it is challenging to give the crime novel a precise definition, as it has many sub-genres and different forms of creation, which is defined as the novel that chooses its subject from the events falling under the jurisdiction of the police in the Dictionary of the Turkish Language Institution. It is necessary to evaluate this book genre, which emerged in the 19th century, in the historical and cultural conditions of that period. This genre, which is regarded to be the main factor of industrial cities, was initially written in the style of a classic book but subsequently evolved into a distinct category with set guidelines. It took the 1960s for crime novel to be adopted as a competent genre by literary critics. In this study, it is explained how the crime novel genre, which has recently attracted the attention of critics, emerged, how it spread all over the world, and how French crime novels in Turkey, in particular, had an impact on crime novels in Turkey through translation. Additionally, the introduction of this genre into our literary system through translation in the Tanzimat Period as well as its development process are included.

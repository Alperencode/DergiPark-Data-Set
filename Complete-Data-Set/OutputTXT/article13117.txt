Makale Başlığı: Compensation of Springback for High Strength Steels by Thickness Reduction Method
Özet: The sheet metal bending process plays an important role in sheet metal production and springback is an unintended consequence of this operation. If the bending die process is performed without knowing the amount of springback, it is difficult to produce parts within acceptable tolerance values. The springback behavior of the part to be bent also affects the size of the bending die. In particular, in the case of a 90° U bend die, the manufacturing cost of the bending die with the springback compensation method is high. Therefore, it is important to estimate the springback value at the design stage. In this work, the estimation of the amount of deformation to avoid springback value was performed using the thickness reduction method for high strength sheet metal. According to this study, the thickness reduction method can be used effectively in springback compensation. The estimation of the measurement accuracy at the design stage reduces the cost of the bending die and it is possible to produce parts within tolerance limits without much experimentation. The results showed that thickness reduction at the 0,2 t value was suitable to eliminate the springback value in the U-bending process. It has been found that experimental, empirical and finite element results are close to each other.

Following the aim, the research uses a questionnaire that is one of the quantitative methods The population of the study consists of ethnic restaurant customers living in Turkey, and the sample of the study consists of 393 consumers who were determined by convenience sampling method and had at least one experience of eating in an ethnic restaurant. In the analysis of the data, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to determine the consistency and reliability of the measurement variables. Afterwards, the adequacy of the research model and the validity of the hypotheses were tested with structural equation modeling (SEM). As a result, it has been determined that the hedonic value variable has a statistically significant and positive effect on consumer satisfaction and behavioral intention in ethnic restaurants. While the utilitarian value variable has an effect on consumer satisfaction, it has been determined that it has no significant effect on behavioral intention and has less effect than hedonic value. At the same time, it draws attention as another result that consumer satisfaction acts as a bridge between hedonic and utilitarian value and behavioral intentions and has a positive effect on behavioral intentions.

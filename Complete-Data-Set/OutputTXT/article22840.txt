Makale Başlığı: Time Front of the Screen: The McDonaldization of Television Viewing - Binge-Watching
Özet: Unlike with traditional cable or satellite television, it is possible to reach OTT (over-the-top) platforms, which offer the audience to watch “anytime, anywhere, any device” from any device connected to the internet. Subscribers of OTT platforms (Netflix, Blutv, PuhuTv etc.) can easily access the content they want, such as series, movies, documentaries and watch them offline. The transition from traditional television to OTT TV has changed TV viewing habits. “Binge-watching” is defined as watching all session or between two and more episodes of a TV series or programs in one day. This study aims to critically evaluate the concept of “binge-watching” in the context of George Ritzer’s “McDonaldization of Society”, based on Adorno and Horkheimer’s views on television. In addition, in this study, traditional television and OTT television platforms were examined comparatively in the light of data obtained from publicly industry documents, television viewing statistics report, press releases and executive interviews. In this study, it was revealed that television viewing a movie or series is associated with consumption in a postmodern society where speed and time are important.

Although the continuation of education with the distance education method is a necessary and necessary measure taken within the scope of the epidemic, it has also caused some problems. This situation required the education system and school environments to be affected by the epidemic as a problem area. In this context, it is aimed to reveal the readiness of the educational environments for the post-epidemic and the perceptions of the educational environment after the epidemic, according to the views of teachers and architects. The study was designed with the phenomenological method, which is among the qualitative research methods. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews consisting of four sub-problem questions were conducted with a total of 15 participants, consisting of 8 architects and seven teachers. The themes and codes related to four sub-problems were obtained by analyzing the data with the descriptive analysis method. As a result of the research, it was seen that teachers and architects had views that post-epidemic educational environments should differ from pre-epidemic educational environments. In addition, according to the participants, it was determined that the educational environments should have changed before the epidemic, but that this change is now a necessity with the epidemic.

Makale Başlığı: COMPARISON OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVELS OF PREGNANTS ACCORDING TO THEIR COVID-19 STATUS
Özet: The aim of this study is to compare the anxiety and depression levels of pregnant women according to their Covid-19 status.This descriptive study was conducted in a private hospital in Istanbul. Questionnaire used as data collection tool; general information (age, education, employment, number of pregnancies, number of births), Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Depending on the subject covered in the research, Type I error (α ) is usually taken as 0.005, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10. If the subject of the research is advanced and sensitive such as physics and health sciences, Type I error is taken as 0.005 or 0.01; in fields such as social sciences, it is 0.05 or 0.10. (Ünver, Gamgam and Altunkaynak; 2019). In this study, analyzes and interpretations were made with a Type I error of 0.10. The validity and reliability of the scales were tested with Cronbach Alpha, and the Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the difference between Covid-19 transmission status according to age, number of pregnancies, number of births, Beck Anxiety and Beck Depression scales. Pearson Chi-square test was used for the relationship between Covid-19 transmission status and education and working status.A total of 137 women were included in the scope of the study. 61 of the women included in the study were diagnosed with Covid-19. 76 women were not diagnosed with Covid 19. The α value obtained for all items indicates the total reliability of that questionnaire, and the general acceptance is that this value is 0.7 and higher (Çakmur, 2012). In short, Cronbach Alpha values of the scales are expected to be higher than 0.7. In the light of this information, the Cronbach Alpha value of the Beck Anxiety Inventory, which was analyzed under 3 headings with 21 questions, was measured as 0.897. The Cronbach Alpha value of the Beck Depression Inventory was measured as 0.853. There is a relationship between education status and being diagnosed with Covid-19 (p = 0.021 < 0.10). A statistically significant result was obtained in terms of number of births (p = 0.004 < 0.10), emotional symptoms sub-dimension (p = 0.057 < 0.10) and Beck Anxiety scale (p = 0.058 < 0.10) among those diagnosed with Covid-19.In this study, anxiety and depression levels of pregnant women were examined according to their Covid-19 status. Based on the study, general anxiety status is lower in pregnant women diagnosed with Covid-19; In the emotional symptoms sub-dimension, it was concluded that it was higher. In addition, there is a statistical relationship between Covid-19 status and educational status, number of births, emotional symptoms sub-dimension and anxiety status.

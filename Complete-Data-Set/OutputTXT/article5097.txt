Makale Başlığı: Lıquıd Journalısm: The Transformatıon Of Professıonal Identıty Of Photojournalısm In The Uncertaın Dıgıtal Medıa Economy
Özet: This study examines the transformation of photojournalistic identity within the framework of Zygmunt Bauman's liquid modernity approach. Liquid modernity, characterized by constant change and uncertainty, profoundly affects the journalistic institution. In the study, the concept of "liquid journalism", adapted by Mark Deuze from Bauman's “liquid modernity” approach, is conceptualized as "liquid photojournalism". In this context, the study digs into the forces that cause journalism to face uncertainty. Along with the transition to the new media, the study discusses how the collapse of the traditional business model affects photojournalistic labor. It also approaches how the freelance model -a reflection of the individualization of working life- affects the photojournalistic identity. In the study, using phenomenology, one of the qualitative research designs, it is concluded that the photojournalistic identity undergoes a radical transformation because of the transition from traditional media to digital media. According to the findings, the economic consequences of digitalization have led to the externalization of photojournalistic labor. The freelance model causes the individualization of photojournalism work as part of the precariat work model. However, technological convergence has radically changed working practices and blurred the boundaries of professional identity. As a result, the photojournalistic identity has become ambiguous.

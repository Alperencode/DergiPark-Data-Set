Makale Başlığı: Muhadram Poet Labid b. Rabi'ah's Life and The Fakhr Theme in His Mu'allaqat
Özet: Poetry, which has an important place in Arab society, is a type of literature that dates back to pre-Islamic times. Poetry continued to maintain its importance after Islam. Due to this importance of Arabic poetry, although language scholars use the Qur'an in the first place when they apply the rule to the Arabic language grammar; They used more poems than the Qur'an in reference to Arabic poetry, which ranks in second place. The theme of fakhr in Arabic literature has been among the themes in the poems since the period of Jahiliyyah. Undoubtedly, the most important poets of the period of jahilliyyah are the mu'allaqat poets. In this study, the fourth mu'allaqat owner Labîd b.Rabi'ah al-Amiri's life and the couplets with the theme of fakhr , which he wrote only in his mu'allaqat, will be discussed. Being the only mu'allaqat owner poet whom accepted Islam, he has taken his place among muhadram poets. Labîd had worked all of the poetry themes that existed in the period of jahiliyyah in his couplets, especially in descriptive and fakhr themes. While using the theme of fakhr, he did not look for a way of gaining the admiration of others or gaining financial gain from the personalities he praised, as it was the case with some poets of the period. The fakhr poems that he wrote were to describe the characteristics of his tribe or members of the tribe. This characteristic of Labîd has given him a respected position not only among his own tribe but also among other Arab tribes.

Makale Başlığı: The Importance of Software Testing Processes and Methods in the Banking Sector
Özet: The most effective way to finance and sustain economic growth is to have a strong and healthy financial sector. The availability and maintenance of credit is vital for institutions and individuals in financing consumption, trade, construction and production. Financial institutions, whose main functions are to provide financial services needed by their customers and the economy, and to ensure the functioning of the payment system, are an important part of economic activity.

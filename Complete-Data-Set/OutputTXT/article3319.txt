Makale Başlığı: Colorful Paints Used by Urban Painter/Designers in the 18th Century Istanbul: New Documents and Questions
Özet: In early modern Ottoman historiography studies related to paints/dyes tend to focus on weaving industry, handicrafts, and history of textiles. While these studies often examine paints/dyes used in weaving and their production processes, they do not consider paints and subsidiary materials necessary for the preparation of paints that were used by urban and court painter/designers in various projects. Likewise, the color palette preferred by painter/designers and issues of patronage are not considered at all. On the basis of books of registers and documents prepared by the office of building superintendence, the chief accounting office, and clerks of the imperial council, this article explores the names and types of paints as well as subsidiary materials used by urban painter/designers in the 18th century during the projects commissioned or supervised by the imperial palace. Moreover, by considering the names of frequently mentioned paints in the documents, this article approaches possible symbolic associations of certain colors in Ottoman visual culture. Lastly, this article will consider the hierarchy of paints via the prices of certain paints as well as changes in prices of paints throughout the eighteenth century.

Makale Başlığı: EPSOM DOWNS: A PLAY WRITTEN FOR “OTHERS”
Özet: This paper aims to analyze Epsom Downs (1977) by Howard Brenton in terms of reflecting the microcosm of British society. Depicting the sordid and tragic life conditions in a capitalist society, Brenton highlights the sordid life conditions of the poor families and of the marginalized people because of their ethnicity or their sex. There will be a Marxist reading of the play in order to focus on these mentioned issues because Marxism centers on the relationship between the ruling class and the ruled one. Marx explains this relationship by introducing the terms base and the superstructure. The former is concerned with economic activity and is made up of human production relations, whereas the latter is concerned with awareness as determined by the basis. In Epsom Downs, Howard Brenton has a Marxist agenda because he is writing for the British working class and he highlights this ‘economic base’ and ‘superstructure’ relationship in line with the characters’ experiences in the racecourse. As a result, harsh conditions under which these characters have to live in the capitalist society where lower class people are marginalized and exploited by the ruling class may be illustrated with a Marxist reading of the play.

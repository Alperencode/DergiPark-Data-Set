Makale Başlığı: An Explanatory Text About Sımurg: Der Beyân-ı Ahvâl-i  Sîmurg-ı ‘Ankâ
Özet: The sky occupies an important place in archaic imaginations produced in the field of common consciousness. Birds that emerge with their tangible presence in the sky, which is considered to be closely related to the sacred, are among the most interesting elements of this area. The positive and negative bird imaginations that can change from society to society in the historical process have produced a rich literature on the subject. Simurg, which is conceived as a cosmic entity and symbolizes the sun, is the name of the mythic bird whose roots go back to ancient Persian and have variations in different cultures. While the mythical imaginations about the mythical being named as Simurg-ı Anka in the short text, which is mentioned with the Phoenix of Arabs after Islam and which is the subject of this article, were initially positive, in the Islamic tradition, they started to be presented with mostly negative views. In this study, after giving information about the origin of the legendary Simurg (Phoenix) bird whose roots are based on mythical narratives and its variations in different cultural environments, the qualifications of Simurg (Phoenix) in the short text titled Der Beyân-ı Ahvâl-i Sîmurg-ı 'Ankâ, registered with the fixture number 927/11 in the Turkish Manuscripts collection of the Yapı Kredi Sermet Çifter Research Library will be evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: Assessment of Thyroid Hormone Levels in COVID -19 Patients
Özet: OBJECTIVE: As COVID-19 affects many systems, it also affects the endocrine system. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid hormone level and disease severity of patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 service.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2020 and November 2020 hospitalized patients with positive COVID-19 PCR test and without need for intensive care were evaluated retrospectively. The study included 93 COVID-19 patients and 58 in control group of similar age and gender. Demographic characteristics, thyroid hormone levels and other laboratory values of COVID-19 and control group were compared. Patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups as those with or without lung involvement according to the chest tomography findings.RESULTS: In the COVID 19 group free T3 and free T4 levels were found to be significantly lower than the control group, while no difference was found between TSH and T3/T4 ratio. In patients with COVID-19 and lung involvement age, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase values were higher; free T3, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and albumin levels were found to be lower compared to those without lung involvement. There was a correlation between the presence of pneumonia and free T3 levels.CONCLUSION: In the course of COVID-19, thyroid functions can change depending on the severity of the disease. Assessment of thyroid function tests in hospitalized patients may give an idea about the prognosis of the disease.

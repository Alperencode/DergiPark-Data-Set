Makale Başlığı: Extendend Spectrum Beta-Lactamase with Carbapenem and Colsitin Resistance on Enterobacteriaceae Strains
Özet: Recently, antibiotic resistance has become an important risk threatening human and animal health. Multiple antibiotic drug resistance is frequently reported by researchers. An important topic on antibiotic resistance is Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamases, and the ESBL group consists of microorganisms that show multiple antibiotic resistance. ESBL positive bacteria are also present in animals and can infect humans through food. Therefore, the issue of ESBL is a common subject of both human and veterinary medicine. ESBL is followed closely by the scientific world and still continues its classification and species analysis studies. Therefore, the World Health Organization recommends regular follow-up of microorganisms that develop multiple antibiotic resistance, and ESBL screening and verification methods can be performed with various analyzes. Antibiotics containing carbapenems are reported as an important group used in human medicine, and resistance to carbapenem group antibiotics used against ESBL positive bacteria is increasing day by day. However, antibiotic resistance in the carbapenem group used against ESBL is life-threatening, especially in patients in intensive care. Colistin is known as the last resort antibiotic and used in combination then once again the focus of attention in the scientific world with these developments. The aim of this study is to reveal the importance of ESBL, carbapenems, and colistin antibiotic groups and the resistance developing against these antibiotic groups.

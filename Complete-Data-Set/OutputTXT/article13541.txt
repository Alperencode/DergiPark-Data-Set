Makale Başlığı: Determination of Resmethrin in Corn Silk Matrix by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID)
Özet: The use of pesticides provides benefits such as growing food products necessary for life, sustainability of production efficiency and prevention of diseases caused by pests. However, these benefits can turn into negative effects for humans and other living organisms with the use of pesticides in inappropriate doses and application methods. In this study, it was aimed to determine resmethrin, which belongs to the insecticide class, by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) method. Hence, a suitable temperature program was utilized to determine resmethrin at a certain retention time. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) values were recorded as 0.02 and 0.08 mg/L under the proposed conditions, respectively. After corn silk sample was extracted using acetonitrile, analytical measurements were carried out to investigate the presence of resmethrin. There was no analytical signal detected that belonged to resmethrin in the analyzed sample. Recovery experiments were performed using external calibration method with spiked samples at three different concentrations and good percent recovery results were obtained between 93 and 97%.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Surface Polishing on the Color Change of Temporary Materials Produced by Different Techniques
Özet: Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of polishing techniques and coloring agents on the color stability of temporary materials produced with different techniques.Methods: Disc-shaped samples (10*2 mm) were prepared with three different techniques (Autopolymerization, CAD/CAM and 3D printing) (N=360). The samples were divided into 4 groups according to the polishing process to be applied (n=30): (1) Polishing with jumbo stone (control), (2) Polishing with goat brush and diamond-containing polishing paste, (3) Soflex polishing system, (4) Optragloss polishing system. The first color values were measured and the samples were divided into 3 groups according to the coloring agent (distilled water, coffee, red wine) (n=10). Six days later, the second color measurements of the samples were made and ∆E00 (color change) values were calculated. Data were analyzed with the three-way Robust method. Bonferroni corrected Lincon test was used for multiple comparisons of non-normally distributed color change values according to material, polishing process and coloring agents (p< 0.05).Results: The materials produced with the CAD/CAM technique showed the lowest ΔE00 values, while the materials produced with the 3D printing technique showed the highest ΔE00 values. Polishing with a goat brush showed the highest ΔE00 values, while polishing with 2-step diamond-containing wheel showed the lowest ΔE00 values. Again, while red wine showed the highest ΔE00 values, distilled water showed the lowest ΔE00 values.Conclusion: In fixed temporary restorations planned for long-term use, color stability is affected by both the material and the applied surface polishing process, as well as the coloring agent.

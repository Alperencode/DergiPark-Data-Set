Makale Başlığı: A BUILDING WITH MOSAIC IN THE PATARA HARBOR STREET
Özet: This article is about a mosaic uncovered during the excavations in chamber II on the west portico of the Harbor Street of Patara that connects the city center to the harbor. The mosaic in question was located on the second floor of the relevant space. The mosaic, which is heavily damaged and consists of many small fragments, is the third example uncovered after those founds in the Women’s Chapel and Harbor Bath at Patara. After restoration work was completed in 2013, it was discovered that the mosaic was made up of a panel surrounded by three borders. Utilizing seven various tessera kinds, this geometric patterned mosaic was created using the opus tessellatum process. With the colors ordered from dark to bright in the pattern processing, the motifs have been given a sense of depth. Filling motifs are utilized in the gaps of the circular main design to produce more intricate ornamentation. The Pataran mosaic’s design repertory and building technique, as well as the excavation results, place it in the 5th century AD. This mosaic, the topic of the first comprehensive study of Pataran mosaics, is a unique example of floor mosaics found in Lycia and Western Anatolia, particularly in Patara. Furthermore, this study opens questions about the mosaic repertoire of the region, construction techniques, and the identification of possible new workshops.

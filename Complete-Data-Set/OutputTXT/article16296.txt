Makale Başlığı: UN Intervention in Ethnic Based Conflicts: Rwanda and Bosnia
Özet: The biggest test of UN peacekeeping operations in the 21st century is the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia. This is because the UN was incapable of preventing the genocide that took place in both countries. Therefore, these two case studies were not chosen by chance. In two case studies, the role of UN peacekeeping operations in Rwanda and Bosnia, as well as the outcome of genocide caused by ethnic hatred, will be addressed. Thus, this study will answer three main questions. Firstly, what is the origin of ethnic hatred in Rwanda and Bosnia and its role in the genocide? Secondly, What is the role of UN in ethnic wars such as Rwanda and Bosnia? Lastly, What are the similarities and differences between Rwanda and Bosnia genocide based on ethnic reasons? In this context, it was concluded that ethnic and racial differences caused genocide in both countries and the UN intervention in Rwanda and Bosnia could not be effective due to the high level of ethnic hatred.

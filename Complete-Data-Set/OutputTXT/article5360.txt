Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION FOR CONTAMINATIONS OF RAW MILK ON MILK COLLECTION UNITS IN NEVSEHIR PROVINCE
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to investigate Aflatoxin M1 and heavy metal pollution in raw milk samples taken from milk collection centers operating in Nevsehir province. As a result of the analyzes made on raw milk samples; The amount of Aflatoxin M1 was determined in the range of 0.013-0.150 ppb, in 7 raw milk samples remained below the measurement limit. A limit of 0.05 ppb has been determined for Aflatoxin M1 in the Turkish Food Codex and the amount of Aflatoxin M1 was determined above the legal limit in 15% of the raw milk samples taken. As a result of heavy metal analysis with ICP-MS in raw milk samples, Mg 41,96±1,88 ppm; Ca 79,83±4,30 ppm; Mn 0,0115±0,007 ppm; Fe 0,176±0,003 ppm; Ni 0,0283±0,002 ppm; Cu 0,0181±0,003 ppm; Zn 1,56±0,005 ppm; As 0,0046±0,000 ppm; Cd 0,001549±0,002 ppm and Pb 0,00048±0,000 ppm were found, respectively. According to our study results, it was determined that there was no risk human health risk in terms of heavy metal.

Makale Başlığı: Methanol Intoxication without Optic Atrophy and Central Damage
Özet: We aimed to present our case of total blindness without intracerebral lesions and optic atrophy after methanol intoxication during the first 3 months. A 28-year-old male patient was consulted to the emergency department with complaints of a sudden decrease in vision, nausea, and dizziness was evaluated in terms of ocular findings. It was learned that he had taken 400-500 ml of alcohol made at home, about 16 hours ago, the evening before his story. In the ophthalmological examination of the patient, the pupils were bilaterally fixed and dilated. Bilateral visual acuity was found to be light perception. There was no pathological feature in anterior segment examination. Intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye by Goldmann’s applanation tonometry. The optic disc and macula were observed normally in the examination after dilatation. At the 3rd-month follow-up examination, his visual acuity was at the level of light perception. The patient stated that he had difficulty seeing in daylight due to photophobia and that he could see more easily in the evenings and dim light. Acute alcohol poisoning has high morbidity and mortality and should be taken seriously and managed promptly. Delay of treatment can cause complications, permanent damage or death. However, it can leave permanent damage despite early and full intervention. It may take time for these permanent damage to become visible anatomically.

Makale Başlığı: Non-Fermenting Gram-Negative Isolates as Infecting Agents and Antibiotic Resistance: Three-Year Data
Özet: Objective: This study aimed to investigate clinical non-fermenting gram-negative isolates and antibiotic resistance profiles for three years in a tertiary hospital.Materials and Methods: A total of 3817 non-fermenting gram-negative strains isolated from various cultures between January 2017 and December 2019 in Balıkesir Atatürk City Hospital were investigated retrospectively. Identification and antibiotic susceptibilities were performed using conventional methods and PhoenixTM 100 system (Becton Dickinson, MA, USA).Results: A total of 2201 (57.7%) P. aeruginosa, 1283 (33.6%) A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, 202 (5.3%) S. maltophilia and 131 (3.4%) B. cepacia complex strains were identified. The majority of strains were isolated from intensive care units (54.5%), followed by internal medicine (33.4%) and surgical services (12.1%). All A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex species showed over 70% resistance to most antibiotics. In addition to β-lactam antibiotic resistance (generally over 30%), resistance to fluoroquinolones (30.4%) seemed to have particular importance. Co-trimoxazole showed below 10% resistance in S. maltophilia isolates. In B. cepacia complex, ceftazidime resistance increased in years (2018, 22.2%; 2019, 67.0%). Conclusion: The issue of antibiotic resistance cannot be won by just developing novel antimicrobials, but also by increasing the efficiency of current ones. The first step is to “diagnose” the current condition, like local surveillance studies.

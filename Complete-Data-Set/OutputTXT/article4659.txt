Makale Başlığı: Perceptions Towards the Effects of Exposure to Phubbing Behavior on Learning-Teaching Processes
Özet: The current place and intensity of mobile device use areincreasing day by day. This increase leads to the emergence of negative situations such as phubbing behavior. This study aims to examine the effects of phubbing behavior, which is a relatively new phenomenon, on learning processes. For this purpose, data were collected from 148 higher education students about their exposure to phubbing. Research findings indicate that there is a relationship between the participants' perceptions of being exposed to phubbing and their perceptions of influencing learning processes. Accordingly, students who state that they are relatively less exposed to phubbing state that displaying phubbing behavior in the classroom during the learning-teaching process has a relatively less negative impact on the learning-teaching processes of their teachers, friends and themselves. The opposite of this situation can also be said. Considering the place and development of mobile devices in daily life, new instructional designs, emerging mobile devices, can be considered in order to overcome such negativities and even to experience more effective and efficient learning-teaching processes.

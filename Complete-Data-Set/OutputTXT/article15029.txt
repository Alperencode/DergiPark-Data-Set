Makale Başlığı: The student's evaluation of the delivery of the theoretical courses due to warning mask and social distance during the pandemic condition
Özet: The pandemic condition changed the style of teaching and learning in the wide world. Particularly some measurements such as warning masks and social distance influenced the quality of the education in the higher education. A five-scale Likert questionnaire was designed to ask the architecture students to evaluate the quality of the delivery of the theoretical courses in the department. SPSS was applied to analyze data with quantitative methods. The results revealed that the students generally were satisfied with the quality of courses and the delivery methods. However, the Chi-square analysis demonstrated that just a few factors were associated with the quality of the delivery of the courses and other factors did not statistically associate with the evaluation of the students. In conclusion, the students evaluate the quality of the teaching in a holistic approach and apparently contextual factors influence the judgment of the students during the pandemic time of teaching and learning.

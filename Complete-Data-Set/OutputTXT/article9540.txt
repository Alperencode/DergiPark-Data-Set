Makale Başlığı: Some generalised extended incomplete beta functions and applications
Özet: This paper introduces generalised incomplete beta functions defined by the generalised beta function. Firstly, we provide some of the generalised beta function's basic properties, such as integral representations, summation formulas, Mellin transform, and beta distribution. We then present several fundamental properties, such as integral representations, summation formulas, and recurrence relations with the help of the generalised incomplete beta functions.

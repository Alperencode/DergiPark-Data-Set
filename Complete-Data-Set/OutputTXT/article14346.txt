Makale Başlığı: Isis's Covid -19 Statement: An Analysis In The Scope Of Voice Of Hind Journal
Özet: Today, terrorist organizations actively use the media to achieve their goals, prepare propaganda and actions, and supply the organization with personnel. For ISIS, a global terrorist organization, the media and evolving communication technologies have become an important tool for achieving its goals. ISIS is able to turn times of crisis into opportunities, and actively used the new media to its advantage during the Kovid 19 pandemic, which affected the entire world and became a crisis. This study examines how the pandemic is treated in the discourse of ISIS. In this context, the organization's Voice of Hind magazine is selected as an example, and issues of the magazine published in English in a digital environment between 2020 and 2021 are examined for Kovid 19 content and subjected to discourse analysis. The result of the analysis is that ISIS, a religiously motivated terrorist organization, uses the climate of fear and anxiety created by the pandemic as a means to incite hatred. It is found that the organization instrumentalizes the social conditions created by the pandemic period in this sense by making them part of its propaganda in pursuit of its own goals, using contradictory language, and trying to create a perception of victimization by supporting its discourse with visual images.

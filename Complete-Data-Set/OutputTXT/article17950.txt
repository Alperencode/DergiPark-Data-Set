Makale Başlığı: Samtskhe-Javakheti Region: A Neglected Keypoint for European Security of Energy Supply?*
Özet: It is no doubt that therise of new energy actors in post-Soviet geographic space such as Azerbaijan,Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan was welcomed by Western power centers. Thoseemerging actors were assessed as partners in diminishing Europe’s energydependence to a single supplier; the Russian Federation. In this context, themain Western initiatives to challenge Russian energy dominance regarding theCaspian Basin were the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, and SouthCaucasus gas pipeline. These two strategic pipelines pass through theterritories of Samtskhe-Javakheti region of Georgia - a tiny administrativeunit adjacent to the Turkish city of Ardahan and Armenian city of Gyumri.Because of that, any political turmoil in that strategic region should easilyturn into a factor endangering both already unsatisfactory regional stabilityand European energy security.In this article,Samtskhe-Javakheti region’s economic and demographic characteristics that makeit unique and prone to instability are analyzed and European Union’sSamtskhe-Javakheti policy is evaluated through the lens of security of energysupply. The conclusion of the paper is that, the European Union failed toestablish influential cooperation mechanisms to avoid political and economicinstabilities in this transit region. The European Union simply lacks acomprehensive regional plan compatible with the sociological and economicrealities of Samtskhe-Javakheti

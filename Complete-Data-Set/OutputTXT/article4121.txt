Makale Başlığı: Kalam, the Analytic Tradition, and the Importance of Philosophy of Religion in Turkey
Özet: The philosophy of religion is a relatively young academic field with its own goals and questions. However, as a discipline taught as part of theological education in Turkey, there are various issues concerning its nature and aims. First, the emergence of philosophy of religion in both Europe and Turkey will be evaluated to explain doctrinal neutrality and objectivity. Secondly, in order to determine what unique contributions the philosophy of religion makes, the objects, methods and aims of the field will be examined and compared with its (closest) brother, kalam. Thirdly, the issues of approach and method in the philosophy of religion will be discussed in connection to religious belief and thought. In these sections, we try to refute some unfavourable conceptions of philosophy and its relation to religion. To this end, we identify four levels to the philosophy of religion as found in the Analytical tradition. It is hoped that distinguishing between these four levels explains how the claim that philosophy is opposed to religious creed is invalid. Also, we here aim to present certain reasons that suggest philosophical questions about Islamic beliefs are better understood and answered at the educational level through the explanation and evaluation of theories about religion as practiced the analytic tradition than continental philosophy. Finally, the choice and range of topics addressed and sources used in philosophy of religion lessons is discussed in relation to Islamic tradition. It is argued here that the disciple can help the development of kalam by using sources that it almost exclusively studies.

Makale Başlığı: Effects of Agricultural Support Corn Agriculture in Turkey
Özet: It faces risks and uncertainties due to its unique characteristics and nature. For this reason, it is not possible to increase or decrease the supply of agricultural products in a short time. According to these characteristics, it is important to have support in agriculture sector and to develop support policies for products.Turkey as well as all over the world to increase agricultural production support policies are used as a tool. In this research, carried out agricultural subsidies for corn production in Turkey (dieselfertilizer support, Turkish Grain Board (TMO) purchases) and the most important inputs used in corn production of diesel and fertilizer prices; the effects on corn cultivation areas have been examined. This research was carried between 1982-2017 periods.Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the relation between agricultural support and motorfertilizer price and corn cultivation area and an econometric model was established. In agricultural production, when producers decide on their production, they usually take into consideration the prices of the products for the previous year. Therefore, in the model, the previous year's real prices of the independent variables were used. According to the results of the model, there is a positive and linear relationship between Turkish Grain Board (TMO) purchase prices, diesel fuel-fertiliser support and corn cultivation areas as expected.Between motor and fertiliser prices and corn cultivation areas, a positive and linear relationship was found, contrary to expectations.This work has been put forward in corn production situation in Turkey and in the world, it is examined the effects of agricultural subsidies in corn farming in Turkey and focused on policies to be followed in order to increase the self-sufficiency rate

Makale Başlığı: pH controlled release of doxorubicin from Fe3O4@-CRG-graft-PDMAEMA magnetic nanoparticles
Özet: In recent years, the effectiveness of magnetically biocompatible nanoparticles in cancer treatment has been increased. Targeted drug delivery system has recently emerged as a promising cancer treatment because it reduces the side effects of traditional cancer treatment methods and increases the effectiveness of treatment. In our study, hybrid magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized. Nanoparticles consist of an inorganic iron oxide core (Fe3O4) and an organic copolymer (-CRG-graft-PDMAEMA). The magnetic nanoparticles’ structure was characterized by UV and  Zeta-sizer  techniques. Fe3O4@-CRG-graft-PDMAEMA@DOX magnetic nanoparticles were obtained by loading the anti-tumor cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) on the synthesized Fe3O4@-CRG-graft-PDMAEMA nanoparticles. The in vitro release of drug-loaded magnetic nanoparticles in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and acidic medium (pH 1.2) at 37 °C was investigated. It has been shown that the synthesized Fe3O4@-CRG-graft-PDMAEMA@DOX magnetic nanoparticles are pH sensitive and have high release performance. The DOX release of Fe3O4@-CRG-graft-PDMAEMA@DOX nanoparticles in pH 7.4, pH 5.5 and pH 1.2 mediums was found to be 66.53%, 70.08% and 90.47% s, respectively. Kinetic calculations of magnetic nanoparticles were made. The iron content of magnetic nanoparticles was found to be 66.77%.

Makale Başlığı: Classification of Hydrocephalus Disease and Determination of Related  Factors by Machine Learning Method
Özet: The first objective of this research is to classify babies with and without hydrocephalus by means of support vector machines  SVM  constructed by various kernel functions and Random Forest  RF  methods generated by different branching criteria. The data analyzed in this study were retrospectively selected from the database of the Department of Pediatric, Turgut Özal Medical Center, Inonu University. The data included in the study include babies with and without hydrocephalus and risk factors related to these babies. SVM and RF models were used for classification of hydrocephalus. As performance evaluation metrics; accuracy, classification error, kappa statistic, area under the ROC curve  AUC , f-measure, sensitivity, specificity and Youden index were used. For SVM models, the best classification performances were obtained by the SVM with ANOVA kernel model. The performance metrics  with 95% confidence interval  were respectively; 72.14% ± 8.99 for accuracy, 27.86% ± 8.99 for classification error, 0.424 ± 0.209 for kappa statistic, 0.748 ± 0.120 for AUC, 75.78% ± 6.97 for f measurement, 71.45% ± 8.27 for sensitivity, 73.00% ± 22.13 and 0.404 ± 0.221 for Youden index. For RF models, the best classification performances were obtained by RF constructed by the Gini Index. The performance metrics  with 95% confidence interval  were respectively; 77.47% ± 9.51 for accuracy, 22.53% ± 9.51 for classification error, 0.554 ± 0.193 for kappa statistic, 0.799 ± 0.100 for AUC, 78.89% ± 9.43 for f measurement, 71.90%± 15.10 for sensitivity, 87.00% ± 19.23 and 0.589 ± 0.197 for Youden index. The best classification performance to predict Hydrocephalic achieved by RF model. As future study, more sophisticate machine learning algorithms will be used to improve classification performance of the Hydrocephalic

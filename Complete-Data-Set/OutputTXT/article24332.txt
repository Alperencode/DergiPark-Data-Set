Makale Başlığı: The localisations of intracranial lipoma
Özet: Abstract IntroductionIntracraniallipomas are accepted to be developed congenital.  They are usually located midline and associatedwith corpus callosum dysgenesis. Purpose of this study is to define ofcomputerized tomography (CT) imaging features of intracranial lipomas / lipomatosis. Materials and Methods Atotal of 600 patients who underwent brain CT imaging for various reasons wereanalyzed retrospectively and sypmtoms of patients, the presence, localizationand size of lipomas/ lipomatosis were evaluated. Results: Intracraniallipoma/lipomatosis were observed 70 patients. Total lipom/lipomatosis numberwas 124. We found most frequent localization on falx cerebri (%93 of allcases). Most frequent symptom was headache in study population. Mean size of lipoma/lipomatosiswas measured 4,6x2,3 mm. Conclusion:Smallintracranial lipoma/lipomatosis are common lesions on brain CT. Altough theyare usually asymptomatic and detected incidentally, they are rarely known tocause neurological symptoms. Knowing localization and imaging features ofintracranial lipoma/lipomatosis will improve differential diagnosis.

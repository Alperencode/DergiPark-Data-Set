Makale Başlığı: TWO BODYS OF THE LAW: THE PLACE OF ARISTOTLE IN THE DICOTOMY OF NATURAL AND POSITIVE LAW
Özet: Aristotle's philosophy, a cornerstone and foundation for the philosophy of law, has an important place for natural and positive law, two debates that are separated from each other with sharp boundaries today. However, Aristotle's distinction between the natural and positivity of the law was less than it is today. Aristotle added political justice to these two mindsets and brought the philosophy of law to a different perspective. In our study, we will touch upon the reasons why Aristotle deals with natural and man-made law under political justice, at the same time, based on the contradiction (mutability and immutability) of the Aristotelian natural law expression, we will touch on whether it expresses a natural law idea in the Stoic and Thomas Aquinasian sense.

Makale Başlığı: Factors Affecting Early Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with Complete Cytoreduction for Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
Özet: Objective: Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy practice is the combined treatment modality used in selected patients for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis.Material and Methods: In our study, we investigated the development of early complications and the factors affecting the early stages of complications in patients who underwent Cytoreductive Surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy due to peritoneal metastases of tumors of different origin. Medical records of 76 patients who operated in our hospital for peritoneal metastasis between 2014 and 2019 evaluated retrospectively.  Only 61 patients who underwent complete cytoreduction (CC/0) included in the study. Results: Peritoneal Cancer Index and operation time found to be independent risk factors for major complication development. In terms of major complication development, operation time and Peritoneal Cancer Index cutoff value found to be 7 hours and 10 respectively. Conclusion: We have demonstrated in our study that the fact that the PCI is higher than ten and operation time lasts more than 7 hours is the reason that increases major complications and mortality in patients undergoing CC/0. All efforts should be made to perform CC/0 resection, but more care should be taken in patients having a PCI over 10 and when extending the operation time over 7 hours. In these patients, postoperative complications increase peri-operative mortality and lead to early recurrence and short survival.

Makale Başlığı: REBUS SIC STANTIBUS (Fundamental Changes in Conditions) PRINCIPLE ON THE ROAD TO THE MONTREAUX CONVENTION
Özet: This study argues that the new order established by Turkey with the Montreux Convention is based on the principle of rebus sic stantibus, which is one of the essential principles of international treaty law. According to the relevant principle, it is emphasized that if the conditions at the time of conclusion of a treaty have undergone radical changes, the application of the treaty becomes impossible. This presents a traditional way of ending the provisions of treaties concluded within the system. Turkiye argued that the order established by the Lausanne Treaty on Straits underwent radical changes, and therefore the status of the Straits should be determined with a new agreement. From this point of view, in this study, it is argued that Turkiye complies with international law and diplomacy and acts in good faith to change the Straits regime. To support this argument and trace the principle of rebus sic stantibus, methodologically, the newspapers of the period were scanned. In addition to this, doctrinal research was used, and state archives benefitted. In this study, the document analysis method, one of the qualitative research methods, was utilized.

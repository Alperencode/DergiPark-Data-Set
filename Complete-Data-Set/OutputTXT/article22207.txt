Özet: In our developing world, the increase in the social welfare level of societies compared to the past has increased the sensitivity of the majority of consumers on food consumption and has changed their purchasing behavior along with the workload. However, in recent years, the increase of substances and risks that threaten human health through food has made food production and safety one of the strategically important issues. Because it is known that societies can no longer reach safe food due to environmental and social problems. Consumers constitute the most important link of food safety and can direct the sector with their purchasing power and awareness level. In this study, the awareness levels of individuals living in different regions of our country, with different economic and welfare levels, on food safety were investigated and their attitudes and behaviors on food consumption were tried to be determined. Within the scope of the study, a survey consisting of 27 questions in total was applied to 1015 consumers in cities that could represent the whole country, face-to-face or online and data obtained were evaluated statistically. As a result of the study, it has been determined that gender, education and economic differences of the consumers significantly affect consciousness level of the society and their sensitivity to food purchasing.

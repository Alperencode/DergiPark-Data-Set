Makale Başlığı: The Comments of Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani On Al-Hafiz Al-Azdi in Fath Al-Bari Critical Analysis Study
Özet: Examining and studying the narrators of the isnads is a science that Allah has bestowed on scholars to know the condition of the narrators who are the main link of isnad chains and the authenticity of the texts depend on them. This science is bound by the principles on which it is built, and the rules to which it is referred. It depends on the results reached by the great hadith scholars where their huge experience of hadith and chains plays an important role. Their sayings may agree or differ about narrators. The problem of the study comes in the statement of the seriousness of one scholar’s critics against trustful narrator by the majority of Jarh and Ta’deel scholars. This problem becomes more serious when the critic is without evidence towards narrators mentioned in AL-Bukhari’s Sahih. This study aims to collect the places in which Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani (d. 852 AH) commented on the critics of Abu Al-Fath Al-Azdi (d. 374 AH) in the book “Fath Al-Bari” And to show the critical aspect in the approach of Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, as well as whether Al-Azdi was right in his pursuit or wrong in his criticism, In light of the Jarh and Ta’deel, according to a critical analytical and inductive approach. I found twenty narrators in this context, the most important result reached by the study is that the critics issued by Al-Azdi were abnormal because they violated the rulings of the great critics on the one hand, and were not based on an argument, document or evidence on the other.

Makale Başlığı: Necatigil's ‘Konuk İşçi’ Poem in the Context of Labor Migration
Özet: The phenomenon of migration has quicklyfound its place in literature, like many social events. The need of our expatriate citizens to write down their feelings has been the biggest factor that constitutes the starting point of migration literature. However, contributions to migration literature are not limited to writers living in a foreign country and contributing to the literature of this country. Some writers and poets in Turkey also contributed to the migration literature. Behçet Necatigil, whose poem named Konuk İşçi was published in Yeni Dergi (Number: 98) in November 1972, is one of our poets who contributed to the migration literature from Turkey. This study attempts to show the reflection of the migration phenomenon on Necatigil's Konuk İşçi poem in the light of the poet's understanding of poetry.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Preschool Teachers' Views on Family Involvement in the Post-Pandemic Education Process
Özet: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected daily life all over the world, as well as educational activities. In Turkey, as in the rest of the world, measures have been taken, including closing schools and conducting distance education, to reduce the negative effects of the pandemic. Family participation studies in pre-school education are a very important factor and affect the continuity and permanence of education. For this reason, it is important to reveal the practices of family participation in the process we are in and to find solutions to the needs. A case study, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in this study, which aims to examine the family involvement studies that preschool teachers have applied in the post-pandemic education process. The study was carried out with 13 Preschool Teachers working in different provinces throughout Turkey. Data were obtained with an open-ended questionnaire. As a result of the study, it was seen that the family participation studies carried out in the post-pandemic period have changed. The teachers stated that they informed the families about the activities at school or gave homework that they could do together at home, but it was determined that this was not sufficient for effective family ınvolvement.

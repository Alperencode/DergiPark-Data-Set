Makale Başlığı: Temperament, Character, Personality Characteristics and Eating Attitudes of People Seeking Bariatric Surgery
Özet: Objective: This study aimed to analyze differences in temperament, character, personality characteristics and eating attitudes between the patients seeking bariatric surgery for the treatment of obesity and the general population.Methods: The candidates for bariatric surgery were assessed pre-operatively using the Temperament-Character Inventory (TCI) and Personality Belief Questionnaire (PBQ) for personality characteristics, and the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) for their eating behavior. Results: The candidates for bariatric surgery had higher scores on the Impulsivity and Compassionate sub-dimensions of the TCI, whilst the score on the Self sub-dimension was lower than in the controls. No significant differences were found between patients and controls in the subscales of the Personality Belief Questionnaire. The candidates for bariatric surgery were found to have more impaired eating habits.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that certain personality characteristics may both cause obesity and may be effective in the treatment method used to treat obesity. Taking into account the personality characteristics of patients and assessing their eating patterns when determining therapeutic approaches to obesity, including bariatric surgery, may be beneficial in achieving effective, long-term results in weight control. In patients scheduled for bariatric surgery for the treatment of obesity, providing individualized psychiatric support to develop their impulsivity-related self-control skills may enhance the success of obesity treatment.

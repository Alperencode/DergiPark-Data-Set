Makale Başlığı: PIERRE BOURDIEU: HABITUS IN THE STRUCTURAL REASON
Özet: The daily struggles that occur between the actors facilitating the understanding of social phenomena in order to maintain the pattern characteristic of the era are specifically designed in location and placement. Together with numerous and repeated questions, the structural reason refers to creating unique insights into multifaceted phenomena, to the habitus in cultural processes about their functioning, to making sense of the self. In the structural reason, an agent's positioning in social space inherits the immanent teachings of the social world as integral components of the same design. In Bourdieu sociology, the authority to define and legitimize cultural values requires acquiring an objective measure of distance and academic experience in the research problem of the relevant approach to understanding the frequency of contexts. This article focuses on some important contributions in the methodology of habitus-oriented social science rather than the causes of the themes and sub-themes identified in Bourdieu's sociology. In this direction, in the article, habitus, one of the main parameters of Bourdieu sociology, will be discussed in the axis of structural reason.

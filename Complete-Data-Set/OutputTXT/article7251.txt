Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Genotype x Environment Interactions by AMMI Analysis of Oilseed Sunflower Genotypes Grown  in Different Environmental Conditions
Özet: Genotype-environment interaction is an important factor limiting yield in sunflower as in other plants. Stability of the genotypes was investigated by using AMMI analysis in terms of seed yield obtained from oil sunflower genotypes grown under multi-environmental conditions. This work; The study was carried out with a total of twelve oil sunflower genotypes in six locations for two years (2016 and 2017) in a randomized block design with four replications. The most stablegenotypes and genotypes compatible with special environments were tried to be determined by AMMI analysis. With AMMI analysis, it was determined that the mean of squares was affected by the environment with 73.5%, interaction with 19.5% and genotype with 7.0%. According to the results of the analysis, the G3, G8 genotypes are quite stable and together with these varieties, the G4, G6, G7, G9 and G10 genotypes have a seed yield above the average, the G1 genotype has a very low seed yield, and the G9, G10 and G11 are located quite far from the stability line. therefore, they were found to be unstable. When the environments were evaluated with AMMI analysis, it was determined that E5 was the most suitable and highly productive, and together with this environment, E10 and E11 resulted in a seed yield above the average yield. In addition, in the sector analysis made, it is seen that G4 and G6 are high in E3, E4, E7, E10 and E11 circles, G8, G7 and G1 are high in E1, E2, E5, E6 E8 and E12 circles, and G2 and G9 are only high in E9 circles. performance and were specifically recommended for these environments, while other remaining genotypes such as G1 and G5 were not associated with environments. As a result, visually the most stable and high yielding genotypes were determined by AMMI analysis.

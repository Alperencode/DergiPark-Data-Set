Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effects of Whey Powder on Haematococcus pluvialis Cell Growth Kinetics
Özet: This study was carried out to examine the effect on the growth of Haematococcus pluvialis using low-cost whey powder (WP). The H. pluvialis used in this study were from Çukurova University, Faculty of Fisheries, and 70% demineralized WP from Cici Dairy Industry Trade Inc. The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions with 3 replications. During this experiment, cell numbers and biomass were analyzed every day. In addition, the specific growth rate of H. pluvialis was calculated according to the Monod Equivalence. The mean values of the cell number following the WP application were calculated according to the groups (C, W5, W10 and W15) as 763.34±419.62 cells/ml, 951.60±388.20 cells/ml, 1105.27±380.35 cells/ml and 978.63±411.07 cells/ml, respectively. The mean biomass value has been found the lowest in the control group (0.84±0.36 g/l), and the highest value in the W15 group (1.26±0.55 gl-1). The mean specific growth rate was determined as 0.52±0.09 day-1 in the control group, 0.56±0.1 day-1 in the W5 group, 0.56±0.14 day-1 in the W10 group, and as 0.61±0,09 day-1 in the W15 group. In accordance with the data obtained, both the biomass and the specific growth rate of H. pluvialis were observed to increase in the W15 group. The use of WP as a nutrient medium is recommended due to its low-cost as well as increasing biomass.

Makale Başlığı: Design and implementation of microstrip antenna at 915 MHz carrier frequency for RF energy harvesting
Özet: Nowadays, Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting systems are called an alternative energy source and target to use the electromagnetic energy available in the environment. One of the purposes of these energy harvesting systems is to extend battery life by being used with communication systems with low power consumption. RF energy harvesting system consists of antenna, impedance matching, RF rectifier circuit, DC filter circuit and load. In this study, a microstrip antenna model with a carrier frequency of 915 MHz and a bandwidth of 200 MHz was designed with the help of HFSS program that solves electromagnetic structures by finite element method. The proposed antenna size of 79x100x1.6 mm3 has been optimized using parametric analysis. Later, designed antenna is fabricated on a low profile FR4 substrate. In the last step, the measurements of the antenna were taken by the vector network analyzer device and the characteristics such as return loss, VSWR and radiation pattern were evaluated. The designed antenna gain is calculated as 2.38 dB. In addition, it has been observed that the measurement and simulation results of the antenna are compatible. Finally, considering the results of this study, it has been determined that the proposed antenna is suitable for RF energy harvesting systems operating at 915 MHz carrier frequency.

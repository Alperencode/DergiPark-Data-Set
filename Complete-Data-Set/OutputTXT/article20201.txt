Makale Başlığı: Determination of Adult Population Fluctuation and Damege Rate of Drosophila suzukii Matsumura 1931 (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in Cherry and Nectarine Orchards
Özet: Drosophila suzukii Matsumura 1931 (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is an invasive species causing significant economic damage in fruits. In this study, the change of adult population and damage rate as well as the preference of fruit maturity periods in the nectarine and cherry orchards were determined. Prepared apple cider vinegar traps were used in four nectarine and four cherry orchards in Adana and Mersin provinces between 2017-2018. As a result of the study, it was found that the D. suzukii population increased between the period when the fruits, which were described as becoming juicy (yellow maturation) in the spring, began to sugar by changing color, and the harvest period and in autumn months. It was also observed that the pest adults preferred the pink-red and dark red maturity period of the fruits to lay eggs and with this, the damage also occurred during this period. While no damage was detected in early nectarine varieties, 2% damage was detected in the first year and 62% in the second year in cherries.

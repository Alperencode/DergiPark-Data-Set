Makale Başlığı: The Intersecting Points of the Akhism and Career Anchors
Özet: Ahilik Organization has an important place in Turkish culture. The organization has a great contribution in providing solidarity, unity and togetherness in the Anatolian lands with the task it has undertaken. Established as a tradesman's organization in its first years, the Ahi community later became active in many fields such as trade, art, education, and economy. One of the main objectives of the Ahi Organization was to train employees who prioritize business ethics in every business line and who will do their job continuously. In this context, within the organization, there was a process in which employees such as assistantship, apprenticeship and mastership, which could be called the career steps of that day, were subjected to continuous training. The aim of this study is to investigate the place of the factors that shape the career of the person called career anchors in the Akhism by highlighting the talents, needs and values of the person. In this framework, the conceptual dimensions, features and cutting points of the Ahi-Order and career anchors are theoretically discussed and examined.

Makale Başlığı: DETERMINATION OF THE PARAMETERS THAT CONSTITUTE THE PRICE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES: THE CASE OF ÇANKAYA DISTRICT, ANKARA PROVINCE
Özet: In the study, the parameters that are effective in the price formation of residential independent sections in the Çankaya district of Ankara province were evaluated using spatial econometric methods, according to the results returned by the Least Squares (EKK), Spatial Error (SEM), Spatial Auto Regressive (SAR) and Spatial Durbin models (SDM). The correct determination of the property tax as the most important income input of the municipalities depends on the estimation of the price of the independent section as accurately as possible, and the correct estimation of the price depends on the correct determination of the parameters that make up the price. Social interaction in the examined unit through the effect of building stocks determined by the rho coefficient, which is one of the outputs of spatial econometrics, on each other's prices, should also be taken into account during the creation of certain regions. The environment interaction returned by the Durbin model can be used as a tool to determine which social layers are effective on which price formation. Accurate evaluation of spatial econometric results will help to make decisions on many issues from price formation to the interaction of social strata. In the study, it has been revealed that the effective parameters on the declared value of the real estate arise especially by excluding the declared value from the equation, so how important it is to determine the declared value correctly. In this context, the obligation of municipalities to receive support from professional institutions has emerged as one of the involuntary results of the study.

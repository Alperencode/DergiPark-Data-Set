Makale Başlığı: Perspective of the Turkish Press on the Palestine and East Turkestan Problem
Özet: The Republic of Turkey is among the states that are striving to find solutions to international problems. It is one of the states that can adopt a particular attitude in the face of the injustices occurring in the world. This attitude includes all victims regardless of language, religion and race. In the preface to the book Uyghurs by the East Turkestan writer Turgun Almas, it is stated that Turkey does not focus enough on the issue of East Turkestan. In the preface written by the translator Ahsen Batur declared that "The reaction shown in Turkey against the atrocity that China has exhibited in East Turkestan remains incapable, and those who think of Islam as consisting of ablution and prayer, formalist, hypocrite side and their political representatives ignore the clamor of Muslims in East Turkestan when they always talk about Palestine”. In this study, it will be analyzed whether the Palestinian issue expressed by Batur has been raised more than the East Turkestan issue. Quantitative content analysis method was used in the study. 3 National newspapers publishing in Turkey have been analyzed. It has been observed that the Palestinian issue has been covered more in the Turkish press and that there is more content which supports Palestine.

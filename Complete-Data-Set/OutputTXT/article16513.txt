Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Evaluation of the Results of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and the Effects of Risk Factors in Patients With Relaps/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
Özet: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is a standard treatment applied after rescue treatment for relapse/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). In our study, we aimed to determine the disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed relapse/refractory HL who applied AHSCT in our center and to examine the effect of risk factors on survival. Thirty-five (11%) of 314 patients who underwent AHSCT between January 2009 and March 2020 and followed up in our center were defined HL. 46% of the patients were female. The median age of diagnosis was 29(14-62), and the transplantation age was 33(22-62). After primary chemotherapy; 66% of patients remained in remission, 34% refractory. The rescue treatment’s result applied to relapse/refractory HL, 68% refractory. 26% complete and 6% partial response. After AHSCT, the patients accomplished remission of 49% and developed relapsed 51%. The result of the treatment applied to patients who relapsed after AHSCT was accomplished remission in 39%, considered refractory at 17%, and died at 44%. The patients who died after AHSCT died 88% from lymphoma and died 12% from causes other. After AHSCT, the mean OS of patients was 99(±8.9); the mean DFS was 60(±10.7) months The time-to-relapse being less than 12 months (p=0.033) and normal sedimentation at relapse (p=0.021) were found to be substantial on DFS, and normal LDH at relapse (p=0.022) was found to be substantial on OS. In multivariate analysis, no prognostic risk factor was detected affecting OS. On the other hand, that was found that the increase in hemoglobin at diagnosis on PFS increased the risk of relapse 1.67 times; increase in one-unit neutrophil engraftment decreased the risk of relapse by 30%, and the time-to-relapse being over 12 months decreased the risk of relapse by 85%. In our study, we could validate several risk factors affecting survival and duration of patients who underwent AHSCT. However, that ıs necessary to expand the sample group of the studies and extend the follow-up period for more meaningful results.

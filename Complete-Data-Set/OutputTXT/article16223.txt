Makale Başlığı: Some Services to Be Provided and Technologies to Be Used for UAS Traffic Management (UTM) in Urban Airspace
Özet: In addition to being preferred for entertainment and hobby purposes, unmanned aerial vehicles have begun to be used effectively in agricultural activities, security surveillance, search and rescue activities and many other areas. The developments have been experienced so far attracted the attention of many other sectors, especially the transportation and aviation sector. As a part of our daily life in the future, drones, autonomous air vehicles, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), and personal air vehicles (PAV, DPAV) that some are still concept technologies will create a serious urban air mobility (UAM) over and around settlements where people live. It is of great importance that this mobility, which will take place in the urban airspace, is managed in harmony with the existing air traffic management (ATM). Unmanned aircraft systems traffic management (UTM) needs are different from ATM. However, solutions for UTM can be offered by using new technologies together with existing technologies. In this study, it has been tried to create a basic model for urban air mobility system infrastructure by suggesting some services that should be provided and technologies that can be used for the safe and regular traffic management of unmanned aerial vehicles that will use the urban airspace.

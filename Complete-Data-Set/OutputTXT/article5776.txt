Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Research on Two Art Associations: “Helikon Association” in Turkey And “Khorus Jangi Association” in Iran
Özet: In this article, the ideas and activities of the Helikon Association in Turkey and the Khorus Jangi Association in Iran, which had a strong impact on the modern art of the neighboring countries Iran and Turkey, will be compared and their impact on the tendency of Turkish and Iranian artists to avant-garde art will be discussed. These two art associations were established in the 1950s by like-minded friends from various branches of art and literature. Specialists from the plastic arts, poetry and literature, music, cinema, and theater came together in these associations to share and discuss the new movements and ideas emerging in these branches around the world. Since most of the members of the Helikon Association are musicians, this association is mostly known for music, whereas painting and poetry predominate in the Khorus Jangi Association. The aims of these associations are presented by their founders as introducing the art of the day to the public and to increase their knowledge on this subject. They were short-lived, and both were closed down by the state because of the political conditions of that time due to false reports and conflicts.

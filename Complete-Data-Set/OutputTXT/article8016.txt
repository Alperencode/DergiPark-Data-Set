Makale Başlığı: Planning Process of Mogan Lake Environment
Özet: Climatic items are the inanimate elements of the natural environment, together with the mountains, seas, forests, and lakes that are the structure of the earth. Besides, humans, vegetation, animal communities, and micro-organisms are accepted as the living elements of the environment. As an inanimate natural entity in Ankara, Mogan Lake also provides living people to relax by being in its natural environment and ensures the continuity of the ecological balance. The building construction around Mogan Lake has increased and intensified since 1920. Afterward, Gölbaşı District has faced a rapidly increasing immigration and population since the 1950s. Hence, the unplanned construction continued until the declaration of Gölbaşı and its surroundings as a Special Environmental Protection Area. The lakes of Mogan and Eymir were discussed together, for the first time, in the Environmental Plan prepared by the Special Environmental Protection Agency, although they were assessed separately in the previous plans. Therefore, in this article, the planning process of Mogan Lake and its surroundings, where construction is increasingly intensified, has been discussed, while trying to provide data for the planning studies to be carried out with the aim of protecting Mogan and Eymir Lakes in the same basin.

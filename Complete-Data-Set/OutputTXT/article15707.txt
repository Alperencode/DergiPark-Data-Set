Makale Başlığı: The Konya Basin Metallic Ware: Typological, Technological and Chronological Analysis of a Specialized Early Bronze Age Ceramic Production in Anatolia
Özet: This paper provides a synthetic assessment of a peculiar Early Bronze Age ceramic production from the Konya Basin in southern-central Anatolia (Turkey), known in the literature as “Metallic Ware”. While there have been several studies on this ware, our work presents for the first time a detailed chrono-typology, a functional analysis and an evaluation of its spatial distribution employing ca 340 published and unpublished pieces. We also propose a new term to identify this production in future studies, the “Konya Basin Metallic Ware (KBMW)”.

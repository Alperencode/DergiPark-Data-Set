Makale Başlığı: The EU-Turkey refugee deal of autumn 2015 as a two-level game
Özet: The Syrian refugee crisis has put EU-Turkeyrelations under pressure for action, as in 2015 hundreds of thousands used theTurkey-Balkan route to enter Western Europe. Against this background, thearticle aims to analyse the EU-Turkey negotiations of autumn 2015 as a‘two-level game’, focussing especially on domestic factors in Turkey and Germanyand their possible impact on their governments bargaining power. Specificdomestic factors such as the controversial ‘open-doors policy’ of chancellorMerkel as well as the hung parliament in Turkey after the June elections aretaken into consideration. The article then applies the basic logic of ‘twolevel games’ as introduced by Robert Putnam on the EU/German-Turkishnegotiations leading up to the ‘refugee deal’ (EU action plan) of November 2015.Among others, it turned out that significant veto powers in both countries werenot in sight and that a non-agreement would have raised the political costs forthe EU side more than for Turkey, thus pointing at an asymmetrical distributionof bargaining power in favour of Turkey.

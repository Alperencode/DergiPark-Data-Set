Makale Başlığı: Determination of Entomopathogenic Nematode Persistency with Surface Spraying and Soil Injection Applications in a Peach Orchard
Özet: Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are effective biological control agents against underground and cryptic pests. Persistency and survival of EPN in soil after soil application is important for long term success of management programs. In this study, it was aimed to determine the soil persistency of 4 native EPN species after surface spraying and soil injection applications in a peach orchard. In the study, S. feltiae (96), S. carpocapsae 1133, H. bacteriophora 1144 and S. affine 47 species were applied in 30 l water with 140.000 IJ/tree dose per tree by surface spraying and soil injection methods. EPN were applied to soil with a watering can in surface spraying method and with a pulverizator into 5-15 cm depth in soil injection method. After the monthly application, soil samples were collected and EPN presence was tested with G. mellonella larvae and White traps in the laboratory. The study was conducted for 2 times in 2018 and 2019. At the end of the study, EPN persistency in soil was found to be 90 days in 2018 and 150 days in 2019.

Makale Başlığı: SHEİKH MAHMUT BERZINCI'S FIGHT WITH IMPERIALISM
Özet: While the imperialists were reshaping the Middle East Geography, they first made some promises to the people living in the region, and when they achieved their goals, they turned their backs on the mentioned nations and ethnic groups. With the British occupation of Iraq in the First World War, the peoples in Iraq got their share of these promises. The British also had a dualist policy towards the Kurds. In this sense, Sheikh Mahmut Berzinci, who lived in Sulaymaniyah against the dualist policies pursued by the British during the First World War invading Iraq, started a revolt in 1919. Sheikh Mahmud's aim was to give the Iraqi Kurds an independent status without falling under the domination of the British and Arabs.  In this article, the Sheikh Mahmut Berzinci movement, which started in 1919 and continued until 1932, was tried to be explained based on historical information. The study is a qualitative research based on literature reading. With this study, which was compiled from various books, journals, theses and articles, the reasons and results of the Sheikh Mahmut movement were tried to be explained. The reason that makes this research important is to integrate the fragmented data from different sources about the Sheikh Mahmut movement. Volumes of books have been written on the Sheikh's movement, and in this article, only a brief summary of the aforementioned studies has been tried to be given.

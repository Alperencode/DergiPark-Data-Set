Makale Başlığı: A new Biosensor Development Pencil on Based Graphite Electrode-Ascorbate Oxidase for Dtermination of L-ascorbic acid (C Vitamin)
Özet: In this study, in respect to provide an novel and inventive viewpoint, a new assay for analysis of L-ascorbic acid was enhanced using PGE. Ascorbat oxidase was crosswise bounded using gluteraldehyde and gelatine, stable to the surface of pencil graphite electrode and devised biosensor was used for the detection of ascorbic acid. L-ascorbic acid measuring were done amperometrically at -0.7 V using the improved biosensor. For the PGE/gelatine- glutaraldehyde /ascorbate oxidase biosensor ascorbate oxidase concentration, holding time in glutaradehyde, gelatine amount and glutaraldehyde stratifying repat cycle were determined to be 1.5 U/mL, 3minutes, 20 mg and 3 times stratification in turn after optimization works. Potassium phosphate buffer (pH:7, 50 mM) and 30ºC warmth determined to procure optimum labouring conditions. After the characterization labours, 25 µM - 500 µM detection space was provide to be linear for PGE/gelatine- glutaraldehyde/ascorbate oxidase biosensor. Regarding the results, the % coefficient of variation (V.K) = 0.44 and the standard deviation (S.S) = ±1.46 µM. As a result of the experiments on storage stability, it was determined that 75% activity was preserved at the end of the 4-week period.

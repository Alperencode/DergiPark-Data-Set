Makale Başlığı: An Examination of School Principals' Views on Financial Sustainability of Primary Schools Using Delphi Technique
Özet: The need for a sustainable financing system for schools in Turkey is increasing day by day due to the increase in costs. This study, which was carried out with a phenomenological design, aims to take the opinions of school principals working in public primary schools on the financial sustainability of schools by using the Delphi technique. In the research process, to ensure that schools can be managed financially better, first of all, the suggestions and opinions of the school principals were taken, and then the second application was made and the collected suggestions were presented to the participating school principals for approval. Then, the statistical values of the answers obtained were examined and the items on which they were compromised were determined. In this direction, according to the results obtained in the research, the participant school principals suggested realizing the employment of school assistants and servants at the ministry level, transitioning to a school-based budget system with the financial support to be provided to schools by taking into account various conditions (such as the number of students, socio-economic status, number of branches, physical equipment), making local governments more effective in financing education and the fact that they allocate budgets, providing convenience by tax exemptions for school-related expenditures or tax or SSI (the Turkish Social Security Institution) reduction in personnel employment, the ministry’s employment of personnel in technical, maintenance, and repair works of schools, receiving fees from the parents of students during registration for schools to earn financial income, and appropriating central allowance by analyzing the needs of the schools.

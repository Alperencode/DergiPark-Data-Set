Makale Başlığı: Physical-Mechanical Parameters of Hazelnut Husk Bio-Briquettes Produced by a Horizontal Pressing Briquetting Machine
Özet: Türkiye has a big potential of hazelnut residues, especially the husks that is not used for any purposes. It is estimated that 200.000 tons of husk residue is produced per year after hazelnut harvesting. Biomass became very popular since it is alternative source of energy and provides employment facilities in rural areas. Briquetting is the most widely used waste compaction technology. A hydraulic type briquetting machine with horizontal course was manufactured to convert this particular idle residue into biofuels. Some physical and mechanical properties of briquettes produced under different pressures with different particle sizes and having differ-ent moisture contents were determined.

Makale Başlığı: ORGANIZATIONAL ETHICAL CLIMATE: A SCALE DEVELOPMENT STUDY
Özet: In this study, an "Organizational Ethical Climate" is used to determine the organizational ethical climate practices in businesses/institutions operating in all sectors, based on the sectors where the organizational ethical climate is considered important, and to measure it with a measurement tool with high validity and reliability based on scientific methods. It is aimed to develop the “Scale”. The study was conducted with the data obtained from three different sample groups: Universities and health and industry sectors. As a data collection tool, a draft scale consisting of 9 items prepared in the form of a 5-point Likert scale was used by the study group in line with the literature. The data were analyzed with a package program. EFA and CFA were performed in line with validity and reliability studies. According to the results of the analysis, the “Organizational Ethical Climate Scale” consisted of two sub-dimensions and 9 items. In addition, as a result of the reliability analysis, it was determined that the scale was highly reliable. It is considered that the Organizational Ethical Climate Scale, with its two-dimensional structure called ethical climate for rules and ethical climate for behaviors, will fill a gap in the field by meeting an important need for determining and measuring organizational ethical climate in future studies.

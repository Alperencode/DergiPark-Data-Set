Makale Başlığı: The Concept of "Salâm" in The Qur’an in The Context of Relationship with The Other
Özet: The issue of communication with members of different faiths is an issue that preserves its importance today as it was in the past. With globaliza-tion, communication/transport opportunities have increased, and this has brought the relationship between religions to the fore. At this point, the communication of Islam with the other, especially for members of different faiths, comes to the fore on various occasions. The basic princi-ples of the Qur'an in communicating with members of different faiths; It is based on recognizing the existence of the other and preparing the ground for coexistence with them, where respect and goodness are essen-tial. In cases where this ground does not exist, Allah has given permis-sion to fight the opposing side, while remaining faithful to the virtues that make a Muslim a Muslim. What Allah wants from believers, wheth-er in peace or in war, is to behave in a manner befitting the righteous believers of the Rahman. In our opinion, one of these behaviors is the attitude of saying 'salam' when members of different faiths insult believ-ers. This attitude is an important guide for healthy communication with the other, especially for members of different faiths.

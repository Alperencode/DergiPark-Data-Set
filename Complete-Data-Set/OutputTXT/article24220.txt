Makale Başlığı: Midterm Outcomes of High-flexion Total Knee Arthroplasty on Japanese Lifestyle
Özet: Objectives: To evaluate the clinical outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using the Genesis II posterior stabilized prosthesis with a high-flex insert during the mid-term follow-up and to assess its effect on the Japanese lifestyle. Materials and Methods: Fifty-three consecutive patients (8 men and 45 women) underwent primary TKA. The mean follow-up duration was 76 months (5-9 years). We evaluated the Japanese Orthopedic Association osteoarthritis knee rating score (JOA knee score), range of motion, and lifestyle changes. Results: The postoperative JOA knee score improved significantly compared to the preoperative JOA knee score. The mean preoperative flexion range improved from 112° to 123° postoperatively. Additionally, our findings showed that 39% of patients enjoyed a floor-sitting life preoperatively, but only 30% of patients enjoyed floor-sitting life postoperatively. Conclusion: The postoperative range of knee motion and JOA knee score improved after TKA using the Genesis II posterior stabilized prosthesis with a high-flex insert, but the number of patients who enjoyed floor-sitting life decreased from 39% to 30% because of feelings of fear and discomfort. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0357This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

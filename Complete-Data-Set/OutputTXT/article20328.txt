Makale Başlığı: History Teaching in 3 Dimensional Virtual Environments:  Systematic Review
Özet: This study aims to reveal the current status of the studies related to teaching history in 3D virtual environments and the contribution of such environments to teaching history. Systematic review method was used in the study. The studies on history teaching in 3D virtual environments, which were conducted between the years 2000-2020, were reviewed in various databases by the use of Turkish and English keywords “3D virtual world”, “3D virtual environment”, “history education / classroom / history teaching or history of teaching”, “3D virtual history education”, and “historical revival”, and they were excluded or included after their content were studied. As a result; 6 full-text conference papers, 7 articles, and 1 thesis were detected. While it was seen that a historical environment was designed in all studies, it was observed in the majority of the studies that the characters in period clothing were also depicted reenacting a historical context as well as the historical environment design. During history teaching in 3D virtual environments, positive results were obtained when the variables such as satisfaction related to the environment design and students' success were studied. Moreover, it was detected that the meticulously selected team members and teaching practices should be included in a decent plan and conducted accordingly. As a result of the study, recommendations for prospective studies related to history teaching in 3D virtual environments were made.

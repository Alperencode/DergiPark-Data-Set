Makale Başlığı: Effects of Roasting Process on Color and Some Industrial Properties of Hazelnuts Cultivated By Organic And Conventional Methods
Özet: In this study, the effects of the roasting process on the color (L- value, a-value, b-value, hue, chroma, total color difference- ΔE and browning index- BI) and some technological properties (blanching percentage and full blanching percentage) of cultured hazelnuts cultivated by organic and conventional methods was investigated. The study material was collected from Turkey, the world’s most important hazelnut cultivation center, and Tombul, Mincane, Çakıldak, Palaz, Foşa and Sivri cultivars that have commercial importance were selected. The roasting conditions were set at 130 °C for 40 minutes and 160 °C for 20 minutes, the most preferred conditions in the industry. The results of the study demonstrated that blanching and full blanching percentages of organic hazelnuts were high at low temperatures and the BI values of it were high at both temperatures. Tombul and Mincane cultivars came to the forefront with their blanching performance. With the increase in temperature, L and hue value decreased and a, b and chroma values increased. However, it was determined that the cultivation method and the cultivar factor did not affect these values. Considering these results, organic hazelnuts were found to be more sensitive to heat treatment. Therefore, we recommend roasting organic hazelnuts at a lower temperature than conventional method.

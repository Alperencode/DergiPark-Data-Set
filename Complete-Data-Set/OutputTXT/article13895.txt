Makale Başlığı: WATER CULT IN TUNCELİ THROUGH EXAMPLES OF MUNZUR AND ANA FATMA
Özet: The water cult, which has a long history in Tunceli folk belief, is an important example of the traces of past beliefs living in the region. The water cult, which was carried to Anatolia from ancient Turkish beliefs and blended with the ancient beliefs here, manifests itself in many sacred places and rituals in the region. The study we conducted in this direction reveals how the water cult gained a new meaning from the Alevi/Kizilbash belief by examining the local sacred places Munzur Springs and the river and Ana Fatma holy places. The water cult within these two sacred places in the region was tried to be enlightened. For this purpose, in our study, firstly, the existing water cult in the old Turks was examined, then the water cult in the Tunceli region was mentioned in general terms. Finally, the holy places of Munzur and Ana Fatma, the water cult and other related cults in these holy places are discussed. It has been determined that the existing water possessor in the old Turks gained a new meaning in Tunceli through Munzur and Ana Fatma. The reflections of the rituals in the old Turkish belief world in Tunceli, such as the sacrifice, hair and kindling rituals performed by the river, have been determined. In this sense, the religious and cultural reflections in question have been tried to be explained together with historical data.

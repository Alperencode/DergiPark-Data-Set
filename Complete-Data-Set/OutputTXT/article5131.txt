Özet: The relevance of reverse logistics is increasing day by day as a result of the recycling of used goods, which is required for environmental reasons and seen as a competitive advantage by enterprises. The profitability of enterprises increases and their image in the eyes of consumers improves as a result of changes achieved in reverse logistics systems.

Choosing an inappropriate 3PRLP for a firm will diminish resource efficiency, increase operational hazards, and potentially harm the company's long-term growth. As a result, proper 3PRLP evaluation and selection may entail a variety of criteria, group decision-making, and diverse levels of uncertainty.

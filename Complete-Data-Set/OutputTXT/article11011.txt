Makale Başlığı: Cooperatives and Municipalities in the Context of Local Development Interactions
Özet: Today, cooperatives emerge as the most serious alternative for the poor and vulnerable majority to survive against globalization and the resulting inequalities and economic crises. Cooperatives are not only contemporary organizational structures. It has also been the best example of solidarity within the capitalist system from time immemorial. Today, the importance of cooperatives as an alternative economic organization is increasing. It is not possible for local development to be successful only with the unilateral efforts of the public authorities in the target region. Local development also requires mutual interaction and solidarity among actors. Cooperatives, by their nature, are cooperative and participatory. Therefore, it is an inevitable necessity for municipalities, which are local public authorities, to cooperate with local cooperatives in the development process. The emergence of the local and regional development impact expected from cooperatives depends on the support they will receive from the civil society and local governments in the places where they are established. In this context, the municipality-cooperative relations developed by the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality in Turkey are an exemplary model for the rest of Turkey. In this study, a comprehensive assessment is made on how an interaction model that can create mutual synergy between municipalities and cooperatives should be constructed in order to ensure local and regional development, and the municipality-cooperative relations that are successful in terms of local development in Turkey are discussed.

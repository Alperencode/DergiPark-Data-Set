Makale Başlığı: Workplace Flexibility and Organizational Commitment: The Mediator Role of Psychological Contract
Özet: In this study, the mediator role of the psychological contract on the effect of workplace flexibility on organizational commitment was examined. The sample of the research consists of 112 participants working in different sectors and positions in Istanbul. To test the research hypotheses, Simple Regression Analysis and Hierarchical Regression Analysis were performed. As a result of the analyses, the full mediator role of the relational psychological contract and the partial mediator role of the transactional psychological contract on the relationship between workplace flexibility and affective commitment and normative commitment were determined. With the inclusion of continuance commitment in the analysis as a dependent variable, the mediating role of both types of psychological contracts did not occur. Organizations can influence their employees’ psychological contracts and increase their commitment to the organization by providing flexibility in the work environment. There is a limited number of national studies in which employees’ perceptions of flexible practices in the workplace are considered. Also, it is predicted that examining flexibility within the scope of different models will contribute to the field.

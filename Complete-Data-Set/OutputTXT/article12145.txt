Makale Başlığı: Comparison of mild and moderate aortic stenosis severity with global left ventricular load index, contractility reserve and heart rate recovery time
Özet: Objective: Aortic stenosis is the most common heart valve disease. Patients are symptomatic and life expectancy is shortened in cases where valve surgery cannot be performed. It is important to detect patients in the asymptomatic period. Aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between heart rate recovery time, contractility reserve and global left ventricular volume loading index parameters, which have been studied before in severe aortic stenosis, with aortic valve severity in patients with asymptomatic mild and moderate aortic stenosis.Method: 36 and 24 patients with mild and moderate aortic stenosis were included in the study respectively. The patients’ heart rate recovery time, contractility reserve and global left ventricular volume load index were calculated and the difference between the values found and the number of patients was evaluated statistically.Results: A significant difference was found between the mean contractility reserve (5.31±1.21 vs 3.87±1.06%, respectively, p<0.05), and between the mean global left ventricular load index (3.08±0.42 vs 5.59±0.63 mmHg/ml/m2, respectively, p<0.05), and between the mean heart rate recovery time in the first minute in patients with mild and moderate aortic stenosis (19.9±13.8 vs. 26.8±7.3 beats/min, p<0.05, respectively).Conclusion: It may be necessary to examine more frequently the patients whose global left ventricular load index, contractility reserve and heart rate recovery time are not normal during a period when patients are asymptomatic.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECTS OF SHOE SUITABILITY ON PLANTAR PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION AND BALANCE PARAMETERS IN CHILDREN WITH HEARING IMPAIRMENT
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the characteristics of the shoes used by the children have an effect on the dynamic and static plantar pressure distribution parameters and balance parameters in hearing impaired children, and to compare the results with those of nonhearing- impaired children.Methods: The study included 136 children, 68 children with hearing impairment and 68 children without hearing impairment. The Footwear Assessment Score (FAS) was applied to evaluate children's footwear. Flamingo Balance Test (FBT) was used to evaluate the static balance of the children, and the Functional Reach Test (FRT) was used to evaluate the dynamic balance of the children. Static and dynamic plantar pressure distribution measurements of the children were carried out with a sensored walking platform (Footscan® pedobarography system (RsScan-FootScan lab ltd., Ipswich, England)).Results: In hearing impaired children, a positive relationship was found between FAS and dominant foot total percentage of pressure values. In children without hearing impairment, there was a negative relationship between FAS and dominant hindfoot pressure, and a positive relationship between FAS and anterior non-dominant foot pressure (p<0.05). There was no significant relationship of FAS with balance tests, dynamic plantar pressure values, and walking parameters in both groups (p>0.05).Conclusions: The increase in static loading with the footwear suitability on the dominant foot in hearing impaired children may be an indication that children with balance problems load more on the dominant foot in order to feel safer.

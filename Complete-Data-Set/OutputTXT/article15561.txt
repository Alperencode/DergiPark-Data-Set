Makale Başlığı: Physical match performance and creatine kinase levels in elite football players
Özet: Many studies have shown that creatine kinase (CK) concentration increases following an elite-level football competition. However, the relationship between match performance and CK levels at 72 hours after the match is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between physical match performance data and blood CK levels 72 hours post-match in elite football players. The study included 11 male elite football players (age=26.36±3.29 years, height=181.60±6.1 cm, weight=75.41±5.96 kg). Capillary blood samples were collected from the participants approximately 72 hours post-match and examined by reflectance photometry. Physical match performance data from 2 consecutive matches of a Turkish Super League team (while competing in the UEFA Europa League) were collected by a computerized video tracking system. There was no significant correlation between the players’ CK level and their total distance (p=0.6012), high-intensity (20-24 km/h) running distance (p=0.8837), or sprinting distance (p=0.235). CK level was also not correlated with the percentage of total distance covered in high-intensity running (r=-0.62, p=0.052). However, moderate to strong negative correlations were observed between CK level and percentage of total distance covered in sprinting (r=-0.67, p=0.032) and percentage of total distance covered in high-intensity running and sprinting (r=-0.70, p=0.022). The current study suggests the benefit of evaluating distances covered in the game and CK concentrations 72 hours post-match while planning recovery interventions.

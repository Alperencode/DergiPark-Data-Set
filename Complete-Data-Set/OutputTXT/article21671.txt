Makale Başlığı: Pre-Service Social Studies Teacher’s Perceptions on Scientific Literacy
Özet: With the arrangements made in the curriculums in 2018, raising individuals who will have a say in science and technology has been determined as the main goal. This study explores the pre-service social studies teachers’ views on scientific literacy. The study was carried out using descriptive survey model. Convenience sampling method was used to determine the study group. The data were derived from 743 social studies teacher candidates in the study group.  The data of the study were collected through an interview form consisting of five open-ended questions developed by the researcher.  Content analysis was used for data analysis. The results of the study show that social studies teacher candidates’ perception of scientific literacy is that they generally define scientific literacy but treat it as one-dimensional, and they have also misconceptions that it is related to the social sciences and should not be separated from the social sciences; it is related to the social studies lesson as it consists of the contents of the social sciences and that many social sciences use scientific research methods just like science and mathematics. It was determined that they stated that the use of scientific literacy topics in the social studies lesson will make a positive contribution, but it may differ according to the class level and conditions.

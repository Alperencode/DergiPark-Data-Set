Makale Başlığı: A Sustainability Review of Industrial Building Design in Turkey and a Model Proposal for Industrial Zones
Özet: Results of the sustainability studies on the built environment field are mainly; ecological design, sustainable architecture, green buildings, building evaluation systems. On the other hand, efforts on sustainable industry have turned out some non-traditional concepts like well-planned zones, industrial ecology, industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks. It is aimed to further contribute to the design and implementation of sustainable and qualified superstructure in industrial zones in Turkey by analyzing these two subjects especially focusing on their intersections. Firstly the eco-industrial park concept and newly emerged Green OIZ Project in Turkey have been studied specifically in the context of green superstructure. Secondly, industrial buildings in Turkey which are evaluated or being evaluated with a certification system are detected and their data have been compiled. The interviews with the firms that had provided consultancy services for a significant part of those buildings, have been used for the discussion and interpretation of the collected data.  At the end of the study, a model has been proposed to improve the sustainability of superstructure in industrial zones in Turkey.

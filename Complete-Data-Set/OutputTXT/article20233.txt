Makale Başlığı: The Transformation of Chinese Foreign Policy From The Beginning to The Present: Major Country Diplomacy
Özet: Since the ascension of Xi Jinping to power in 2012, massive shifts in Chinese foreign policy have emerged. Xi has replaced Deng Xiaoping’s doctrine of keeping of a low profile with his more assertive diplomatic strategy striving for achievement. However, China has never abandoned its inclusive strategy of peaceful development. At the same time, under Xi Jinping, China has formulated “Major Country Diplomacy with Chinese Characteristics” as his brand of foreign policy. Xi has also adopted the Chinese dream as part of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the world dream as part of a shared future for humankind. The objective of this study is to explore on the theory and practice of the diplomatic strategies of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping and systematize the Chinese view of their periodization and content. Thus, this study examines Xi’s major country diplomacy in the light of strategic partnerships, maritime nationalism, and the Belt and Road initiative as an inclusive development model.

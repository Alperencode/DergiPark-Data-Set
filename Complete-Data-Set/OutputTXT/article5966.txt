Totally 599 volunteer participants were involved in this study. Data from 361 participants were used for Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and data from 238 participants were used for Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Findings of EFA were demonstrated a structure with 10 factors, and factor loads of items in these factors were between .46 and .96. And CFA results displayed that the RMSEA value of the model was .063, and other goodness-of-fit indexes were among acceptable values. Also coefficients of Cronbach's Alpha were observed between .821 and .933. These findings revealed that the scale consisted of 42 items, under its 10-dimensional structure and the sports events quality variable of this structure explained a significant variance of 73.23%.

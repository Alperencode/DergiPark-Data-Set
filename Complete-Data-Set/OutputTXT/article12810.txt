Makale Başlığı: Native Language Using Patterns in Second Language Learners' Lecture Notes: A Case Study
Özet: It is an undeniable fact that notetaking is an effective strategy in second language learning. This study highlights B1 level adult ESL students' strategy of using their L1 during their notetaking in a native-speaker teacher's lectures. For this study, a combination of grades taken in B1 level English courses were collected from different participants and these grades were analyzed through thematic content analysis. Additionally, the same participants were given a semi-structured questionnaire to discuss the overall effectiveness of partial first language use in students' grades. The study findings showed that, in general, when students encounter a complex vocabulary and can immediately remember the equivalent of these words in their first language, they directly translate the foreign language word they encounter into their mother tongue. However, if they cannot remember the exact first language equivalent of the foreign word, or if the first language version is complex, or if the student is unsure, it shows that they have explained these words using their second language. These findings have significant contributions to educators and test-designers as they can develop new language teaching and assessing strategies via using L1 notetaking.

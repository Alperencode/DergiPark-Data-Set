Makale Başlığı: Cytogenetic Characteristics of Gerbillus dasyurus and Meriones tristrami (Rodentia: Gerbillinae) from Kilis, Turkey: Conventional and C Banded Karyotypes
Özet: In this study, diploid chromosome number and constitutive heterochromatin distributions of chromosomes were determined in Gerbillus dasyurus and Meriones tristrami species. The diploid chromosome numbers (2n) and autosomal chromosome arms (NFa) of G. dasyurus and M. tristrami were determined as 2n=60, NFa= 68, and 2n=72, NFa= 73, respectively. It was found that there were differences in autosomal chromosomal arms (NFa) of two different gerbil species, the karyotypes of which were obtained in this study, compared to previously conducted studies in Türkiye. Heteromorphic chromosome pair (submetacentric/acrocentric) was found in the autosomal set of M. tristrami. There was an enlarged heterochromatin block on the short arm of submetacentric chromosome in heteromorphic chromosome pair.

Makale Başlığı: EPR-based study to monitor Free Radicals in Treated Silk Fibroin with Anthocyanins
Özet: Bioactive materials of natural origin have great demand in industry and medicine due to their versatility and useful properties. The main purpose of this work is to prepare biocomposites for the dual purpose of modified silk fibroin (Bombyx mori L.), which protects against the destructive effects of bioactive, antioxidant and ultraviolet rays. For this purpose, an aqueous extract of autumn leaves of the anthocyanin-rich smoke tree plant (Cotinus coggygria L.) was applied. 2% thiourea solution was used to increase the durability of the modified SF to external influences and for use in textiles. The intensity of free radicals in silk fibroin-anthocyanin (SFA) and silk fibroin-anthocyanin-thiourea (SFAT) biocomposites modified by the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) method was studied. Maximum adsorption time was determined 20 minutes and the intensity of free radicals in SFA bio-composite was 80-85% and in SFAT biocomposite 50-55% in relation to silk fibroin untreated. For biomedical use of SFA, the radical scavenger activity kinetics were studied on a UV-2700 spectrophotometer and radical capture activity was calculated: RSA% (bioextract) = 73.52 ± 0.5, RSA% (SF) = 6.42 ± 0.4, RSA% (SFA) = 45.23 ± 0.8

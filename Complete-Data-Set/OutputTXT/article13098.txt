Makale Başlığı: Synthesis and Characterization of Copper Metal  Matrix Composite Reinforced with Ceramic Oxide Extracted By The Green Route
Özet: The paper presents the synthesis and characterization of Copper metal matrix composite reinforced with silica using powder metallurgy route. The 5%wt of silica is reinforced with copper metal as matrix material. 5% wt Magnesium was added as wetting agent as copper shows poor wettability towards silica.  The reinforced silica was extracted from agro waste rice husk ash under controlled conditions of sintering temperature and duration of heating from rice husk ash using alkali extraction method. Reflux method was used to extract nanosilica from silica. Silica and the composite were characterized for microstructural studies, elemental composition and surface morphologies using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The synthesized copper silica composite was studied for structural, compositional and mechanical properties. The results showed that the copper metal matrix composite reinforced with silica showed improved mechanical behavior and can be used in all such applications where light weight and better mechanical strength from copper metal are expected. As the filler material silica is extracted from green route which partially replaces the expensive metal, this work reports a non-toxic, cost effective, light weight and improved mechanical strength substitute for copper metal applications.

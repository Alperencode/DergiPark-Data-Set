Makale Başlığı: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENTREPRENEUR'S PERSPECTIVE FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS
Özet: It is very difficult for public administrators to get results by using only public policies in solving public problems. With the effects of changing social structure, developing technology and globalization, the diversity of public problems has increased and their contents have become different. For this reason, the implementation of public policies alone is no longer sufficient to solve public problems. Effective solutions to many problems can be found thanks to examples of successful entrepreneurship applied in solving social problems. Entrepreneurship has become an important management tool for public administrators in solving the issues where public policies are insufficient. The success in public administration practices of public entrepreneurship which are among the types of entrepreneurship and whose examples are increasing in the public sector is directly proportional to the presence of managers who will support these activities. In the study, the role of public administrators in public entrepreneurship, who is often seen as an obstacle to change in public institutions and who do not want to take risks due to future concerns, has been tried to be evaluated.

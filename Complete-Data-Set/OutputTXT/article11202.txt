Makale Başlığı: Microplastic Occurrence in the Gill and Gastrointestinal Tract of Chelon ramada (Mugilidae) in a Highly Urbanized Region, İskenderun Bay, Türkiye
Özet: Microplastic pollution in marine ecosystems has become a significant, global concern which attracting the attention of academics and policy makers. This study provides information regarding the microplastic occurrence in the gill and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of Chelon ramada (Risso, 1827). A total of 158 MPs were extracted from the gill and GIT with a mean of 1.9±1.8 particle/individual in gill and 3.4±2.1 particle/individual in GIT. Fiber was the most commonly extracted microplastic type (79%), followed by fragments (16%), film (4%) and pellet (2%). Mean size of extracted MPs from the organs of Chelon ramada was found as 1251±1602 µm. Black, transparent, red and blue MPs were extracted from the organs and dominance of black and transparent MPs were observed in the gill and GIT, respectively. This study is providing the first data regarding the microplastic ingestion of Chelon ramada and the results obtained in this will help to understand the relationship between anthropogenic influences and microplastic ingestion.

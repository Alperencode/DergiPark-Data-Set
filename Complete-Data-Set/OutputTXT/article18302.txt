Makale Başlığı: ASYMMETRICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXCHANGE RATE AND STOCK MARKET IN TURKEY
Özet: One of the main objectives of the macroeconomic policies of the countries is to ensure balanced and sustainable growth. Globally, the mobility of capital in financial markets is increasing and the role of financial markets in ensuring macroeconomic stability has become more important in recent years. This study aims to empirically examine the relationship between exchange rate and stock market after financial liberalization in Turkey. In this context, the relationship between BIST-100, Bist Industrial, Bist Technology, Bist Service and Bist Fiscal indices and the reel and nominal exchange rate is analyzed using monthly data for the period 2002-2020. Hacker and Hatemi-J (2012) and Hatemi-J (2012) tests are used to detect symmetrical or asymmetrical relationships between variables. Findings from symmetric tests indicate that there is causality only from stock markets to both nominal and real exchange rates. However, when we take asymmetric tests into account, there is evidence that the causal relationship from stocks to nominal exchange rates may be asymmetric. In addition, it is concluded that there may be a relationship from exchange rate to stock prices and this relationship is asymmetrical. Therefore, when designing exchange rate policies, policy makers should take into account the possible differential effects of this asymmetrical relationship on capital flows.

Makale Başlığı: Precarious Work in Turkish Basketball Leagues
Özet: Precarious work is not limited to certain professions or market sectors but involves  many  fields  of  work.  One  such  area  is  a  professional  sport  that  has  become  an  economic  field  of  work  on  a  global  scale.  It  has  done  so  by  becoming  more  professional  since  the  1980s.  In  the  Global  Dialogue  Forum  titled  Decent  Work  in  the  World  of  Sports  organized  in  2020,  the  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  highlighted  the  problems of  precarious  work  in  professional  sports.  It  emphasized  the  necessity  of  regulations  to  be  implemented  in  line with the solution of the problems. In this study, the author aimed to shed light on the regulations to be promulgated  regarding  the  problems  by  demonstrating  the  problems  of  precarious  working  in  professional  sports determined by the ILO (2020) in Turkish Basketball Leagues from the perspective of basketball players employed  by  sports  clubs.  In  this  effort,  the  author  employed  a  semi-structured  interview  technique,  one  of  the  data  collection  types  of  qualitative  research  method,  with  ten  professional  basketball  players  employed  by  sports  clubs  in  Turkish  Basketball  Leagues  and  benefited  from  the  audio  and  visual  materials  related  to  the  problems  provided  by  basketball  players  in  the  interviews.  Findings  were  reached  by  interpreting  and  summarizing the data obtained through descriptive analysis. In this context, the precarious working problems of basketball players in Turkish Basketball Leagues have given rise to wage disparities, disability and incapacity issues, unregistered and uncompensated work, occupational health and safety problems, weekend vacation, psychological  harassment,  discrimination,  physical  violence,  union  representation,  education,  uncertainty  about the future, and problems related to the Covid-19 process.

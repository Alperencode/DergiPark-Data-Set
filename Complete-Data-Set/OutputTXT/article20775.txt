Makale Başlığı: An Untapped Definition of The State: The Virtual State and Example of Qatar
Özet: The facet of territorial and military ambitions began to lose its importance with the states starting to specialize in high value-added and intangible assets. Richard Rosecrance endeavored to formulate a novel development method for these relatively small-scale states. Instead of developing an immense domestic manufacturing capacity with traditional production methods, these 'virtual' states have followed a knowledge, artificial intelligence, and innovation-based development that emphasizes investment, high added value, and the mobility of intangible assets. Although some states did not wholly fit into the virtual state framework within the scope of Rosecrance's definition, they carried some of its characteristics. This study claims that Qatar, which has succeeded in establishing a sphere of influence beyond its borders and population, has some virtual state characteristics by merging its rich hydrocarbon resources with technology and innovation. After a theoretical review, the study claims that Qatar's virtual state characteristics have considerably mitigated the deleterious effects of the embargo imposed on Qatar by four Arab countries in 2017. The final part expands the Qatar-Turkey relationship that comes to the forefront as the field of applying these characteristics from an economic and financial perspective, contrary to the prevailing ideology and politics-based studies in the literature.

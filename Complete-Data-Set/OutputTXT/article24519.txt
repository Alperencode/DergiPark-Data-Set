Özet: Theworld we live in today, has become more complex and more connected than everbefore, and this growing complexity and interconnectivity is largely madepossible by the forces of modern information, communications and transportationtechnologies. The world has become a global village mainly because of therapidity in which socio-economic cleavages are getting interconnected,computers as well as other powerful devices and machines have connected peopleacross oceans. Millions of people all over the world have now become “netizens,”a new word coined to denote internet inhabitants. The use of ICTs, and theInternet, has undoubtedly become a matter of strategic importance. Africa’ssocio- economic political development can be attributed to informationcommunication technology and the “internet of things “(IOT).In as much theinternet has been a great pivot and an appetitive drive of all aspects of humanlife and endeavour, it equally comes with its own associated difficulties,challenges and powerful threats not to only national security but humansurvival at large.Thispaper seeks to critically discuss cyber security in Africa and its accompaniedchallenges and problems. It further discusses the commanding threats cyberinsecurity poses to the Africa as a continent. Relevant analysis is  made in other to bring to fore the direconsequences  the lack of cyber securitymechanism subject  a country like Africa,and further plausibly    explained  the need to protect and guide desirously theinternet space of Africa since it is exposed to hazards of many kind.

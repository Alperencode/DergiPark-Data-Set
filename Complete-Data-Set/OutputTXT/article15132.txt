Makale Başlığı: Sustainable Supply Chains for Bioeconomy: A Survey on Projects and Literature on Agro-Biomass
Özet: Bioeconomy, which is based on the replacement of materials and energy production based on fossil resources with biomaterials and/or biofuels or energy generation from biomass resources, has an important place in the circular economy. Sustainable supply chains are essential to meet bioeconomy’s full potential. This study aimed to provide a theoretical framework to make use of the untapped biomass potential in Turkey. Study focused on the literature fit for purpose for the further studies to be executed for building a holistic approach on developing biomass and bioenergy projects, alternative concepts and business models utilizing agro-biomass resources and developing a conceptual framework for sustainable supply chains for a circular bioeconomy. Research clearly shows that many projects are executed within the scope of bioeconomy in Europe, mostly with a collaborative sense, and are supported by funding mechanisms in line with EU policies. In Turkey, more regulatory policies should be developed, awareness should be raised, and application-oriented innovation projects should be developed, involving all sector stakeholders.

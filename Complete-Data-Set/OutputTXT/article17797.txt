Makale Başlığı: Dynamic Simulation of a Reactive Distillation Column for Ethyl Acetate Production: Optimization of Operating Conditions Using Response Surface Methodology
Özet: In this study, we aimed to determine the optimum operating conditions for the production of ethyl acetate (EtAc) through the esterification of ethanol (EtOH) with acetic acid (HAc) in a reactive distillation (RD) column. For this, the designed column was simulated for the production of EtAc. HAc flow rate, EtOH flow rate, HAc feed stage, EtOH feed stage, reflux ratio, and reactive feed temperatures were changed and the effects of these parameters on EtAc production were observed. Central Composite Design was employed to define the optimum operating conditions for the RD column. The determination coefficient R2 was equal to 0.9197 suggesting a good relationship between the predicted and simulated responses. Adjusted R2 and predicted R2 values obtained from the program were 0.8823 and 0.7956, respectively. The optimal conditions for the EtAc production response were HAc flow rate of 120.00 kmol/h, EtOH flow rate of 150.00 kmol/h, HAc feed stage 6, EtOH feed stage 14, reflux ratio 2.2, and feed temperature 70.28 °C, which were designated by the maximum desirability function.

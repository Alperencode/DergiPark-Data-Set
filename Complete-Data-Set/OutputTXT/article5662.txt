Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Nature and the Human from Mythology to Philosophy
Özet: In the historical process, man has always taken nature as a reference point both about himself and the reality surrounding him. Nature as a reference point has been perceived in different ways from the first existence of man to the present in this process. Accordingly, in nature, which is sometimes seen as a tangible, metaphysical and sometimes dualistic reality, human beings have positioned themselves in different ways against nature. In the early days, man, who did not have enough knowledge about the fact surrounding him, respected nature and saw it as a necessity to be in harmony with nature, which he saw as a part of himself. This point of view, caused by seeing nature as a mystical reality, has changed over time with the increasing knowledge of nature and itself. Seeing the ever-increasing accumulation of knowledge as enlightenment, man has reduced nature to material reality. This has caused people, as rational beings, to see nature as a necessary resource to realize their ideals. In this study, in which the intellectual roots of the changing the relationship between nature and the human in ancient Greece and Rome are tried to be revealed in the historical process, antiquity is evaluated as a fragment of the history of thought in particular.

Makale Başlığı: An overview of rice production in Kyrgyzstan
Özet: Rice is among the most valuable food products globally, grown on all continents except Antarctica. It ranks second after wheat in terms of planted area globally but is approximately equal to wheat for grain harvest. Although Kyrgyzstan is not among the leading countries in terms of paddy cultivation and only local production is carried out in this region. Since the southern region of Kyrgyzstan is suitable for paddy farming, paddy cultivation areas and consumption have increased relatively in the last 10 years. The increase in the interest in paddy is caused by many factors such as population growth, economic return, and export to other countries. The main paddy fields in Kyrgyzstan are located in Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Batken regions. Uzgen and Ak-Turpak paddy are much superior to other varieties in terms of taste. According to studies, they contain many elements that are beneficial for humans, and the protein content is much richer than other paddy types according to World standards. In this study, the importance of Uzgen and Ak-Turpak paddy has been revealed along with the general characteristics of paddy farming in Kyrgyzstan.

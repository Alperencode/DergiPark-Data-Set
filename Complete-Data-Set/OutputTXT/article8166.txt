Makale Başlığı: ARGUMENTATIVE ASPECTS OF THE PRIMACY AND RECENCY EFFECTS: A RETURN TO CLASSICAL RHETORIC
Özet: The goal of this article is to examine and present the rhetorical applications of two important processes affecting human communication – the primacy effect and the recency effect. They are determined by two major factors – the time period by which are separated the messages, and the time that has the audience at its disposal to make decision and/or to judge upon the orator’s claim. Different models are proposed for intensification of these effects by expanding or reducing the length of the speech on three main levels – the order of delivering the speeches, the order of presenting the information, and the structure of the argument.

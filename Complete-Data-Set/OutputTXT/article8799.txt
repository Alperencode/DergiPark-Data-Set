Makale Başlığı: The Management of Tourism Activities at Local Level Within the Scope of Administrative Structure of Provinces and Governance Principles: The Case of Ordu Province
Özet: Tourism mainly covers spatial activities. Tourism, which is increasingly important in the development of the country, is an important competitive tool from local to international. Bringing local potentials into the economy in a planned way has an important place in local development. Bringing together different sources of expertise and knowledge, capital and other resources, cooperation, stakeholder contribution and consensus will provide a competitive advantage to be able to control and manage tourism activities at the local level. In the literature, there are studies that examine the development of tourism with collaborative approaches at the local level and the duties and responsibilities of local governments towards tourism. However, no research has been found that examines the management of tourism activities at the local level in terms of the administrative structure of the province, governance principles and stakeholder theory. As a result of this research, suggestions are presented for the management of tourism activities, stakeholder contribution, cooperation, coordination, planning, branding and marketing.

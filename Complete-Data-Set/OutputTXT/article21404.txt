Makale Başlığı: Nonlinear adaptive semiactive control of a half-vehicle model via hardware in the loop simulation
Özet: In this study, vehicle body vibrations are semiactively controlled using a nonlinear adaptive controller  designed to improve passenger comfort by guaranteeing closed loop system stability under variable road disturbances  with parametric uncertainty. Semiactive vibration control is implemented to the system through the magnetorheological  damper. The MR damper test system is established in laboratory conditions, and the required values that are measured  from the test system are used in computer simulations via the hardware in the loop simulation  HILS  method. By this  way, it is possible to avoid the financial and other difficulties of the experimental study by establishing the test system  completely, and also the hesitations that may arise in terms of producing realistic results of pure simulation studies of  nonlinear dynamics. A 4-degree-of-freedom half-vehicle model is developed to examine the vehicle body bounce and pitch  movements, and simulations are carried out under bump and random road irregularities, and the results are presented  in comparison with the performance of the conventional skyhook controller. The performances of both controllers are  interpreted from the aspect of acceleration and displacement responses of the vibrations and related criteria. As a result,  the vibration reduction performances of both controllers are investigated experimentally using the HILS test system and  the obtained results are evaluated with some comparative figures, performance criteria, and root mean square averages  of vibrations.

Makale Başlığı: Law of Minorities
Özet: Minority is one of the two important concepts in international law that have not been definitively defined yet. Very few countries have homogeneous population in ethnic, religious and/or religious terms. Minority law, despite the ambiguity of the universal definition, is a branch that has been around for centuries. If we take the law of minorities as a relationship of states with minorities on their land, we can go back to the earliest milestone. However, it is a broad consensus that the law of minorities, in modern history, began to evolve with the 1648 Westphalia Treaty, unless some early examples, such as the 1598 Treaty of Nantes, envisioning France’s revenge on protestants.

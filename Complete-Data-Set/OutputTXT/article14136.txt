Makale Başlığı: THE CONCEPT OF LIBERTY IN TERMS OF NAMIK KEMAL’S PERSPECTIVE
Özet: The man was a being who first acts and then thinks. People who were equal in the first stages, but lost this equality, later on, became enslaved. People that realized slavery sought equality and freedom. The word freedom was primarily remembered during the French Revolution, and concepts such as equality, fraternity and homeland emerged with freedom in this period. In Turkish literature, these words are referred to by Namık Kemal. Namık Kemal has an important place in Turkish modernization. He was one of the influential intellectuals of the Ottoman Empire during his lifetime. Namık Kemal, who developed ideas for the survival of the Ottoman Empire and tried to explain them with works such as newspapers, poetry, novels and theater, was among the pioneers of the New Ottomans movement. Namık Kemal, who added words such as homeland, nation and freedom to Turkish literature, pioneered many thinkers in this field. This study examines Namık Kemal's understanding of "freedom". Although Namık Kemal had ties to Europe, he did not think of modernization as a total westernization. Still, he believed that only using technology and understanding science should be taken from it. He never thought of breaking his ties with Islam and Turkish culture; on the contrary, he attempted to synthesize the scientific developments of Islam and the West.

Makale Başlığı: THE INVASION OF GRAND DUCHIES OF RUSSIA AND EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN LANDS BY THE MONGOLS
Özet: For centuries, Central Europe was invaded by various peoples (Germanic, Visigoth, etc.) and suffered great damage from that. However, the main damage to Europe was the violent invasions of the tribes that came from the Asian steppes with their fast horses and strong organizational structures. The Huns, led by Attila, were the first tribe to initiate that, and they went down to Gaul and Italy. In the meantime, the tribes that they brought in and forced to migrate caused significant changes in the demographic structure of Europe. The second major invasion was carried out by the Mongols led by Batu, the son of Jochi, and the famous Mongolian commander Subetei. With a route drawn from the north of the Black Sea, they first subjugated the Kipchaks and Bulgarians, then the Russians, and finally invaded Hungary. In our study, the invasion of Central Europe by the Mongols, the events that prepared this process will be discussed chronologically and a general evaluation of the invasion will be made.

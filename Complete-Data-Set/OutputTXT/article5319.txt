Makale Başlığı: Origen's Conception of Universal Salvation: Apokatastasis
Özet: The doctrine of apokatastasis, which he describes as the return of all souls to their original pure state of mind, is an important example among Origen's theological teachings. However, this doctrine is also one of the most controversial issues in his theology. Believing that the end should resemble the beginning, Origen offers a universal understanding of salvation in which all beings will ultimately be saved by reconciling human freedom and the plan that createdby God for humanity.The effect of this teaching of Origen on the period after him is especially evident on theologians who were supporters of the apokatastasis doctrine, such as Didymus The Blind, Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius and Gregory of Nazianzus. In this context, he is one of the main figures whose views are included not only in the early period, but also in the discussions with the understanding of universal salvation within the church from past to present. In this study, our aim is to reveal the nature of the apokatastasis phenomenon by examining Origen's statements on the subject in a comprehensive and analytical manner based on his works. There is no independent study in this framework in our field. In this context, it is important to consider the early views and interpretations of the salvation theory, which are related to modern thoughts, both in terms of helping us retrieve a fuller picture of the patristic mindset and laying the groundwork for further studies on the doctrine of apokatastasis and the understanding of universal salvation.

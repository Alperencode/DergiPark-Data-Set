Makale Başlığı: To be able to Stay Connected with the Tradition in the Modern Age (On the occasion of 2018 Yeditepe Biennial)
Özet: The Turkish Language Association has described the traditional as "traditionally based". From this description, it is possible to understand that traditional arts linked to traditions. However, it is difficult to stick to a tradition, because traditional is not something static, but also something that is renewed. It is a well-known fact that it is time to discuss whether many of the art works made under the name traditional today, whether they are traditional or not, whether they are art or not. Traditional arts were taught and supervised by the foremen to apprentices thanks to the organization of the artists in the palace during the Ottoman centuries. In this respect, art style could have the same or similar characteristics throughout the country. Local artisans,too, often emulated central artistic style, even if they produced their own unique works. Today, there has been a disintegration in our traditional arts, as there is no higher organization to provide central control. Instead of developing a common style, individual works or group works around some masters are presented as traditional. Most of the time, these groups or individuals have lost their traditional way under the influence of modern approaches. In this article, the question of where the traditional arts stuck in the modern age clamp is going to be questioned, the current state of modern desire and enthusiasm and the traditional approaches of the artists will be discussed.

Makale Başlığı: Gender and Being a Woman Mining Engineer in Turkey
Özet: The examination of the mining engineering profession from the perspective of female engineers and the investigation of the profession in terms of gender equality constitute the main scope of this study. This study also aims to identify and offer solutions to the problems based on sexist roles faced by female mining engineers in Turkey who have studied mining engineering and are currently practising their profession. In this context, a field study was conducted based on the views of 103 participants. In the study, a digital questionnaire consisting of two parts was distributed to the participants. In the first part of the questionnaire, demographic information was asked, and in the second part, questions about the gender-based evaluation of female engineers' professions were asked. Solution suggestions were presented by evaluating and interpreting the data obtained from the study.

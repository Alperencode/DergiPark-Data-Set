Makale Başlığı: Early intervention to risk groups with the QR code system in  disasters
Özet: While disasters are situations in which people cannot cope with their own capacities, it is impossible for risk groups that need the care of others not to be affected by it. Our country is frequently exposed to disasters due to its geopolitical position, irregular population growth, being a developing country, increased industrialization, insufficient infrastructure, and many other reasons. It is very important that disadvantaged community members who need help are easily accessible and identifiable at the time of disaster. The main purpose of this study is to provide the fastest, most accurate and reliable information to the elderly living alone, to children who lost their parents during the event, to women, to those who cannot do the work they need to do on their own in their personal or social life due to any deficiencies, to those who have their own disease and who have been harmed by disasters. In this study, the risk groups that will be affected by disasters were determined and the data of the people created as an example were transferred to the data matrix system. First of all, individuals in risk groups (disabled, chronic patients, elderly, children and women) were determined and then a data matrix was created on the website.

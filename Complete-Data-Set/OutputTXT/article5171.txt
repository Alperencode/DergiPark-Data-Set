Makale Başlığı: Carrier Status in Foot-and-Mouth Disease
Özet: In the disease endemic countries such as Turkey, a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus carrier animal is critical in reducing the risk of disease and eradication. In recent years, FMD carrier animals, persistence mechanisms, and the fight against carriers have started to be focused on again. A five-stage gradual disease eradication plan called PCP-FMD (Progressive Control Pathway-FMD) was designed by Office International des Epizooties (OIE) and Food and Agricultural Organization United Nations (FAO) for disease eradication. Therefore, at each stage, there are activities to be done to move to the next step. One of these activities is the differentiation of infected animals (acute and persistent) from vaccinated ones in herds showing that the risk is zero (zero risk). In this review, studies related to FMD and persistent infections done so far have been evaluated and important information regarding the subject has beengiven. In addition, the points that need to be done in the future have been focused on.

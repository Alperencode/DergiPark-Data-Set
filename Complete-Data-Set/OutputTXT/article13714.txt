Makale Başlığı: FACTOR ANALYSİS FOR CONSTRUCT VALİDİTY: AN APPLİED STUDY
Özet: In this article, the 19-item information dimension of the scale, originally named "Sustainability Consciousness Questionnaire", was developed by Michalos, Creech, Swayze, Kahlke, Buckler & Rempel (2012) and updated by Gericke, Pauw, Berlung & Olsson (2018), whose factor structure was previously revealed. (latent variable) Construct validity was tested by applying it to a new data set of 307 people. IBM SPSS and AMOS statistical package programs were used in the analysis of the data. According to the results obtained in the study; It was found that the information dimension of the scale was gathered under three factors as in the original and it could explain 61.72% of the total variance. As a result of the reliability analysis, it was determined that the scale had a high level of reliability according to the Cronbach's-α coefficient (Cronbach's-α =0.923). In the confirmatory factor analysis, the improvement in the goodness of fit coefficients was examined by controlling the modification indices. In addition, the path coefficients of how much the 19 items belonging to the first level of the scale predict the latent variable are all significant. Among the items, it was found that the 13th and 14th items had the most effect (β1= 0.828, p<0.01).

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Quality Characteristics and Compliance with Standards of Wood Pellet Samples Produced in Turkey
Özet: In this research, the quality properties of wood pellets produced and sold as fuel in our country were determined and the compliance of solid biofuels with different standards (DIN51731, DIN Plus, ÖNORM 7135, ISO 17225-2) related to fuel properties investigated. In addition, flue gas analyzes were carried out for these samples. The emission results obtained were compared with the emission limits determined by the European Union regulations of 2015/1185 and 2015/1189, TS EN 303-5 standard, regulations on "Control of Industrial Air Pollution" (SKHKKY) and “Regulation on Control of Air Pollution Resulting from Heating" (IKHKKY)”. For this purpose, samples were collected from 10 different companies that manufacture and sell wood pellets from 5 different cities in Turkey, and the length (mm), diameter (mm), density (kg/m3), mechanical strength (%) , moisture content (%), ash content (%), calorific value (MJ/kg) and flue gas emission values were determined. According to the measurement results, It was determined that the length value is between 15.69-30.82 mm, the diameter value is between 6.06-10.39 mm, the density value is between 0.51-1.15 kg/m3, the mechanical strength value is 95.11-99.22%, moisture contents between 4.32-5.72%, ash contents between 1.03-2.03%, and heating values between 18.08-18.49 MJ/kg. Among the flue gas emission values, the O2 content was measured between 12.7%-71.7%, the amount of CO was measured between 1443-2127 ppm, and the amount of NOx was measured between 83.7-213 ppm. In terms of the limit values for the quality characteristics specified in the ISO 17225-2 standard, which is also valid in our country, 100% of the samples are suitable in terms of length, moisture content and heating value; In terms of diameter and bulk density, 80% of the samples were determined to comply with the standards.On the other hand, when the ash content results were examined, it was determined that the samples were not suitable for ENplusA1 class, 40% of the samples were in ENplusA2 class and 80% were in ENplusB class, 20% of the samples were non-standard. The CO emission values in the flue gas samples resulting from the burning of the pellet samples exceeded the emission limit value determined in the EU regulations, so it was determined that the pellet samples examined within the scope of this study were not suitable for any heating system specified in the EU Ecodesign-directive. Likewise, when the emission limits determined in IKHKKY and SKHKKY are examined, it has been determined that the pellet samples are not suitable in terms of CO emission in the combustion systems specified in these regulations. According to the CO emission values specified in the TS EN 303-5 standard, all the pellet samples we examined can only be used in all heating systems up to "Class 3" up to 50 kW thermal power, 80% of the pellets can be used in systems with 50kW-150 kW thermal power but  it has been determined that none of them is suitable for systems with higher thermal power.

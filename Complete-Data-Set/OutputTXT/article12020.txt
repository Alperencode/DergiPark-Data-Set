Makale Başlığı: INFLUENCE OF TAXATION ON THE TURKISH PHILOSOPHY OF ACCOUNTING: 1923- 1950
Özet: The years 1923-1950 have a special place in the Turkish philosophy of accounting. These are the years of the Republic’s establishment. The Republic adopted a mixed economy model. The founder of the republic, Atatürk, and his friends were putting the main laws of the Republic into order on the one hand, while on the other hand, they were trying to spread accounting education throughout Turkey and equip the tradespeople who would sustain it. However, in 1926, when they abolished the ‘Aşar’ tax collected based on Islamic rules and started efforts to establish modern tax laws, it was seen that the approach of accounting developing over taxation became dominant over the approach of accounting that is realized in the world of commerce. Thus, throughout the 20th century, accounting had to continue its development under the approach of taxation, and the Commercial Code was neglected. Nevertheless, the significance of accounting and the accountant increased with the help of modern tax laws, and tax started to be collected from accounting records and profits for the first time. Although it was under the Ministry of Finance, the academic world constantly contributed to the development of accounting, and during the aforementioned period, development of the double-entry bookkeeping method and making it prevalent have become the main effort of academicians.

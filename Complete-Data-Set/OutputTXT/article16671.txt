Makale Başlığı: A PRODUCTION-BASED DECISION-MAKING SAMPLING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF LINEAR ALGEBRA APPLICATIONS ON THE AXIS OF WOOD MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT
Özet: In this study, an imaginary linear programming activity performed to make the right decision by providing the most appropriate solution with the possibilities available through mathematical modeling is exemplified on the ground of operations research, which is an optimization technique applied by establishing a causal link to solve problems with certain common features. Accordingly, with the problem exemplified by its four-stage problematicality, the following issues have been clarified for a draft product typing with certain proportions of wood material in its construction in terms of design setup: 1) the minimum number of product types that will maximize customer satisfaction has been determined by graphically supported linear programming within the modeling created with the existing constraints; 2) how much the material usage amounts and the cost of material procurement will be for the realization of the draft products, which will be manufactured as integrated with different materials accompanied by wood, and how these will be reflected in the whole production, and 3) how the products to be produced will be shipped to the target markets in the context of transportation costs, has been revealed by creating matrices by means of content coding, 4) how many times the market research should be done with the lowest cost within a certain cycle, in order to evaluate the opinions of customers about the usefulness and likability of new product types, was modeled in accordance with the existing constraints and presented with linear programming accompanied by graphics. This research sheds light on a manufacturing management that will be carried out with linear programming models and matrixing evaluations based on linear algebra applications in order to make an optimal decision to solve the current problem and eliminate possible problems by making a correlation between the cause and the effect.

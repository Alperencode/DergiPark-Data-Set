Makale Başlığı: DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BODY IN LIN TIANMIAO'S ART
Özet: In this article, the subject of body in Contemporary Chinese Art will be discussed. In the axis of thesubject, four works of Lin Tianmiao that he produced by positioning the human body in the centerbetween 1994 and 2014 will be included. While these studies refer to the subject through metaphorsin the works titled The Temptation of Saint Teresa, Protruding Patterns, in her works titled Day-Dreamer, Initiator she put woman body images at the center of her artistic creations. Lin Tianmiao,draws attention with her innovative approach to the body subject in the context of content and formin the international contemporary art arena. In addition, her art differs in her unique interpretation ofthe forms it has chosen to create her installations, using traditional textile materials such as silk andcotton fabric, cotton thread.The artist has shaped her individual and cultural experiences with a unique language of creation andhas given them a universal quality. She basically sets out from her autobiography and produces herworks by integrating her artistic problematics with the data of the culture she lived in. The body, oneof the primary subjects of art, creates new examples in Lin Tianmiao's works in the context of formcontent-material integrity, based on the mentioned influences. The artist draws his influence in thecontemporary art world from his skill of combining these elements by masterfully synthesizing themand presenting them in a plain and sincere way.

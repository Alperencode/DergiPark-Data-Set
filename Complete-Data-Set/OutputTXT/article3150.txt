Makale Başlığı: Middle School Boys’ and Girls’ Career Aspirations in Science and Mathematics
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine secondary school students' desire to pursue a career in science and mathematics in 2011 and 2015, taking into account gender differences, and to examine how variables related to students' socioeconomic status, motivation and performance predict the desire of female and male students to pursue a career in science and mathematics. The number of books, study environment at home and parents’ educational levels were analyzed as SES variables. While motivational variables were students’ self-efficacy and task value beliefs, performance related variables were their achievement and engagement. The data of the eighth-grade students from Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011 and 2015 were analyzed. To investigate the year differences of girls’ and boys’ career aspirations in science and mathematics, Chi-Square test was performed. In addition, logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relation between students’ SES, motivation, performance and career aspirations for 2011 and 2015 data separately. The results have indicated that students’ motivation was the strongest and the most common predictor of career aspirations in science and mathematics for boys and girls.

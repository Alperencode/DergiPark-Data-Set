Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Properties Related Salinity in Arsuz Plain Soils
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the salinity and alkalinity properties of Arsuz Plain soils and to examine the relationships between exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in the soils. In the study, 37 degraded soil samples were taken from 0-30 cm depth of Arsuz plain. In the soil samples; pH, electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable sodium (Na) and potassium (K), cation exchange capacity (KDK), soluble cations (Na, K, Ca and Mg) and anions (CO3, HCO3, Cl and SO4), texture and lime contents were determined according to common methods. Again, exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) values were calculated using exchangeable sodium (Na) and cation exchange capacity values, and SAR values were calculated using soluble Na, Ca and Mg values. In addition, the relationships between exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were investigated by linear regression analysis. In addition, the relations between these properties and other soil properties were determined by correlation analysis. The pH values of the soils varied between 7,51 and 8,19 EC values between 0,500 and 0,315 dS m-1. Lime content of the soils is 1,01% to 23,02%, KDK values are 15,15 – 38,17 me/100 g, exchangeable sodium (Na) contents are 0,15 to 4,60 me/100 g, K contents are 0,19 to 1,74 me/100g, Ca+ Mg contents are 14,68 to 37,09 me/100 g, ESP values varied between 0,50 and 18,03% and ESR values between 0,005 and 0,220. The average clay, sand and silt contents of the soils were determined as 42,6%, 24,7 and 32,6%, respectively. Statistically significant positive correlations were determined at 0,01 level between ESR and SAR values of soils (r2= 0,677) and between ESP and SAR values (r2= 0,702). The Gapon coefficient (Kg) of the ESR-SAR relationship in soils was determined as 0,01457.

Makale Başlığı: Qaf" Mountaın between the Qur'anic and mythological perspectives: Critical study
Özet: The mention of the word "Qaf" in the Qur'an and the meanings it indicates, its relation with a great mountain called "Qaf" surrounding the earth, and the belief that it is the origin of other mountains have been the subject of various fields, and have been searched by linguists, commentators of Qur’an and sufis as well as different experts. It has been discussed by scholars of different fields from past to present. There have been different opinions on this issue. All of these views are based on the following: Meanings of the four verses mentioned in the Book of Almighty Allah, some narrations from some of the Prophet’s companions and followers, the observations of the people of mysticism and the records of Israiliyyat transmitted by the people of the book. However, some malevolent people abused the subject matter, claiming that the Qur'an is a book containing superstitions and myths and in this way, they engaged scholars in a polemic of confirmation and denial. In this regard, they are divided into two: The proponents who base their imagination and ijtihad on the transmitted or emotional evidence reaching them, and the opponents who base their ijtihad on the legal evidence and realistic observations. Through this article, the researcher aimed to extract evidence from the words of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and the ideas of commentators, linguists, travelers, geographers, mystics and other scholars and to trace them. In the way of reaching this goal, the doubts raised on the subject, the chain of answers written in this context and critical-analytical studies have been taken into consideration. Thus, it is our aim to obtain important results that will hopefully be useful on the occasion of this research.

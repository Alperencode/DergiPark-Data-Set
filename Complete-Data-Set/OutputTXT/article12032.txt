Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACCOUNT CONSERVATISM AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS: BIST APPLICATION
Özet: In this study, the relationship between the prudence levels and liquidity ratios of the businesses traded in BIST 30 between 2005 and 2020 was tested with the panel data analysis method, which allows time and cross-section data to be analyzed together. The negative accrual method developed by Givoly and Hayn (2000) was used to calculate the prudence level. Regarding liquidity ratios; current ratio, liquidity ratio (acid test ratio) and cash ratio data were used. The data used in the research were obtained from the financial statements and cash flow statements of the businesses. According to the results of the F test and Breusch-Pagan LM test, which were used to analyze the estimator method of the data, the fact that the probability values were p>0.05 showed that the pooled data set model would yield more effective results compared to the fixed or random effects model. It has been determined that the probability value of all of our independent variables including current ratio, liquidity ratio and cash ratio variables was p>0.05 and that there was no significant relationship between the prudence levels of the businesses and the current ratio, liquidity ratio and cash ratio, which show the ability to pay their short-term debts.

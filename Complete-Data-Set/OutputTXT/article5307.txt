Makale Başlığı: SUGAR IN THE CRUSADES AND ITS JOURNEY TO THE WEST
Özet: We call the years 1095-1291 “The Age of Crusaders”, and this process was the meeting of civilizations as well as hostilities. The Crusaders, who did not know much about the Islamic civilization, started to get to know them with the first contacts. In the meantime, they began to meet new and unfamiliar flavors such as candy. The Crusaders, who took over the sugar factories in the cities they captured in Syria, started to export the sugar they produced from here to Europe as well as consuming them themselves. While Italian merchants started to earn a lot of money from this business, Europeans who sweetened with honey began to get used to this new product. After that, sugar began to be transported to the West by ships, and the first steps of exploitation began to be taken. Sugar production centers of the former Byzantine Empire, such as Cyprus Island in 1191 and Rhodes in 1310, were included in the ships loaded with sugar from ports such as Akkâ, Tyre, and Beirut. From this work, of course, the Venetians and the knightly orders started to increase their wealth.

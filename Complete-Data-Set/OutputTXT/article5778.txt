Makale Başlığı: The Road From Becoming General To Getting Hanged: (Dadaş) Rüştü Paşa’s Political And Military Activities
Özet: The interlocking process, which focused on the liberation of the National Struggle years and eliminated all differences, started to turn into a cross roads with the first years of the republic. Many of the military and political administrators, who acted as saviors in the first phase of this process, took an oppositional stance against the radical revolutions in the new period. Rüştü Pasha, who is one of the most important examples of this radical change, is the subject of this study, and his role in the political opposition studies initiated against Mustafa Kemal in the political sense and the process leading to an assassination are discussed in this study. In these years, when intellectual differences and the current political atmosphere pushed him into opposition, Rüştü Pasha did not neglect to stay in the background as he had throughout his entire career, but to assume an oppositional duty, instead of being an independent and stand-alone opposition. However, Rüştü Pasha, who deserved the title of a reliable and loyal second man throughout his military activities, became a staunch opponent in parliamentary activities. The main goal of the study is to reveal the process that led him to take part in an event such as the Izmir Assassination and therefore to death. The study was prepared by examining archival documents, newspapers, memoirs and various research works.

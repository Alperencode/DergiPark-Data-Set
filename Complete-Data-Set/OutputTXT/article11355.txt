Makale Başlığı: A Multidisciplinary Assessment on the dominance of contemporary western culture and EU civilization
Özet: After the Cold War, the Clash of Civilizations thesis defended conflict between the West and Muslims. Samuel Huntington was instrumental in legitimizing and supporting the conflict between Islam and the West. According to this theory, conflicts will arise from cultural and religious reasons, not between ideologies and states. They will be the scene of clashes, especially between Western and Islamic civilizations. Although nation-states continue to be the main actors in the global system, their traditional sovereignty structures will erode, continuing their essential functions under the umbrella of civilization. While this theory is being discussed, statistics reveal that social, cultural, economic discrimination and intolerance, called Islamophobia, is being developed against Muslims, whose members are constantly increasing in western countries after the Cold War. This article examines the relationship between Islamophobia, rising in Europe, and the Clash of Civilizations thesis, with a multidisciplinary approach of theology, history, economics, and politics of assertions done in the Risale-i Nur Collection writings by Said Nursi.

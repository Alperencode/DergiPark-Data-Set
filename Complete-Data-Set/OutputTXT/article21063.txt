Makale Başlığı: THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCES OF IQTA ON GHILMAN DURING THE SELJUK PERIOD
Özet: For about a century and a half, the Great Seljuk Empire centrally and sometimes indirectly ruled the territories that now occupy the lands of twenty countries. The structural and institutional capacities and efficiencies of this political existence had innovations in various fields, including reestablishing the cut off system in the field of optimal administration of large government lands and balancing the administration of centrifugal areas in different districts. The Iqta Institute connected the military and economic sectors and solved many probems in the administrative field. Nevertheless some inefficiencies of the Iqta institutions resulted in political refusal during this period of time. Among them was the transfer of notable border provinces, especially the eastern borders (ghilman sepahsalar) which gradually created the grounds for the formation of independent regional states.During the Seljuk period it underwent a transformation under the leadership of Nizam al-Mulk, took on a totally new face, and with its Seljuk nature became a model for other Turkish Muslim states. İn addition to the above discussion, the present study intends to investigate the transfer of limbs to slaves in the Seljuk period.

Makale Başlığı: RECENT HEALTH POLICIES AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS IN TURKEY: AN ANALYSIS ON THE ACCESS AND USE OF HEALTH SERVICES BY ROMA WOMEN IN IZMIR
Özet: As a requirement of the rule of law, the emphasis on providing "equal" public services to everyone is frequently mentioned in Turkey. The Health Transformation Program, which was launched in 2003, has also been established with the principles of equality, equity and inclusiveness. However, when the socio-economic determinants of health come into play, access of disadvantaged groups to health services becomes problematic and some practices involving unequal health access emerge. The Roma, being  one of the disadvantaged groups in Turkey, have also problems in accessing public services in general and public health services in particular.  There is an emerging literature on exploring the Roma’s access to public health services in Turkey. Nevertheless, this literature does not address the experiences of Roma women in detail. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine Roma women’s experiences in accessing health services and hence to contribute to this emerging literature by focusing and highlighting women’s experiences. For this purpose, qualitative interviews were conducted with sixteen Roma women residing in Karşıyaka district of İzmir.  As a result of these interviews, it was understood that socio-economic indicators of Roma women were significant in accessing health services and receiving fair treatments.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues in air and pollen samples and pollutant partition between these environments
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the regional and temporal variations of organochlorine pesticide (OCP) concentrations in air and pollen samples in urban and semi-urban areas and the distribution between air/pollen. A total of 10 OCP (∑10OCP) concentrations in air and pollen samples during the sampling period were determined as 318.2±73.7 pg/m3 and 21.7±5.1 ng/g for the urban sampling point and 390.1±103.5 pg/m3 and 20.0±3.3 ng/g for the semi-urban point, respectively. In addition, it was determined that α-HCH and endosulfanß compounds were the most dominant OCP compounds in both pollen and air samples. High OCP concentrations were measured at both sampling points, usually during the summer months. Pollen/air partition coefficient (𝐾𝑃𝐴) was calculated to determine OCP exchange between air and pollen. According to the results obtained, it has been determined that there are generally OCP transitions from pollen to ambient air at both urban and semi-urban sampling points.

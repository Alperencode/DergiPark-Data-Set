Makale Başlığı: A RESEARCH ON DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION EXECUTIONS IN TURKISH CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Özet: Industry 4.0 and digitalization have affected all industries as well as the construction industry, that has an important place in the Turkish economy. However, there are criticisms that the construction industry lags other industries in terms of using technology and keeping up with this digital transformation. Thus, finding the factors that affect the adaptation of digital transformation applications in Turkish construction industry constitutes the aim of this study. In this study, the digitalization technologies, driving factors, barriers and success factors affecting implementation of digitalization in construction industry were determined respectively. Then, a survey was conducted with a total of 50 attendees. Obtained data were analyzed by using “Relative Importance Index” method. The results of the analysis show that while Building Information Modeling is frequently used in the Turkish construction industry; applications such as augmented reality, blockchain and smart contract are not commonly used yet. According to the analysis results while effective quality, document and communication management constitute the most important driving factors for Turkish construction companies to adapt to digital transformation; the lack of sufficient competent personnel and the lack of integration for all stakeholders were the crucial factors affecting the digital transformation of the Turkish construction industry For the construction industry, that has the lowest impact level of Industry 4.0 and digitalization compared to other industries, the number of studies that reveal the driving forces, obstacles and the success criteria affecting digital adaptation are few in number. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of these factors specific to the Turkish construction industry constitutes the originality of this study.

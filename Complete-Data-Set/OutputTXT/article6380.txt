Makale Başlığı: DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF LAURIC ACID OLEOGELS
Özet: In this study, sunflower oil oleogels were developed with lauric acid, Span 60, and Pluronic F68 (10% poloxamer 188). Physicochemical, thermal, structural, and rheological properties of the oleogels were determined. The gel formation time of oleogels containing only LA (20%) was shorter than oleogels containing 15% LA and 5% emulsifiers, and an increase in LA concentration shortened the gel formation time. While there were differences in the color values of the oleogels depending on the LA concentration and emulsifier type, the oil binding capacity of all oleogel samples were quite high. The crystalline structures were observed under polarized light microscope, and the X-ray diffraction patterns proved the existence of β and β՛ polymorph crystals. Rheological analyses indicated that oleogels had good structural recovery ability. Further, addition of emulsifier allowed oleogel formation with lower concentrations of LA, and at the same time the gel stability was enhanced with emulsifier.

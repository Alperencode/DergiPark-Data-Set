Makale Başlığı: The Use Of Music In Cinema To Create Dramatic Impact And Perspective
Özet: Every film is perceived as a whole with its characters, story and plot. One of the most important components for the success of the film is the music or the soundtrack of the film. The film music includes perceptions of the characters' situations, roles or functions, the relationships between the characters, and the interpretation of the film narrative. The film music has a strong influence on the audience's attitudes towards the characters, objects, time, place, and, in general, the story. Film music is an important factor and one of the most important elements of the cinematic expression tools that keeps the audience active and constantly makes the audience think throughout the film. In this context, it would not be wrong to say that the film music has the power to change the narrative of the film. But it's not always easy to answer the questions of what film music does, why it exists, or why it should exist. In this study, it has been tried to examine and explain how important the film music is in the film narrative and how motivating and how powerful it is for the audience to create meaning.

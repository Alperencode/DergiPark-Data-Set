Makale Başlığı: Job Stress Assessment and Factors Analysis Influencing health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia
Özet: This paper was undertaken to explore the influences of sociodemographic, psychological, and financial factors on work-related stress amongst health employees in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic. The study was conducted in some hospitals on 204 health workers. The techniques mainly include the statistical methods and self-administered questionnaires held in the hospitals. The analysis was carried out using Regression Model, a multivariate Structural Equation Model. Descriptive statistics, chi-square distribution, and correlation of the factors were employed to assess the factors. The preliminary analysis depicted that the financial factors have the most significant effects. It was found that the work-related stress increases by 0.280 units on average when the overall psychological stress level increases 1 unit negatively when all other constraints (financial, people living with workers, and hour's spending outside) are kept fixed. For qualitative factors, linguistic terms such as "Moderate, high, low, etc." were used to analyse the data. Moreover, a cluster analysis was carried out to determine the level of financial stress and the factors causing psychological stress. In contrast, the structural equation model depicted that not all sociodemographic factors are linked to work stress among health workers. This study will indorse all related bodies to establish a new approach to relieving health workers of financial burdens and provide them with efficient counseling and psychosocial management interventions.

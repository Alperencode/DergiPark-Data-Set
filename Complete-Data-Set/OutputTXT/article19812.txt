The concept of the foreign aids with the primary goal to eradicate poverty is notnew to economy and social development scholars since it has been researched for decades.Methodology- The poverty eradication was adopted from what so called the Millennium Development goal (1990-2015) and Sustainabledevelopment goal that is expected to come to an end in 2030. This study qualitatively accesses the impact and the effectiveness of theforeign aid given to most developing countries with the aim to eradicate the poverty level.Findings- The main objective of this paper is having an empirical conclusion on the effectiveness of the foreign aid through the criticalempirical reviews of the both quantitative and qualitative works done by different scholars in different countries.Conclusion- The study concluded that quantitatively it is illogical to conclude weather the foreign aid really contributes to poverty reductionin recipient’s country or not. This backed up by the presence of both empirical studies both in favour and against of foreign aids.

Those factors include conditions attached to aids, allocation of the aids to targeted areas, authority of the states in decisionmaking related to foreign aid and political influence. Finally, the study suggested that for efficient use the foreign aids countries should havea clear stipulated goals and area of prioritization. The countries also should have a clear monitoring mechanism to supervise the progress ofthe funds expenditure over time

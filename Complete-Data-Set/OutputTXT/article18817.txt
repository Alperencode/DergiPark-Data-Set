Makale Başlığı: Behaviour Patterns Of Azerbaijani And Turkish Proverbs In The Form Of "Evvel-Ahir" (Beginning-End) Or "Herf Uste"
Özet: The article deals with the patterns of Azerbaijani and Turkish proverbs and sayings in the form of "evvel-ahir" which are not found in any source so far. It is noted that one of the most widespread, rich and colourful types of ashug literature is the poetry in the form of "evvel-ahir (beginning-end). Mostly written as couplets, gerayli, rubai, mukhammas, bayati, divani, etc., such poems end on the same letter with which they begin. Such poems are sometimes called "Herfuste" poems (letter by letter). M.Gasimli and M.Allahmanli note that although there is no such strict prohibition, such poems are usually built on consonantal sounds. But there are a lot of  "beginning-end" verses that start with vowels. Does 'evvel-ahir' refer to other samples of folklore, for instance, to proverbs? The research shows that there are enough such examples in both Azerbaijani and Turkish proverbs. And this, of course, shows the richness of the ancient Turkic-Oguz tribes in the field of thought, ideological and aesthetic globalism, and their immeasurable richness of artistic taste and cosmic scale. We believe that their study is both interesting and necessary, not only to study the history of folklore, but also to study the beauty of our language and our language in terms of preserving the created spiritual treasure, and to get a clear picture of the proverbs and proverbs as a whole. This of course demonstrates the relevance of the work. Note that we use the term "evvel-ahir proverbs" as well as "dudakdegmez proverbs" for the first time.

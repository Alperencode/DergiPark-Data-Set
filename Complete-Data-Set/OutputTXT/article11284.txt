Makale Başlığı: IS TRANSITION TO A GREEN ECONOMY A CRISIS OR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN EMPLOYMENT?: GREEN JOBS IN THE CONTEXT OF GENDER EQUALITY
Özet: The rapid depletion of world resources causes increasing environmental disasters. While this increasehas raised the issue of environmental sustainability to the agenda, over time it has been understood thateconomic, social, and environmental development should take place together. In this context, the transitionto a green economy is proposed as an alternative model. It is expected that green jobs will not only beenvironmentally friendly jobs but also decent jobs. Along with decent work, gender equality is also includedin the goal of sustainable development. Women are lagging behind men in employment participationand access to decent work due to their gender roles. It is a matter of wonder whether this inequality willcontinue in the transition to a green economy. In this study, it is aimed to reveal whether the transition to agreen economy is an opportunity for women to participate in employment. It is believed that the transitionto a green economy will have the opportunity for women to participate in employment in the countries thatproduce gender-sensitive policies, and it threatens to increase gender inequality in the countries that areindifferent to this issue. Policies that are sensitive to gender equality, with the education and qualificationof women, are becoming important.

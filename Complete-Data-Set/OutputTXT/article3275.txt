Özet: The District of Akçadağ is located to the west and southwest of Malatya Plain, within an area covering the northeast extension of the Nurhak Mountains with an elevation above 2,500 meters and the Tohma Basin to the north and Sultansuyu Basin to the east. Akçadağ, in respect to its location, extends towards  Central Anatolia through the Tohma Basin, to Northeastern Anatolia through Malatya Plain and Yazıhan Plain, to Southeastern Anatolia and Mediterranean Region through Sultansuyu Basin. In the surface survey conducted in the District of Akçadağ in 2020-2021 with the authorization of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Directorate General of Cultural Heritage and Museums, tens of settlement areas datable to Iron Age and, numerous kurgans with similar properties to the kurgans of Northeastern Anatolia were found. While mound settlements and ridge settlements in the basins and plains compel attention, numerous stronghold settlements and kurgans have been identified at the sites on the plateaus forming the central part of Akçadağ and on the Akçadağ-Nurhak Mountains that can be dated to Iron Age. In this study, the importance of Akçadağ Region, the characteristics of settlements, the patterns of land use and ceramic finds are discussed in terms of highland cultures and settled agrarian cultures in the Iron Age.

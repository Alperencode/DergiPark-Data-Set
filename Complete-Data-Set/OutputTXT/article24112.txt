Makale Başlığı: Examination of The Relationship Between Crypto Money Bitcoin and Gold
Özet: With the developing technologies in the global financial system, it has become inevitable for cryptocurrencies to form the basis of virtual investment tools as an alternative to physical investment tools and to take place in our lives. Bitcoin is the most well-known and highly traded cryptocurrency among today's cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is defined as virtual money that has nothing to do with central banks or official institutions, as well as can be bought and sold with the currencies of countries. Although these virtual currencies have just entered our lives, they are investment instruments that cannot be physically moved and that can be accessed at any time. Gold, on the other hand, is a less risky investment tool than virtual currencies that can be physically carried. Recently, banks have created a gold account and moved gold online, making it easier to compete with other investment instruments. Since cryptocurrencies are a tool that can only be invested in a virtual environment, gold is made easier to buy and sell like cryptocurrencies. This situation increases the interest in the relationship between gold, which is a traditional investment tool, and crypto money. In this context, it is aimed to measure the relationship between Bitcoin and precious gold. In this study, gold prices and Bitcoin opening prices in Turkey were examined using monthly data between the years 2015-2020. Johansen cointegration test and Granger causality tests were used. It has been determined that there is a one-way causality and short-term relationship from Bitcoin to Gold.

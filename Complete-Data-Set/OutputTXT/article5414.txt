Makale Başlığı: A comparative histopathological evaluation of acute toxicities associated with Scillaren-A, corn cob powder and their combinations in rats
Özet: The purpose of the study was to comparatively evaluate the efficacy of Scillaren-A in rats. A total of 32 female Wistar albino rats were used to develop acute toxicity for 48 h. The rats were randomly divided into four groups including n=8 / each group (G.I-G.IV). Toxicity groups (G.I, G.II, and G.III) and control group (G.IV) were established. The experimental groups were intoxicated with scillaren A, corn cob powder, and their combinations, respectively. The rats in the control group were remained intoxicated and fed with standard pellets. The experiment was ended 48 hours after the intoxication. Histopathological findings in vital organs (liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain) and then other organs (intestine, spleen) were evaluated. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH=7.2) and embedded in paraffin. The histopathologic findings were evaluated on the standard H&E stained sections. The major histopathological changes, vascular changes including hyperemia and haemorrhagia, alterative changes including degeneration and necrosis, inflammation, some regenerative and reparative changes including hyperplasia and fibrosis in organs were scored. It is believed that both formulations can be effective on death later on, be utilized as a rodenticide without environmental toxic effect, and be consumed rapidly by rats due to their attractive chemical traits.

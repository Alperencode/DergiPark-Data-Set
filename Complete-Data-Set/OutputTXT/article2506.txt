Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Participation Banking Personal Finance Loans and Individual Credit Cards Risk with the Consumer Price Index
Özet: Economic circles have constantly been debating whether the loans extended by the banking sector cause inflation or whether inflation increases the volume of credit in the banking sector. It is expected that the funds provided by participation banking, where only real trade is financed, will be included in the production process and will not cause inflation. Despite this, there is no research specific to participation banking in the literature. In this research, it is aimed to investigate the relationship between CPI and participation banking personal finance loans and individual credit cards risk. In the research, monthly personal finance loans and individual credit cards risk data of participation banking published by the BRSA between the periods 2006:01 and 2022:02, and the independent audit reports of participation banks published in quarterly periods were used. In order to determine the relationship between the variables, the series were subjected to the Granger causality test. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that there is a reciprocal causality relationship between the personal finance loans and the CPI, whereas there is no causal relationship between the individual credit cards risk and the CPI. In addition, according to 2021Q4 data, it has been observed that 75.66% of the total personal finance loan financing in participation banking is provided by Türkiye Finans Katılım Bankası. In the conclusion part of the research, suggestions were made for participation banks and policy-makers.

Makale Başlığı: Bourdieusian feel for the game/strategy in Kemal Tahir’s “The Seed in the Steppe”
Özet: Kemal Tahir’s The seed in the steppe (1967) is an insider criticism directed against the leftist tendency to idealize the village institutes with a romantic attittude. One of the ovelooked subthemes in the novel is the agents that are not able to develop necessary strategies to prevent the closure of the institutes. This essay offers a Bourdesian new reading of the novel through focusing on characters who have to pay dear prices for failing to feel the flow of the games played in the field. Habitus which suggests a homeliness, a predisposition is one of the key concepts in Bourdieu’s social theory which aims to observe social agents’s activities in social structures. According to Bourdieu, to succeed in the game, it is most significant that agents with the right habitus does not need to stop and think about all these strategies, they act automatically. Reading The seed in the steppe through the light of these concepts, we discover a new aspect of the criticisms Kemal Tahir directed towards the opening of the village institutes. The historical patrons of the institutes are represented as lacking in strategies and as failures in the games of the political field, also the leading positions in the foundation of the schools cannot find the right strategies to beat the resistance in the local. Moreover agents with the necessary basic skills and strategies to succeed in the field are not in the right positions to bring the project to fruition.

Makale Başlığı: THE EVALUATION OF URBAN OPEN GREEN AREAS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE UNIVERSAL STANDARDS GUIDE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES: THE CASE OF KAHRAMANMARAŞ ENGELLİLER SEVGİ PARK
Özet: Although disabled people, like all urban residents, have the right to benefit from urban open green spaces and move freely in these areas, problems in transportation and the physical environment make this situation difficult. While approximately 15% of the world population (more than 1 billion people) consists of disabled individuals, it is stated that there are 2.511.950 disabled individuals registered in Turkey. The universal design approach has emerged as a result of the studies carried out to ensure that people with disabilities fully and equally benefit from all human rights and freedoms. With the acceptance of the concept of universal design, the "Universal Standards Guide for Persons with Disabilities" was created within the scope of the efforts to establish the standards. This study was carried out in order to evaluate the "Engelliler Sevgi Park" in Kahramanmaraş within the scope of the universal standards guide for persons with disabilities. In this context, the standards under the headings of pedestrian ways and sidewalks, ramps and stairs, pedestrian crossings and parking lots, and open and green areas in the guide and the current situation in the area were evaluated. As a result, it was determined that the current situation in terms of quality and maintenance of floors, ramps and slope conditions, urban furniture, parking lots, and materials used in Engelliler Sevgi Park does not meet the standards, and recommendations for making the necessary arrangements were made based on the criteria specified in the universal standards guide.

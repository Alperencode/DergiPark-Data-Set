Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Waste Rock on the Fertilizer Characteristics of Solid Farm Fertilizer
Özet: In this study which was carried out under laboratory conditions in three frequency series, control 1%, 5% and 10% dose of three rocks that had different characteristics were applied to unfermented solid farm fertilizer. For homogenous application, rocks were added into the solid farm fertilizer with their original moisture after they had been grounded, and having been stirred thoroughly, they were exposed to oxygen fermentation by being stirred twice in a day during the first week and once in two days in the subsequent days. Samples from the fermented solid farm fertilizer were taken on the second and sixtieth days and their effect on calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), phosphorous (P), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) elements, which are water-soluble, were identified. According to the research results, it was found that the effect of the three different rocks which had been added into unfermented fresh solid farm fertilizer at 1 %, 5 % and 10 % rates on the amount of water-soluble calcium, phosphorous and manganese elements in solid farm fertilizer; time, rock dosage and time x rock dosage was significant at p <0.01. The effect of applications on sodium was significant at p <0.01 level only in terms of time whereas it was statistically insignificant in terms of water-soluble magnesium, potassium and iron. In the solid farm fertilizer, the highest amount of water-soluble calcium was obtained in the 1% application of the first and third rocks on the sixtieth day (650,96, mg kg-1, 643,73 mg kg-1), whereas the highest amount of phosphorous was obtained in the 1 % application of the third rock on the sixtieth day (302,47 mg kg-1) and the highest manganese amount was obtained in the 10 % application of the third rock on the second day (3,08 mg kg-1).

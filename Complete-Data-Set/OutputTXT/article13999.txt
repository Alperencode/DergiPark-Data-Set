Makale Başlığı: A DOCUMENT ON EARLY FILM DISTRIBUTION IN ANATOLIA: CINEMA IN SMYRNA
Özet: This article discusses Le cinéma à Smyrne (Cinema in Smyrna), a bulletin prepared by the French Syndical Chamber of Smyrna, probably in late 1912, and published in Ciné-journal: Organe hebdomadaire de l’industrie cinématographique on 25 January 1913. This bulletin is important not only because it documents the cinema venues in Smyrna and its suburbs in 1913 and the market volume of the screenings organized in these venues, but also because it documents a distribution region centered in Smyrna and extending across both the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, as far as Adana. Moreover, the way in which we have access to this bulletin not only demonstrates the possibilities of digital archives, but also serves as living proof of how widely dispersed the sources of national cinema history can be.

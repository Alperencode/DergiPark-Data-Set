Makale Başlığı: Tibiotalocalcaneal Arthrodesis By Using Proximal Humeral Locking Plate
Özet: Objectives: Various kinds of fixation devices can be chosen for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis (TTCA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the short term clinical and radiological results of TTCA procedure with the use of proximal humeral locking plate. Material and Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, patients that had undergone surgery of tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with proximal humeral locking plate were evaluated retrospectively. Eight patients (7 female, 1 male) were evaluated using a variety of methods, including an AOFAS hindfoot scale and a Maryland foot score system. Average age was 53 years (range: 24-67 years) and the mean follow up was 32.6 months (range: 23-54 months). Results: Complete fusion was achieved in 7 patients. Postoperatively, soft tissue infection was observed in 2 patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in 3 patients that was all resolved with medical treatment. At the final follow-up, mean AOFAS Hind foot score was 60 (range: 41-81) and Maryland Foot Score was 67.8 ( range: 41-85).The satisfactory rates by AOFAS and MFS were found as 12.5% (1/8) and 50% (4/8), respectively. One patient had an incomplete union with 5 degrees of heel varus deformity and 5 degrees of equinus deformity was observed in another. There were no implant failure or deformation of the plate during the follow up period. Conclusion: Our study provides support for using a proximal humeral plate for tibiotalocalcaneal fusion. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0083This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

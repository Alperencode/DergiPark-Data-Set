Makale Başlığı: The Astrobiological Significance of Caves on Earth and on Mars
Özet: Caves are geologic entities that can be frequently found around the globe. Cave-like features have been documented on Mars by satellite imagery and special detection devices. On Earth Subterranean habitats like caves might host microbial growth because of their relatively stable physicochemical conditions and mineral rich content. Moreover, caves have also been isolated from UV radiation and other present environmental conditions which actually make them ideal for searching for unique microbial life. Mars is an arid planet with thin atmosphere and quite weak magnetosphere. Therefore Mars as we know is inunhabitable.  Research shows that Mars might have been a wet planet in the past, having streams of running water. Earth like subterranean cavities on Mars might provide protection from these environmental hazards. This makes Earth caves important astrobiological sites as Mars analogues for the investigation of the possibility of life on Mars. Researching caves both on Earth and Mars will provide us insight into extreme life conditions and important astrobiological questions. In this review, we are suggesting that geobiological significance of Earth caves plays an important role in searching for life on Mars and defining Mars analogues on Earth.

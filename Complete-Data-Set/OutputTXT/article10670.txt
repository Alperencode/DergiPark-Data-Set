Makale Başlığı: Age and Body Size of the Mediterranean Chameleon, Chamaeleo chamaeleon (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lacertilia: Chamaeleonidae) Specimens Collected from Adana, Türkiye
Özet: Age structure and body size of the Mediterranean Chameleon, Chamaeleo chamaeleon (Linnaeus, 1758) specimens collected from Akyatan, Adana Province (Türkiye) were investigated using the skeletochronology method and the demographic structure was revealed. The mean age was 3.07 years in females and 2.93 years in males. Derived from the LAG configuration, the age at sexual maturity was 1 year in males and 2 years in females. There was no significant correlation between the SVL and age. Moreover, the mean age and SVL were not statistically different between sexes. Results obtained here indicate that C. chamaeleon is one of the short-living lizard species when compared to other lizards.

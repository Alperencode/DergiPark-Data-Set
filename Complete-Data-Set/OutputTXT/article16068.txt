Makale Başlığı: Predatory arthropod species associated with the cotton seed bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis (Costa) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), and their population changes in cotton in Adana Province, Turkey
Özet: The aim of this study was to determine the predatory insects associated with the cotton seed bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis (Costa) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), and their population Dynamics, in a cotton field in the Balcalı District of Adana Province, Turkey in 2017 and 2018. Field trials were carried out in the Research and Application Area of Çukurova University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant Protection. A total of 19 species, including nine species from Coleoptera, three species from Hemiptera, one species from Neuroptera and four species from Araneae (spiders) were identified. The population densities of the predatory arthropods were lower than that of O. hyalinipennis, and no considerable specific relationships were found between the population densities of O. hyalinipennis and the predatory arthropods identified.

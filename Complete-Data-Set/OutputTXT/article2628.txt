Makale Başlığı: An evaluation on common mistakes in the use of Arabic words.
Özet: In this research, the linguistic mistakes of those who learned this lan-guage later, as well as those who grew up around this language and thought in this language, which we call the mother tongue in short, will be mentioned. At the same time, it is necessary to consider that there may be a change and deterioration in the words of the Arabs today, as well as the fact that the words that we encounter in many places and that are thought to be very well known without subjecting them to any re-search may change, and there are common mistakes even in words en-countered in Arabic texts. In addition, the aim of this research is to raise the language awareness of people related to Arabic and to approach words more carefully, rather than showing the mistakes in the use of words.

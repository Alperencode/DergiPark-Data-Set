Makale Başlığı: Seasonal variations in tap water quality parameters in Çanakkale, Türkiye
Özet: Water pollutants are a major problem for the world.  Especially, heavy metals are significant environmental pollutants due to their tendency on accumulation in organisms and causing toxic effects on humans, animals, and aquatic organisms. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative analyses of pollutants are important. Especially the analysis of contaminants in tap water is important. In this study, unlike previous studies, physicochemical water quality parameters were also studied for the first time along with heavy metal analysis. Water-quality parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) were determined in tap-water by YSI 556 MPS, other parameters such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were determined by electrometric and titrimetric methods. Various anions were analysed with the UV-VIS spectroscopy technique. Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were analysed as pollutants by ICP-OES. Amount of Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb were found as detectable limits, but Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were found 0.003 ppm, 0.173 ppm, 0.009 ppm, and 2.343 ppm, respectively. The pH of the tap water was in the interval 6.64 and 7.12 (mean: 6.85 ± 0.12). Nitrite varied between 0.20 and 0.60 mg/L (average: 0.36±0.001 mg/L) revealing that the tap waters exceeded the TSE standards for first quality drinking waters (0.20 mg/L). The data were evaluated using the relevant statistical analyses

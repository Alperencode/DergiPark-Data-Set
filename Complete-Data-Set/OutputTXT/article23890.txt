Makale Başlığı: THE PREDICTORS OF PAIN INTENSITY IN THE PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Özet: Purpose: The main aim of the study was to investigate the possible predictors of the pain intensity in the patients with low back pain (LBP) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second aim of the study was to compare pain intensity between pre-pandemic, isolation, and controlled social life periods.Material and Methods: Thirty-four individuals with low back pain were included in the study. Three different periods (pre-pandemic, isolation, and controlled social life periods) were evaluated. Pain intensity was evaluated by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The sitting and walking time during the day were asked. Results: The changes over time (pre-pandemic, isolation, and controlled social life periods) in the VAS (p=0.001, η2=0.220), sitting time (p<0.001, η2=0.660), and walking time (p<0.001, η2=0.587) were statistically significant. The shortest walking time was in the isolation period (p<0.001).  The highest sitting time (p<0.001) and the VAS score (p=0.001) were in the isolation period. The VAS score had correlation with sitting time in the isolation period (r= 0.471, p=0.005). The linear regression analysis revealed that sitting time was a significant and independent predictor of the VAS score by explaining 19.8 % of variance in the VAS score in the isolation period.Conclusion: The present study suggests that sitting time is an independent predictor of pain intensity in the patients with LBP during the isolation period. The pain intensity can be decreased by improving physical activity and reduced sitting time in the patients with LBP during the COVID-19 pandemic.

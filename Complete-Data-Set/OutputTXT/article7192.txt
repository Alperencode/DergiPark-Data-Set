Makale Başlığı: Effect of Microalgae Use on Plant Growth in Spinach
Özet: The experiment was carried out in order to demonstrate the effects of using microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris Beyerinck (Beijerinck)), a potential bio-fertilizer, on spinach plant growth. Five different fertilizer doses (control, 25% mineral fertilizer (MG), 50% MG, 75% MG, 100% MG)) and two doses of microalgae (2x107 algae mL-1) were used as materials in the study conducted as a pot experiment under greenhouse conditions. At the end of the study, plant height, root length, stem diameter, leaf number, leaf area, leaf fresh and dry weight, root fresh and dry weight, leaf proportional water content, membrane damage index, TSS (Total soluble solid content), chlorophyll content, lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and APX), were determined and  macro-micronutrient elements [Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg),calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] were analyzed in the leaves. Based on the results, the use of algae on spinach growth caused significant increases on plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, leaf wet-dry weight, root wet-dry weight and P values. However, statistically significant decreases were observed in Fe, Ca and Na values. As a result, it is thought that it will be possible to make a more environmentally friendly and sustainable production by reducing the use of mineral fertilizers by 25% to 50% and using it together with microalgae, an organic biofertilizer.

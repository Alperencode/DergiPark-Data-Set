Makale Başlığı: Motivation and Self-regulation in Math Education: A Case Study
Özet: The purpose of this research is to investigate student’s self-regulation skills and motivation in math education through a case study. We analyzed the participant’s motivation in learning math using the fundamental concepts and approaches of the attribution theory, expectancy-value theory, self-determination theory and self-regulation theory. The participant of the study is a student at a public high school in Istanbul. In our instrumental case study design, we collected data through semi-structured face-to-face interviews and observations for sixteen weeks and online interviews and observations for fifteen weeks (31 weeks in total) in 2019-2020 education year. We have evaluated the case based on the education provided face-to-face and in the time of online education on the participant’s individual study. We have concluded that the participant’s perception and attitude toward math was changed in a positive way, and she could determine her own learning goals and regulate her learning through using appropriate cognitive and motivational strategies.

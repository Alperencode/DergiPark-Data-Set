Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Concepts of "Children of Israel" and "Jews" According to the Holy Qur’an
Özet: Allah mentions Children of Israel as Jews and sometimes Children of Israel whose name has been mentioned most frequently in Holy Qur’an as a society. The reason why Allah addresses the same society in two different ways can be revealed while studying the verses in which the concepts of “Children of Israel” and “Jews” have been mentioned. Generally it is observed that the name “Children of Israelis” is used in the particular verses of Holy Qur’an which adress to the society prior to “exile of Babylon” while the name “Jews” is used in the verses addressing to the post exile society. Some Jewish historians specify their history as either “Children of Israel” or “Jews” just like Holy Qur’an’s categorization method. Additionally it is noticeable that the verses which include the name “Children of Israel” are the ones that don’t criticize the tribe. On the other hand the ones that include the name “Jews” are the critical ones as well as being Medina surahs.

Makale Başlığı: THE HEALING EFFECT OF WATER ON WOMEN'S HEALTH FROM PAST TO PRESENT
Özet: In addition to the new treatment methods brought by technology, water is an important complementary treatment method that has been used from the past to the present. The purpose of this review is to examine the curative effects of water as a complementary treatment on women's health. Hydrotherapy applied during pregnancy reduces anxiety, stress, fatigue and edema, and increases the quality of life. Studies have shown that the use of water in the early stages of labor is effective in reducing labor pain, reduces the use of analgesia, and shortens the delivery time. Water in childbirth reduces anxiety, positively affects women to feel more comfortable and provide more birth control. Hydrotherapy is a method frequently used in the control of premenstrual syndrome from past to present, and it has been shown to be effective in alleviating premenstrual syndrome. It should not be forgotten that all water therapies should be used under the control of trained health professionals and in accordance with recommended protocols in order to be beneficial.

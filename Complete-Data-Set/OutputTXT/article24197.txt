Makale Başlığı: Treatment of Scaphotrapezial Trapezoidal Arthrosis with The Resection Of Distal Pole of Scaphoid
Özet: Objective: The aim of the treatment for scaphotrapezial trapezoidal arthritis is to obtain pain relief while preserving function. The purpose of this work is to describe the surgical technique for resection of the distal quarter of the scaphoid and compare the results of patients treated by resection with patients treated by resection with insertion of a pyrocarbon implant.  Patients and Method: Nine wrists were treated by resection only while eight wrists were treated by resection with implant. The patients were assessed at an average follow up of 77 months.  Results: Postoperative pain scores were 2.1 in the resection only group and 2.6 in the implant group. Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups.  The mean radio-lunate angle increased from 14º to 30º in resection only group (p=0.008). In the implant group there was an increase in radio-lunate angles from 21º to 23º was not significant.  Conclusion: Application of this implant seems to be useful for pain relief and may help prevent secondary deformities. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0156This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

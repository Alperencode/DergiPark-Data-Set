Makale Başlığı: COMMUNICATION, WOMEN AND BLUES MUSIC
Özet: The aim of this study is to analyze how blues music is used in terms of women's communication interms of Nina Simone and Billy Holiday, and to reveal the communication these two artists havewith their songs. In this context, the study aims to reveal how music is used by women as acommunication tool. Blues music has formed the basis of many music genres not only in Americabut all over the world. At the same time, this form of music used by Africans who were forced tomigrate to America to withstand the bad living and working conditions has a much more specialplace for women. Women who could not express themselves due to the conditions of the period hadmuch more difficulty when they were black. Blues artists, who use music very well to expressthemselves under these difficult conditions and try to protect both women's rights and the rights ofblack people, have a very remarkable place. While female blues artists influenced everyone in theworld with their music, they also shared all their feelings, including their problems, sorrows andhappiness, through their songs. In this way, the song has become a tool for them to communicatewith the whole world. Although many Blues women are important singers, Billie Holiday and NinaSimone, one of the well-known names of the recent period, were chosen within the scope of thestudy, since they are considered to be among the first Blues artists.

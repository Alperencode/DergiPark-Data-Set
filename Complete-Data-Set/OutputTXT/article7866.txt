Makale Başlığı: Thermodynamic and Thermophysical Properties of Air as a Mixture by Using Schreiber-Pitzer EoS
Özet: Air is one of the most important substances used in industrial and technological applications. Applications of air require a consistent set of reliable data on its thermodynamic and thermophysical properties. Over the last few decades, researchers have developed a number of empirical and theoretical models for the correlation and prediction of the thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of pure fluids and mixtures. The ideal gas Equation of State (EoS) is used in gas thermodynamic property calculations extensively, but in applications with higher pressure zones, the error levels are increasing. For most applications, an equation of state with better accuracy of thermodynamic properties will be required for extreme cases. In this study, Schreiber-Pitzer EoS is considered for better accuracy of the thermodynamic properties for air mixture. A set of computer programs were developed in java language to calculate the thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of air as a mixture of Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon. The Schreiber-Pitzer EoS results are compared with Peng-Robinson EoS, Redlich-Kwong EoS, Van der Waals EoS, and ideal gas EoS utilizing cubic spline curve fitting for cp values. The thermodynamic and thermophysical property results and percentages of differences are calculated. The percentages of differences are increasing with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature.

He lived between 1838-1912, represented Mustafa Râkım school in jalî thuluth and Yesârîzâde Mustafa İzzet style in jalî ṭa’liq and trained hundreds of calligraphers.Sami Efendi who could write in all six styles of calligraphy known as Aqlām al-Sitta, has hundreds of known or unknown celi plates. Among these, especially the writing patterns found in the Topkapı Palace Museum Library, GY 4, GY 98 and GY 81 have attracted the attention of everyone working in this field. These writing patterns are important in that they came out of the hand of the calligrapher himself. However, the fine or rough corrections he made in his works show his artistic adventure that continued for half a century.In this study, the writing patterns stages of a script were examined, and the differences between the works were pointed out by making aesthetic analyzes on the celi thuluth scripts of Sami Efendi, which were preserved in Topkapi Palace Museum Library. The writing patterns examined are important and indispensable models for those who are engaged in calligraphy. It is possible to count the works of the calligrapher, especially in his last years, among the masterpieces of calligraphy.

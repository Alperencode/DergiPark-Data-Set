Özet: Among the different babs of the hadith such as faith, jihad, prayer, zakat and irtidat, it is often mentioned that "I am commanded to fight with people until they say that there is no god but Allah. Whoever says that there is no god but Allah, with the exception of the right of Islam, will protect his property and his life from me. Their calculations are up to Allah" will be taken from the first sources as much as possible and the sened chain diagrams will be drawn up by taking the different variants of the hadith from the first sources and the sened chain diagrams will be made, then the status of the narrators in terms of jarh and ta'dil will be determined and the evaluation of whether the deeds of the narrations are merfû, mevkuf, maktu and health will be determined and the text will be criticized in the second part.

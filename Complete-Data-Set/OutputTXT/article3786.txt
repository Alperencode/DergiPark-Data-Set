When the literature about the applications carried out in distance education is examined, it is possible to come across many studies. This study differs from other studies by taking the content of the Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge course as a subject. The main problem of this study is to determine the problems experienced by teachers during the pandemic process, during the processing of Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge course curricula, and the solution suggestions for them. Thus, it is aimed to contribute to the program development studies by identifying deficiencies.This research, in which the qualitative research model was adopted, was carried out with the case study design. In the research, the problems and solution proposals experienced in religious teaching practices carried out during the pandemic process were tried to be examined in depth in line with interviews with teachers. As a result, the content of the Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge course curriculum, on the one hand, has some contributions, such as the emphasis on cleaning habits for the problems encountered during the pandemic process, the teaching of values but it has been found that it is also difficult to have a time problem, to activate students, to use materials, subjects such as measurement evaluation.

Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between University Students’ Leisure Attitudes and Leisure Boredom
Özet: This study aims to ascertain (i) the relationship between and (ii) the differences in participants’ leisureattitudes and leisure boredom. The study sample consisted of 251 university students—132 males and 119females—enrolled in Istanbul University–Cerrahpaşa’s Faculty of Sport Sciences selected through purposefulsampling. The Leisure Boredom Scale (LBS) (Iso-Ahola & Weissinger,1990), adapted into Turkish by Kara etal. (2014), and the Leisure Attitude Scale (LAS) (Ragheb & Beard, 1982), adapted into Turkish by Akgül andGürbüz (2011), and a personal information form were used to collect data for the study. Both a MANOVA andPearson’s correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data collected. The MANOVA analysis revealedthat gender and welfare status had a statistically significant effect on the sub-dimensions of both the LAS andLBS. We furthermore found a negative, low-level relationship both with the subscales of LAS and with theboredom subscales of LBS as well as also a positive, medium-level relationship with satisfaction. As a result,we found that scores on the LAS and LBS differed by participants’ socio-demographic characteristics. Finally,we found a negative, low-level relationship between participants’ leisure attitudes and boredom.

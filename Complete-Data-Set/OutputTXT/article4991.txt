Makale Başlığı: A STUDY ON EFFORTS OF THE USA TO PROMOTE TURKIYE AND THE TURKISH PEOPLE: A POCKET GUIDE TO TURKİYE
Özet: Leaving behind a two-century history, Turkish-American relations have revealed a cultural exchange as a result of the fact that the two countries exchanged military personnel after Turkiye became a member of NATO. In this regard, this study examines and analyzes the work A Pocket Guide to Turkey published by the Information and Education Division of the the USA Department of Defense in 1953 to inform American personnel working in Turkiye about the Turkish People, Turkish culture and Turkiye as a whole. In fact, this Guide has been prepared to ensure that the military personnel who will serve in Turkiye and the USA public in general know Turkiye and the Turkish People closely with all their cultural characteristics, and thus prevent a crisis that will arise due to misunderstanding in Turkiye. Guide has also made efforts to ensure that USA personnel become cultural ambassadors during their stay in Turkey with its inculcations aimed at Americans. The study analyzes the determinations and views of the USA people towards the Turkish People and Turkish culture in a period that will be considered very important for Turkish-USA bilateral relations and analyzes the image of the Turkish People in the eyes of the USA.

Makale Başlığı: A GROUP OF SCYTHIAN ARROWHEADS FOUND IN THE RİZE MUSEUM
Özet: According to the information we have obtained from written and archaeological sources, Cimmerians and Scythians, known as warrior mounted tribes, started to enter Anatolia through the Caucasus since the 8th century BC. These tribes, who first encountered the Urartians in Eastern Anatolia, entered into political and military struggles with the Assyrian, Phrygian and Lydian states. Cimmerians and Scythians, who found their place in the written documents of these states, also left various archaeological materials behind. One of these materials is the arrowheads, which are the subject of the study and known as "Scythian Type". A group of arrowheads, which is one of the archeological data showing the distribution area of the Cimmerians and Scythians in Anatolia, is also registered in the inventory of the Rize Museum. Some of these arrowheads, some of which are known to have come from Tokat/Zile, are also unknown. These arrowheads were brought to the Rize Museum by purchasing. In the study, 12 Scythian arrowheads in the Rize museum were basically cataloged, its typology was examined and its analogy was made with other Scythian arrowheads in Anatolia.

Makale Başlığı: Big Questions of AI in Public Administration and Policy
Özet: Technological advancements have created notable turning points throughout the history of humanity. Influential transformations in the administrative structure are the result of modern technological discoveries. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and algorithms now affect daily lives, communities, and government structures more than ever. Governments are the main coordinators of technological transition and supervisors of the activities of modern public administration systems. Hence, public administration and policies have crucial responsibilities in integrating, governing, and regulating AI technology. This article concentrates on the big questions of AI in the public administration and policy literature. The big questions discussion started by Robert Behn in 1995 draws attention to the big questions as the primary driving force of a public administration research agenda. The fundamental motivation of the big questions approach is shaped by the fact that “questions are as important as answers.” Integrating AI into public administration and the policy-making process allows numerous opportunities. However, AI technology also contains multiple threats and risks in economic, social, and even political structures in the long term. This article aims to identify big questions and discuss potential answers and solutions from an AI governance research agenda perspective.

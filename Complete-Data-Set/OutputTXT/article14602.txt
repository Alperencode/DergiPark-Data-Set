Makale Başlığı: The Space of the City in the Novel Season of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih
Özet: This study deals with place regarding the city in Tayeb Salih’s novel Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shamâl [Season of Migration to the North], wherein the researcher discusses the term of space in general and place in particular with regard to the novel. This study aims to understand the terms of and boundaries between place, space, and city; to disclose the inner and outer spaces of the city in this novel; and to analyze the relationship between the space of the city and other narrative elements (time and characters). This study is divided into three parts: the first topic is the places in the novel, the second topic is the space of the city during the migration season to the north, and the third topic is the relationship the space of the city has with both elements time and characters in the novel. The study relies on the analytical descriptive approach and its mechanisms starting from the lexical level in order to reach the semantic level regarding the study of the city’s space. As for the research results, the most important involve the simultaneous interest in the internal (home) and external (alienation) places. The author was able to confirm the idea that the place belongs to its inhabitants, so the dialectical relationship between place and characters was apparent and evident in this novel, with time acting as a retrieval mechanism, always returning with a retrograde movement to the past to bring the story back to its origin and begin again with conflict. The author did not fail to establish a close relationship between the place and the woman, including all the manifold connotations, with some describing laying down roots, belonging, and homeland; others suggesting identification and similarity; and others still expressing negation and hostility. All this is in addition to employing place and space with regard to disseminating the author’s philosophy, with place also being made an arena of conflict between the East and West.

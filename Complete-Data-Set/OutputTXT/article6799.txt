Özet: Refugees, who mostly took refuge in their own geographical regions as a result of a war or internal disturbance in the past, have started to take refuge in countries outside of their own regions with the globalization process. Especially the refugees who take refuge from countries where refugee traffic is intense and which can be called refugee factories, first take refuge in countries where they can ensure their life safety. Thereafter it tries to climb up one of the steps in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and passes to developed countries. As a result of all these experiences, the characteristics of the refugee protection, which was previously a regional public goods, has changed. In this sense, the study discusses the process of refugee protection gaining a global public goods on the basis of the refugee movements experienced in the selected wars and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. With the analysis of the data on the refugee movements in the wars examined, it is concluded that the refugee problem and thus the refugee protection should be evaluated as a global public good.

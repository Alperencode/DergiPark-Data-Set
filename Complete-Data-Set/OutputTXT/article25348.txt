Makale Başlığı: THE PROBLEM OF TRANSITION FROM WRITTEN DICTIONNARIES TO VOICED AND VISUAL DICTIONNARIES IN LANGUAGE TEACIN
Özet: In the field of lexicology, there have been important findings in terms of importance of visuality. Because it is impossible to use visuality for all printed words, there are no important improvements. With the appearance of digital system and web-based dictionaries, visual dictionaries have been developed. Besides, new technology makes it possible to support visual dictionaries vocally.  In our research, we will discuss usage of visual dictionaries by investigating the works related to visual dictionaries and how understanding of them can be adapted into Turkish language.Also a visual dictionary arranges animals, body parts, plants, vehicles, etc according to thematic order. Therefore, accessibility becomes easier and disorder resulting from alphabetic arrangement will be removed. With visual dictionaries, people can get what the image stands for and when they want, they can listen to their names using vocal dictionaries. In our research, we will discuss briefly the most efficient usage of visual dictionary in our language classroom and the impact of the processes of language teaching.

Makale Başlığı: Identification of pathogen Mycoplasma species using multiplex PCR from chickens and turkeys having clinical symptoms
Özet: Pathogenic mycoplasmas are agents that cause devastating economical effects on poultry industry in Turkey such are the case for many countries in the world. PCR based molecular methods have been extensively used in recent years. Because isolation procedures are time consuming and serological diagnosis might give false positive reactions because of cross reactions.  The aim of this study is to establish multiplex PCR method that enables to detect Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), Mycoplasma synovia (MS) and Mycoplasma meleagridis (MM) species at the same time and to investigate usage of this method in routine diagnosis of these pathogenic mycoplasmas. A total of 100 swabs taken aseptically from chickens and turkeys which shows clinical symptoms similar to mycoplasma infection were used in the study.  Samples were inoculated into Frey’s medium and DNA extraction was made from these growing cultures. Nine (18%) and 5 (10%) out of 50 chickens were found positive for MG and MS, respectively by Multiplex PCR. Two chickens (4%) were positive for both MG and MS. No specific DNA for MM was detected in chickens. Six (%12), 4 (%8) and 3 (%6) out of 50 turkeys were detected as positive for MG, MS and MM, respectively. While MG and MS were detected together in 12 (%24) turkeys, MG and MM were found in only one(2%) turkey together. On the other hand, MM and MS were detected in 3 (6%) turkeys. None of the samples was found positive for all three species. As conclusion, we demonstrated the presence of pathogenic poultry mycoplasmas in chicken and turkeys in Şanlıurfa. It was also concluded that multiplex PCR is very useful method that detects different mycoplasmas with high sensitiviy in a short time. Therefore, we assumed that this method could be used succesfully in prevention and control of these pathogenic mycoplasmas of poultry.

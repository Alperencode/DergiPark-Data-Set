Makale Başlığı: A Sociological Evaluation on the Urban Case and the Relationship of Urban-Religion
Özet: This study aims to examine the urban phenomenon through different perspectives and approaches of sociologists in the historical plane, by discussing the active role played by cities, which are the natural habitats of civilized people, in determining the characteristics, lifestyles and radical changes of societies. Firstly, it was determined the natural conditions in the historical emergence, development and differentiation of the city and to examine the functional dimension of religion in this process. After the sociological definition of the city was mentioned, the typological city approaches of classical sociologists who analyzed the city by focusing on social change were emphasized. In the light of the unique approaches of the Chicago school thinkers, who see the city as a sociological study object and laboratory, their views on urban development with concepts such as competition, invasion and domination, and the unique approaches of contemporary urban sociologists, who consider urban space as capitalist production processes, the phenomenon of the city has been evaluated in the sociological plane. In addition, it was examined the functional dimension of religion in the relationship between urban space and religion, the urban aspects of religiosity, which is a lifestyle also determined. According to the obtained results, we can deduce that the religious and sociological characteristics of the society have an effect on the construction of the city, as well as the effect of the city on the shaping of the social structure. Thus, this study was examined sociologically within the framework of the urban phenomenon, the relationship between urban development and city-religion and the urban aspects of religiousness, according to different approaches, and prepared by using the documentation technique and the Functionalism paradigm.

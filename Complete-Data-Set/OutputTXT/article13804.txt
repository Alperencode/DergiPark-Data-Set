Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of Disinformation and Bot Accounts Under the Hashtag #Darbeyehayir (Nocoup)
Özet: Existing research on fabricated content on social media demonstrates the use of Twitter as a means to disseminate manipulative content (through bots and other means). This article examines Twitter content under the hashtag #darbeyehayir (NoCoup) and provides information about the spread of online manipulated content, specifically related to disinformation and social bot accounts’ features under the hashtag. This study looks at the content created and posted through Twitter during the failed coup attempt that occurred on 15th July 2016 in Turkey The aim of the study is to examine disinformation content within 10,953 tweets that were disseminated to influence online conversations around the ‘coup’ attempt. The study applies a quantitative approach by using the software programme of Discover Text. Examination of Twitter content at that time showed that the protests following the coup attempt were often reported in the form of disinformation, which includes manipulated and fabricated content. Tweet content that included disinformation demonstrated that Twitter users shared information related to events with no sources or explanation. In addition, the tweets containing disinformation were retweeted by others who probably accepted the disinformation as real. The analysis of Twitter content suggested that bot accounts were likely created to manipulate and deceive Twitter users by spreading false information or news under the hashtag.

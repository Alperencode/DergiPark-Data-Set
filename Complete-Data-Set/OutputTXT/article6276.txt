Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Cold Marination on Some Physical Properties and Nutritional Composition of Sardine (Sardina pilchardus)
Özet: In the present study, it was aimed to determine the effect of cold marination on the physical properties and nutritional quality of sardines. For this purpose, pH, colour, crude protein, crude oil, crude ash, moisture, fatty acid composition, amino acid and minerals analyses were made in both raw and marinated sardine (marinated in 4% alcohol vinegar, 9% salt, and 0.3% citric acid at +4 °C for 36 hours). The L* brightness value of sardine increased after marinating. The crude ash content of the product was affected by marination, and the amount of crude protein and crude fat increased (P<0.05). Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and glycine contents of raw sardines increased after marination. In addition, there was an increase in the amounts of all essential amino acids except histidine. Palmitic acid was found to be the most abundant saturated fatty acid in sardines. The oleic acid content of the marinade increased with the marination process. It was determined that the Cd and Pb contents of raw and marinated sardines were below the limit values, and the Hg content of raw sardine was high. According to the results of the study, the marination process increased the brightness of the product, the amount of sweet and bitter amino acids, but it caused a decrease in omega 3 fatty acids.

Makale Başlığı: Deep neural network based m-learning model for predicting mobile learners'  performance
Özet: The use of deep learning  DL  techniques for mobile learning is an emerging field aimed at developing methods  for finding mobile learners' learning behavior and exploring important learning features. The learning features  learning  time, learning location, repetition rate, content types, learning performance, learning time duration, and so on  act as  fuel to DL algorithms based on which DL algorithms can classify mobile learners into different learning groups. In this  study, a powerful and efficient m-learning model is proposed based on DL techniques to model the learning process of  m-learners. The proposed m-learning model determines the impact of independent learning features on the dependent  feature i.e. learners? performance. The m-learning model dynamically and intuitively explores the weights of optimum  learning features on learning performance for different learners in their learning environment. Then it split learners  into different groups based on features differences, weights, and interrelationships. Because of the high accuracy of the  DL technique, it was used to classify learners into five different groups whereas random forest  RF  ensemble method  was used in determining each feature importance in making adaptive m-learning model. Our experimental study also  revealed that the m-learning model was successful in helping m-learners in increasing their performance and taking the  right decision during the learning flow.

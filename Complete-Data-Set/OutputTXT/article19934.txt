Makale Başlığı: A Mughal Princes on the Road to Haj
Özet: The Mughals, which was established in India in 1526, was the third largest Turkish Sultanate and came to the fore with the dynasty women they raised. Among these ladies, who were talented enough to write books and poetry there were even those who joined the path of Chishtism, the foremost mystical movement of the period. The daughter of Babur Shah, known as “Rose Body” stands out with her personality as a poet, author and owner of books, who also appears with different characteristics tried to support her elder brother Humayun Shah in his struggle for power, which was difficult and interrupted for fifteen years. Gulbaden, who showed the same support to his nephew Akber Shah after his death, tried to open the doors for the Mughal Emperor in the perverted religious orientations he was stuck in during this process. Gulbaden Begum, who took part in a colorful and crowded pilgrimage organized for this purpose, reached Jeddah from the Gujarat coast and then Mecca. The way back was painful, and she spent about a year in this Ottoman-ruled city after the ship they had boarded sank in Aden. This chain of events led to comparisons of Gulbaden Begum, and the other Mughal dynasty wives, with Ottoman palace ladies. At this time, the Ottomans sultan's wives were influential in the state administration and this often left the sultans in a difficult situation, while the Mughal women continued their lives with more cultural and social activities. This situation paved the way for the comparison of the two states.

Makale Başlığı: The movement of renew theology in Anatolia
Özet: In the period between organizations and republic, Turkey witnessed a sharp political struggle that was an attempt to advance the Islamic nation, and it was a precursor the downfall that led to it later, represented by the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the fall of many Islamic countries under the political and cultural colonialism. This conflict was motivated mainly by culture between the modernist advocates of renewal affected by the Western revolution, and the conservative innovators, who considered that renewal should be in the curriculum and not in the content.İslamic Theology was one of these fields that were the subject of this discussion, This search dealt with some of the renewal attempts in Anatolia. These attempts did not achieve their right to study and scrutiny and remained marginalized for long periods, even though they nourished religious thought in general and Turkish in particular to this day. The reason for this may be that it was written in the Turkish language and was not translated into Arabic or other languages for researchers in every world to see, so the paper tried to read the reality of the currents of renewal in theology in Turkey, highlight its most important flags and theorists, and evaluate this experience.

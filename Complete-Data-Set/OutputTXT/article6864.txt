Makale Başlığı: THE DEATH IN THOUGHT OF ANCIENT GREEK AND ISLAMIC
Özet: While some civilizations attribute positive meanings to the concept of death, on which various ideas have been produced by many civilizations in history, death has a negative meaning for some civilizations. But the one common point of civilizations is that death is an undeniable reality. Although human beings seek solutions for many issues, this does not apply to death. Because people are vulnerable to death, each individual approaches death from a different perspective. For some, death acts as a bridge to a new life, while for others it is the beginning of nothingness. The individual's perspective on death is shaped according to his belief, culture and age.	The phenomenon of death; When people are associated with the soul and body, philosophy and belief are at the basis of the formation of these ideas. No matter which axis human thought develops, it always needs a philosophy or belief system. Accordingly, in this study, the attitudes of several philosophers in Ancient Greece and Islamic Civilization towards death are discussed. When discussing the idea of death in Ancient Greece, first of all, philosophers who put forward different ideas of death are evaluated. Although there are philosophers of different opinions in Islamic thought, there are no sharply separate ideas as in Ancient Greek thought. As a matter of fact, the philosopher of each period can attribute more than one meaning to the phenomenon of death within the framework of a certain system. Therefore, unlike the philosophers who were parallel to each other during the period, the philosophers whose views were not parallel with each other will be mentioned.

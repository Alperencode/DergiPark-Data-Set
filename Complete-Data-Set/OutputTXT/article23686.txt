Makale Başlığı: The Effect of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the Concept of Private Life and  Its Impact on the Subsequent Human Rights Documents
Özet: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, was drafted by democratic regimes facing extinction as a result of the terrible impacts of WWII in order to defend themselves. Classical rights and freedoms, as well as social and economic rights and freedoms, are regulated by the Declaration, which collects universal human rights in a legislative language. Despite the fact that the document was not legally binding, it served as a model for all following national and supranational documents.In this context, the aim of this research is to use a historical technique to disclose disputes on the idea of private life in the UDHR Preparatory Studies and to highlight the process that has grown into the perception of private life as an umbrella term. Another goal is to show that the umbrella term's general interpretation in subsequent national and supranational human rights documents, as well as the broad framework it provided for the emergence of new rights in later case law, such as the ECtHR, can be traced back to discussions in the UDHR's Preparatory Studies.

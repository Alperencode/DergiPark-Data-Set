Makale Başlığı: Risk factors and maternal/fetal outcomes of pregnant women with abruptio placenta: a retrospective, descriptive study
Özet: Aim: Abruptio placenta is one of the most important causes of antepartum bleeding and is linked to the major (unpleasant) obstetrics consequences leading to the increased risks of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study is to establish a prevalence in our tertiary hospital and find out the fetal and maternal outcomes, along with the patient’s demographic characteristics and risk factors of abruptio placenta. Material and Method: This trial was carried out in Profesör Doktor Cemil Taşçıoğlu State Hospital, between January 2018 and March 2022. Patient data were extracted from computer system, and files were retrospectively evaluated. We established the fetal and maternal outcomes, along with the demographic characteristics and risk factors of abruptio placenta. All analysis was performed using SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 25.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).Results: Within the review period there were 7126 deliveries. And 112 cases with abruptio placenta were seen out of the total deliveries. In our population, prevalence of the abruptio placenta was calculated as 1.5%. Because of the incomplete data in certain files, only a total of 102 cases (91%) were eligible for the study.Conclusion: In conclusion, since the abruptio placenta is highly associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, timely diagnosis is crucial to prevent devastating consequenuces.

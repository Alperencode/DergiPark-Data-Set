Makale Başlığı: Preservice Teachers’ Views about the Use of Mind and Intelligence Games in Education
Özet: Games, which are fun activities, have some benefits for learning environments when used educationally; they play an essential role in children’s physical, mental, social, emotional, and language development. Similarly, mind and intelligence games can improve the cognitive abilities of individuals by improving their basic reasoning and problem-solving skills. This qualitative case study examines preservice teachers' views on the use of mind and intelligence games in education and their effects on individuals. Researchers collected the data using a semi-structured interview guide they developed, through focus group interviews with twenty-seven preservice teachers who were enrolled in and completed an elective course offered at the faculty of education in the fall of 2021. According to the findings, preservice teachers mentioned the advantages and disadvantages of mind and intelligence games according to the type of media. The findings showed that mathematics is a more appropriate course for using the mind and intelligence games, followed by primary school courses, psychological counseling, and social sciences courses. The preservice teachers found mind and intelligence games eligible to support primarily cognitive skills involved in remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Furthermore, co-operation and sociability are the skills that were more frequently referred to by preservice teachers, along with other skills, including persistence, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy.

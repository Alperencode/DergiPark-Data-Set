Makale Başlığı: Combined analytic hierarchy process and binary particle swarm optimization for  multiobjective plug-in electric vehicles charging coordination with time-of-use  tariff
Özet: Plug-in electric vehicles  PEVs  are gaining popularity as an alternative vehicle in the past few years. The  charging activities of PEVs impose extra electrical load on residential distribution system as well as increasing operational  cost. There are multiple conflicting requirements and constraints during the charging activities. Therefore, this paper  presents multiobjective PEV charging coordination based on weighted sum technique to provide simultaneous benefits  to the power utilities and PEV users. The optimization problem of the proposed coordination is solved using binary  particle swam optimization. The objectives of the coordination are to  i  minimize daily power loss,  ii  maximize power  delivery to PEV, and  iii  minimize charging cost of PEV considering time-of-use tariff. In order to determine balance  weighting factor for each of these objectives, analytic hierarchy process is applied. By using this approach, the best  result of charging coordination can be achieved compared to uncoordinated charging. A 23-kV residential distribution  system with 449-nodes is used to test the proposed approach. From the attained results, it is shown that the proposed  method is effective in minimizing power loss and cost of charging with safe operation of distribution system.

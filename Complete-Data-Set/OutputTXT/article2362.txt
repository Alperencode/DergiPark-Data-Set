Makale Başlığı: Fruit and Vegetable Consumption, Attitudes and Knowledge in Preschool Children and Adolescents
Özet: Aim: The aim of the study was compared to the daily consumption servings, attitudes, and knowledge of fruit and vegetable consumption in preschool children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: The study sample consists of 906 participants within two groups including preschool children (n=453) and adolescents (n=453) living in Konya, Turkey. A survey model was used in the study and participants were selected randomized. The data were obtained by a questionnaire consisting of four parts. Results: According to results, 30.9% of the preschool children were found to be overweight and 11.7% obese, whereas 16.3% of the adolescents were overweight and 11% obese. The recommended daily consumption serving (RDS) for fruits was found to be high in both children (98.7%) (p>0.05) and adolescents (95.1%) (p=0.000), but in vegetables it was 26.7% (p>0.05) and 74.4%, respectively (p=0.000). The mean nutrition knowledge score of preschool children’s parents and adolescents was found (x̄±SE) 53.8±0.807 and 36.2±0.508 respectively (p=0.000). Conclusion: It was determined that preschool children and adolescents consumed enough for fruit, but in preschool children the vegetable consumption was low. The fruit and vegetable consumption can be increased by developing healthy eating habits in the preschool and adolescence period.

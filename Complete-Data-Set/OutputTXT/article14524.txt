Özet: Organizational culture is the common values, beliefs and norms that employees share in the organization. Organizational culture guides employees to have the right attitudes and behaviors. Organizational culture leads to solidarity, belonging and integration for employees. Creating a strong organizational culture with this dimension can increase personnel motivation. Personnel motivation is the process of taking the desired behavior and encouraging the individual in line with the goals of the organization. In terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of the organizations, the motivation of the employees should be kept alive. In this context, it is thought that the creation of a strong organizational culture by the managers would positively affect the motivation of the personnel. The aim of the study is to comparatively examine the relationship between organizational culture and personnel motivation in public institutions in Turkey and Afghanistan, and to analyze whether the organizational culture perceptions of the employees' organizations affect their motivation. As a result, it is understood that organizational culture is effective on the level of motivation. On the other hand, it is determined that there is no significant difference between countries in terms of organizational culture and motivation level.

Makale Başlığı: Georg Simmel: An Assessment in Terms of Contributions to the Social Paradigm
Özet: Objectivity on a critical systematic scale and the interpretation of research findings in social psychology are not arbitrary. The researcher's own individual descriptions and the development of specific research method especially in the literature result in references. For Simmel, the rationality of logical thinking requires a special connection in the consciousness of cultural habits between a plane different from practical achievement and voluntary action. The definition of certain phenomena is of pragmatic importance in doing this. Obviously, in order to generate an idea of our topic, it is necessary to limit it. One desired outcome that convinces researchers that reality is a construct is methodological theory discussions. Modeling without introducing assumptions inherent in this respect risks neglecting some of the arguments arising from the dominance of theory in the literal selection strategy. Of course, although there is a lot of evidence for a rich and qualitative study of a topic, the strength of the presentation format adopted is open to many questions. It would not be surprising at the end of the research how sociocultural roles can influence perspectives and move towards moments of reflection. In this article, the social paradigm in Simmel's sociology will be discussed on the plane of extensional of notions and reality.

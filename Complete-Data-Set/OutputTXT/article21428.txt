Makale Başlığı: Experimental assessment of changes of sandy beach profile and sediment   transport caused by tsunami waves
Özet: Destructive solitary (tsunami) waves are capable of   moving large amounts of coastal sediments and causing subsequent   morphological changes in sandy beaches. Experimental studies can be   significantly helpful to assess the process of sediment transport brought   about by a tsunami. The present study is an experimental one that aims to   investigate sediment transport and deformation of sandy beaches caused by   tsunami waves. Waves were generated by a gate wave-producing system to   simulate tsunami waves. Laboratory equipment and mounted cameras were   applied to examine run-up and run-down processes of waves and the beach   profile changes were drawn. The techniques of estimating the transport rate of sediment particles is based on the four traps set in different parts of the beach. The obtained results showed that waves were not capable of transporting the sediment in regions far from the coast where shoaling effects were not considerable. Furthermore, wave breaking point and its distance from each trap have significant effects on the sediment transport assessment of that region. Moreover, the achieved findings indicate that sediment transport that occurred in the run-down of the waves was more effective than that from run-up.

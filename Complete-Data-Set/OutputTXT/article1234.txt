Makale Başlığı: The effect of exercise on the gut microbiome of athletes: a systematic review
Özet: Microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract play an important role in nutrient uptake, vitamin synthesis, energy harvesting, inflammatory modulation and host immune response, and collectively contribute to human health. The role played by exercise, which is one of the formative factors that shape the gut microbiota, and how stress factors and associated factors, especially sport or exercise-specific diet, environment and their interactions, can affect the gut microbiota has been less clear. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the literature on the impact of exercise on the gut microbiota of athletes and the factors that shape it, and to summarize the current knowledge about the factors that shape it. This study is a systematic review and was carried out by searching English indexes from electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science and EBSCOhost) between December 2010 and December 2020. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) was used as the methodology for the systematic search of the electronic database. A total of 14 full-text studies were included in the study. The vast majority of studies show a high correlation between changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota composition of athletes. Reports on the effects of very short-term and medium/long-term exercise programs on the composition of the gut microbiota are inconsistent. Much more research is needed to uncover possible mechanisms by which some of the athletes’ gut microbiome diversity may respond to exercise and in turn affect athlete health and performance.

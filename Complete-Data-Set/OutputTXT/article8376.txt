Makale Başlığı: Salât-ı Dâiyye and Devâiyye
Özet: Salât, which contains many concepts that contain blessings in Arabic; It is possible to define  as "wishing Allah's mercy, forgiveness, blessings and all kinds of goodness to be upon Prophet Muhammad" briefly. Reading the prayer texts, which every Muslim should read in accordance with the religious texts (verses and hadiths), accompanied by music constitutes the "Salât" type in Religious Turkish Music. Salât, which is one of the Religious Turkish Music Types most preferred by the Muslim Anatolian people ıt was performed with great enthusiasm in dervish lodges which are places where Sufi thought turns into practice and in mosques which are places of worship and it has been read in order to sanctify almost every important phase of human life. The great popularity shown to this genre has led to the emergence of numerous Salâts and some of these salats have been recorded and have come to the present day, but some of them were unfortunately forgotten because they could not be recorded. However, there are prayers that have not been recorded yet, although they continue to exist traditionally in many regions of Anatolia, and one of them is the work called Salât-ı Dâiyye ve Devâiyye in the Uşşâk Mode, performed in Elazığ. This work, which also constitutes the subject of our study, is read by the mystic circles (Kâdirîler) in the region.

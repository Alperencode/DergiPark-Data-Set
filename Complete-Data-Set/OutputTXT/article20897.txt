Because it will not be possible to understand themarket without understanding the investor. For this reason, it is extremely important for researchers to know the behavior patterns of theinvestor and, more importantly, to identify the reasons for these behaviors. This study has been prepared in order to guide and assistresearchers who are doing or considering doing research in this field.Methodology- Literature review was conducted in the study. Scientifically defined dictator game, ultimatum game and trust game areexplained in detail.Findings- Literature examples of games that are easy to implement in experimental designs used in the evaluation of the causes andconsequences of financial decisions are considered as findings.Conclusion- The aim of the study is to explain various behavioral games that are relatively easy and highly applicable to scientists who studyinvestor behavior in the research area of behavioral finance. Behavioral games that started with game theory continued with dictator,ultimatum and trust games. Current studies show that the number and quality of these games still continues.

Makale Başlığı: Optimal Control of Automatic Voltage Regulator System with Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer Algorithm-Based PID plus Second Order Derivative Controller
Özet: Optimal control of the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system can improve the system behavior with the optimal parameters obtained based on optimization. The design of proposed Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) and Proportional Integral Derivative Plus Second Order Derivative (PIDD2) controllers are stated as an optimization problem including objective and constraint. The optimization problem is solved by using Coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO) algorithm to find the best controller parameters. In this paper, optimal design of PID and PIDD2 controllers for AVR system are presented with different objectives. The optimal design of controllers modeled as an optimization problem is solved with the help of the CHIO Algorithm. CHIO is inspired herd immunity against COVID-19 disease by social distancing. The performances of CHIO-based controllers in AVR system are compared with some well-known algorithms. Also, the obtained results demonstrate that the CHIO algorithm yields the least objective value in comparison with the other algorithms. When the results of the proposed approach are compared to those of some modern heuristic optimization algorithms, such as the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm etc. and the superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated.

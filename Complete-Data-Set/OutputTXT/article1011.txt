Makale Başlığı: Internal Audit Effectiveness in the Turkish Public Sector: Moderator Effect of Task Complexity
Özet: The purpose of current study is to reveal the effect of internal auditors' independence, professional competence, management support and the number of internal auditors in the organization on the internal audit effectiveness in the public sector. In addition, the moderator effect of task complexity is investigated. Multiple regression analysis was used to reveal the direct relationships between the variables constructed in the research model, and Process Macro 4.0 methodology was used to determine the moderator effect. The findings demonstrated that the independence of internal auditors, their professional competence, and the support received from management are factors that predict the internal audit effectiveness. It was not determined that the number of auditors in the organization had any effect. The findings showed that task complexity had a moderating effect on three variables found to predict the internal audit effectiveness. Within the scope of our study, the characteristics of task complexity at low-medium-high levels are presented. Our findings suggest that in the public sector, the roles of internal auditors can be strongly influenced by different levels of complexity. Therefore, decision makers responsible for improving the internal audit effectiveness in the public sector should determine their policies taking into account the different levels of complexity in different public institut.

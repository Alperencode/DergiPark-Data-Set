Makale Başlığı: Rediscovery of Pearly Tree Frog, Nyctixalus margaritifer Boulenger, 1882 (Amphibia: Rhacophoridae) from Mt. Wilis after 135 years
Özet: For more than a century, pearly tree frog from its type locality (East Indies; Java; Mt. Wilis) are undiscovered. Current studies about the distribution of Nyctixalus margaritifer are reported as known only from West Java and Central Java. In this paper, we collected one individual of pearly tree frog, N. margaritifer in the Western part of Mt. Wilis, which belongs to Gunung Sigogor Nature Reserve, Ponorogo, East Java. This is the third specimen, which is discovered from the Mt. Wilis after the lost holotype in 1882 and the neotype in 1885. Poorly known on its ecology and its habitat preferences makes this frog difficult to find. Here, we provide the specimen description with comparison to former studies based on morphological characters only, its ecology, and its habitat preferences.

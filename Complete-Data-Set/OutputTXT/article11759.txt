Makale Başlığı: A Research on Facade Configuration through Transparency in Architectural Design
Özet: The concept of transparency in architectural design has been on the agenda since the 20th century in interdisciplinary approaches as well as its literal meaning. The article starts with the structural tectonic origins of architecture and makes an intellectual, perceptual, and historical questioning of the covering and façade/surface forming elements with the concept of permeability. The tectonic, realistic, and phenomenal, imaginary perception of the façade is evaluated in the fields of cultural meaning, visual communication, visualization, and aesthetics from the modern architectural movement to the present day. Thresholds and levels are determined in the historical background. Through the material construction of the Facade/Surface and its intangible artistic perception in architecture, the relationship between form and content is opened to strategic discussion.

Makale Başlığı: Synthesis and biological activities of new hybrid chalcones with benzoic acid ring
Özet: A series of E-4-(3-oxo-3-(substituted)prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoic acid derivatives (1-5) were synthesized by the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of various ketones with 4-formylbenzoic acid. The anticholinesterase (AChE and BChE), tyrosinase, and urease inhibition activities of the synthesized compounds (1-5) were examined. It was found that the most active compound against AChE enzyme in anticholinesterase inhibition activity was compound 1. Compound 4 was the most active compound in tyrosinase inhibition activity, while compound 3 was the most active compound in urease psychological activity.

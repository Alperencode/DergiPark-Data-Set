Özet: In this study, it is aimed to determine the self-efficacy concerning the field knowledge in Mathematics of the pre-service teachers. Primary school teachers working in different regions of our country and pre-service teachers form the target population of the study. 100 primary school teacher candidates and 42 primary school teachers that work in the different areas of Turkey, 142 people in total, form the sampling of the study. When the self-efficacy concerning the field knowledge of the teachers is analyzed, they mostly state as “I’m considerably qualified.” It has been determined that pre-service teachers have high competencies in basic concepts and generalizations in their fields. In today's education system, classroom teachers and branch teacher candidates need to know all the concepts, principles and generalizations in their subject areas and start their profession more ready. In regard to the findings obtained from the research conducted, the foundations that train teachers in accordance with the fields that the pre-service teachers think themselves as inadequate based on their perceptions must review their programs. The contents of the lessons that are lectured in the foundations that train teachers must be organized according to the qualifications of a teacher. During their pre-service training, the applications that promote taking part in social and cultural activities, conferences and seminars must be performed.

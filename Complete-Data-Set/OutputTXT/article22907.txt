Makale Başlığı: MAHATHIR MOHAMAD’S ROLE IN MANAGING ETHNIC PLURALISM AND MAINTAINING POLITICAL STABILITY IN MALAYSIA
Özet: When looking at ethnic pluralism, we find that it is one of the most important factors that affected the lives ofnations and peoples during different historical stages. It represents a double-edged sword, because on the onehand, we find that it could be one of the most dangerous sources of threats facing the multi-ethnic state, as itmay become the beginning of internal divisions that threaten the national security of the state and it may reachthe point of wars that may lead to the collapse of the entire country, the impact of ethnic pluralism may extendbeyond the borders of the state and be a source of threat to other surrounding communities. On the other hand,ethnic pluralism may be a source of state cohesion and strength. This happens if the state manages to direct thisdifference between these ethnicities to achieve cohesion between societies, and if the state seeks to establish thestate on the basis of cooperation and spreading the spirit of citizenship and national unity among all spectrumsof society. This is what the political leader Mahathir Mohamad was able to achieve in Malaysia. He was able tounite the multi-ethnic Malaysian state, he was also able to make the ethnic diversity in Malaysian society a toolfor the progress of the state and the achievement of development and political stability in it. This article assumesthat the political leader Mahathir Mohamad had a role in managing ethnic pluralism and achieving politicalstability in Malaysia, which the article will seek to test the validity of this claim.

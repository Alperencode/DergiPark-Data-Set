Makale Başlığı: The Life and Activities of Diyarbakir Deputy Pirinccizade Feyzi Bey
Özet: In this paper, the life and activities of Pirinccizade Feyzi Bey, one of the most famous members of the Pirinccizade family, one of the well-known families of Diyarbakir, were discussed. Feyzi Bey first appeared on the political scene in 1909 by being elected to the Parliamentary Assembly in place of his father after the sudden death of Feyzi Bey’s father Pirinccizade Arif Bey. Afterwards, Feyzi Bey, who was a deputy of Diyarbakir between 1909-1927 without interruption, took place in both the Ottoman Parliament and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and served as the Minister of Public Affairs in the first Republican Governments. After the Second Term of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Feyzi Bey could not take part in the parliament again until his death. In this study, the life story method was preferred and Feyzi Bey's life and political activities were evaluated in this context. The aim of the study is to reveal the activities of Feyzi Bey, who was a deputy of Diyarbakir for many years, who took part in both the Ottoman Parliament and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and who made important studies, especially in the last year of the National Struggle and the first years of the Republic of Turkey. The references of this research are the records of the Ottoman Assembly and of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the Ottoman Archive, the Republican Archive, and local and foreign periodicals. The most important possible findings of the study are to contribute to the work to be done about the TBMM and Diyarbakir and to reveal the contributions of Feyzi Bey to the reconstruction of the country during the establishment of the country.

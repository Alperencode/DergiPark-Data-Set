Makale Başlığı: Counting and Classification of Seed Using Machine Learning Methods
Özet: Deep learning, machine learning and image processing techniques have become important tools used in facilitating agricultural work and developing solutions to different problems in the production phase. In this study, a seed number and type detection algorithm was developed using YOLO deep learning architecture, a real-time object detection algorithm employing the CNN structure in AugeLab Studio sofware. With the developed model average loss factor of 0.417 was achieved after 3000 iterations. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that the bean classification accuracy varies between 97% and 100%, while the chickpea classification accuracy varies between 91% and 100%. In addition, the total number of 11 beans and 10 chickpea seeds in a single image was determined with 100% accuracy. The results demonstrated that AugeLab, a software employing artificial inteligence based image processing techniques, can be used by seed production companies, agricultural biotechnology laboratories and seed certification institutions in counting and classification of seeds. It can also be used in variety and/or species separation, separating and detecting germinated seeds, or detecting and proportioning foreign mixtures in seed certification processes within shorter time and less costs.

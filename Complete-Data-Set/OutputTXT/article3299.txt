Makale Başlığı: Comparative study of harmonic scalpel haemorrhoidectomy versus
conventional (Milligan and Morgan) haemorrhoidectomy
Özet: Background: Haemorrhoids are dilated veins occurring in relation to the anus. There are various treatment modalities for haemorrhoids and among them surgical treatment is considered to be most effective one. Material and Methods: The aim of our study was to compare harmonic scalpel (HS) haemorrhoidectomy with conventional (Miligan and Morgan, MM) in terms of various intraoperative and postoperative factors for the treatment of grade III and IV haemorrhoids. Results:  In our case study of 25 patients (HS group) average time taken was 17.68 ± 2.84 minutes, while it was 28.44 ±3.69 minutes in control (MM) group. The mean blood loss was 8.96 ± 2.15 ml, 31.72 ± 3.28 ml in the case and control group respectively. Postoperative pain with VAS in HS group on the first postoperative day was 5.92 ± 0.72, while it was 8.52 ± 0 in the MM group. The dose of analgesia was less in HS group. The postoperative wound site soakage was less in HS study, early ambulation and return to normal work was faster in case study group. Conclusion: HS haemorrhoidectomy is a simple, bloodless, safe and effective procedure in terms of blood loss, postoperative pain early return to routine work because of less lateral thermal injury

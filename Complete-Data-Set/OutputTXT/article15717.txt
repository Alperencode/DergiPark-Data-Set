Makale Başlığı: ARCHAEOLOGY MEETS LOCAL NEEDS? EXPERIENCES OF THE PERGAMON EXCAVATION IN INTENSIFYING LOCAL AWARENESS OF CULTURAL HERITAGE AND ITS PROTECTION
Özet: Can archaeological excavations play a role in the development of the local region? How can archaeological teams make all the intense field work, conducted with limited budgets in limited time frames, and all the scientific outcomes beneficial for the local community?Ancient city of Pergamon and its surrounding have been subjects to archaeological excavations and investigations since more than 140 years. With a long history and experience, since 2018, Pergamon Excavation has been actively participating the cultural heritage projects that primarily target the local community.As a result of inscription of Bergama on the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 2014, central and local authorities have become aware of the cultural heritage and sensitive about its protection ever since. However, a sustainable heritage protection policy can not be achieved unless the local community is actively involved. Basing on this argument, the Pergamon Excavation has designed a capacity building project and implemented between 2019-2021, focusing the protection of cultural heritage together with the local community. This article explains dynamics of the social environment, from where the project has evolved and describes components of the project, in detail. Moreover, outcomes are comprehensively discussed, as a lookback on a three years of intenser interaction with the local community.

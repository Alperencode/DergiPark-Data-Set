Makale Başlığı: Unfair Termination of the Fixed-Term Employment Contract in its Duration Period within the Framework of Supreme Court
Özet: Although it is claimed that the employment contract is terminated by the employer or the employee on the basis of just causes, if there is no such reason in reality or if the right of termi-nation is not exercised within the period of forfeiture, or if it is not duly made, it is considered as wrongful termination. In employment contracts for a definite or indefinite period, wrongful ter-mination can be made by the employer or employee. The legal consequence of the termination of employment contract for a definite period by the employer before the expiry of the term without any just cause is not regulated in the Labor Law. The Turkish Code of Obligations clearly stipu-lates that; this attitude constitutes wrongful termination, it terminates the contract, the worker can claim the amount of wages related to the remainder contract period as compensation and he can also demand wrongful termination compensation if the court decides in that way.

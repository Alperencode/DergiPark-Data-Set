Makale Başlığı: Effects of Global Climate Change on Olive Cultivation and Olive Oil
Özet: It will be inevitable to experience changes in agricultural potentials and cultivated species with the climate changes we live in today and in the future (decrease in precipitation, increase in temperature and drought). These changes in climate are of great importance for the agricultural sector and especially for the olive sector. Predictions of future climatic conditions reveal that perennial crops such as olive trees, especially water, physiological processes, phenological timings, can have serious adverse effects on final yield and quality characteristics. It is reported that these expected increases in temperatures may increase the length of the growing season in olives, may lead to changes in phenological timings, especially in flowering, and that higher temperatures and increased evaporation will accelerate fruit ripening, revealing the need for early harvest, albeit at lower maturity levels. Depending on these, it is stated that it may cause negative effects on fruit yield, table olives and olive oil quality. There is an urgent need to make forward-looking plans due to climate change. Regarding climate change, it should be focused on how the behavior of olive varieties will depend on these conditions and projects should be done. In the selection of new olive varieties; Criteria such as resistance to diseases and pests, resistant to high temperatures and drought, quality and antioxidant properties of table and oil olives should be taken into consideration.

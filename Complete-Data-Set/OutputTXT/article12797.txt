Makale Başlığı: Gazi University Campus Information System Design and Integration with GIS
Özet: Universities play an important role in producing, sharing and spreading knowledge. These institutions where different disciplines coexist, besides educational activities, research and development, management, housing, maintenance and repair, etc. are social and cultural centers that contain units in their structure. Sustainability of all activities requires a regular system infrastructure. This study consists of collecting data and combining them in the system infrastructure that using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) infrastructure to analyze the verbal, numerical, graphic etc. necessary for the spatial information to be accessible and questionable. In this study carried out on the Gazi University Beşevler campus, each point (buildings, trees, roads, social facilities, etc.) was measured in coordinates by establishing a polygon network in the campus area. The digital maps created after the measurement processes and all data collected from the research area were associated with thematic maps, and the GIS system infrastructure was created. As a result, in the future regulations of the University, it is aimed to create a GIS-based campus information system infrastructure that will allow querying of information and documents, accessing existing information from a single point, and making desired inquiries and analyzes.

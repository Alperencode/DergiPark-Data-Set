Makale Başlığı: Turkish Newspapers Wildfire Coverage During the Summer of 2021
Özet: In this article, some of the assumptions commonly put forward in media research about wildfires and disasters will be examined byexploring how the 2021 fires in Turkey were framed in newspapers with differing editorial and political views. Within the scope of thisreporting, the discussion will centre on how these reports of fires, omitted any mention of climate change and its impact on these disasters.Media organizations evaluate disasters through the lens of their geographical and national positions as well as power relations, withoutassociating them with global events such as climate change. The media in Turkey covered the fires within the framework of their currentpolitical and social conflicts. This situation has seen newspapers deliver news focused on extinguishing fires, post-disaster responsediscussions and 'last minute' developments, instead of offering solutions on climate change and the implementation of mitigation oradaptation policies. In this research, through the use of frame analysis method, the approaches and the actors that newspapers representedwhile covering wildfires are analyzed. In the next phase, news frames are studied whether they are oriented to reveal the causes of thewildfires (diagnostic) or to propose solutions (prognostic) regarding firefighting or climate adaptation policies. The publication whichprovides most solutions, referred to solutions in 14,2% of all its news. Regardless of their political views all newspapers in the samplegenerally proposed solutions regarding the recovery process rather than proactive or preventative climate adaptation policies.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Use on Carbapenem Resistance in Enterobacteriaceae Species
Özet: Objective: Carbapenem resistance in bacterial species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae famil has become an increasingly important health problem worldwide. We aimed to investigate the effect of broad-spectrum antibiotic use on the development of carbapenem resistance.Methods: A total of 82673 patients whose culture samples were sent to the microbiology laboratory from various polyclinics of our hospital between January 2019 and August 2021. Those with Gramnegative enteric bacterial growth in their cultures and those with carbapenem-resistant Gramnegative enteric bacterial growth in their cultures were recorded.Results: The patients included in the study consisted of 71 (56.8%) females and 54 (43.2%) males. Of 125 patients, 91 (73.1%) had a history of antibiotic use in the last 12 months. Carbapenemresistant Gram-negative enteric bacterial growth was detected in the culture of 125 (33.2%) of 376 atients. Among the patients with a history of broad-spectrum antibiotic use, the ratio of those with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial growth in their cultures was significantly higher than those without a history of antibiotic use (0.19% vs. 0.05%; p<0.001). It was determined that the risk of developing carbapenem resistance increased by 3.49 times in those with a history of antibiotic use (Odds ratio =3.49; 95% CI: 1.92-6.33).Conclusion: The results obtained in our study indicate that broad-spectrum antibacterial use may be associated with the development of carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Detailed studies will provide important information for a clearer determination of this possible relationship.

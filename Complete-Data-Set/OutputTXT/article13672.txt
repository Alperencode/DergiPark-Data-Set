Makale Başlığı: COLLABORATION IN ART: COLLABORATIVE PRINTMAKING WORKSHOP AND MASTER PRINTER
Özet: Printing dates back to pre-written history, in the beginning it was only a means of reproduction,in time, it took a place among the means of artistic expressions with its artistic use. Printmaking, which formsthe basis of graphic arts, requires serious technical knowledge and workshops with high installation andoperating costs. This makes printmaking inaccessible to many artists by leaving it a very traditional means ofproduction. The idea of the collaborative printmaking workshops with master printer accompaniment, hashad a serious impact on the production of contemporary prints in printmaking. For the artists who do nothave sufficient technical knowledge and skills in printing techniques or who do not have access to printingworkshops; collaborative printmaking workshops with master printer accompaniment are institutions whichallow artists from different disciplines to produce works in the field of printmaking. Throughout history,collaborative printmaking workshops helped revealing the true potential of printmaking and contributed tothe transformation of printmaking into a contemporary means of expression by getting rid of its traditionalattitude. In this article, the roles of the collaborative printmaking workshop and the master printmaker areexamined while the working models of collaborative printmaking workshops are being discussed. The articlealso discusses how the printmaking can earn a function in the contemporary art market.

Makale Başlığı: Prevalence of Nosema and Amoeba Infections in Beekeeping Farms in Hatay Province
Özet: Nosemosis is a dangerous and contagious disease that affects the digestive system of adult honey bees, causes bee losses, and is common in the world and in Turkey. Amoebiasis caused by Malpighamoeba mellificae does not lead to serious problems in strong colonies alone. However, when it progresses with nosemosis, it may cause significant losses by increasing the virulence and mortality of the disease. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the prevalence of nosemosis and amoebiasis diseases by microscopic method in beekeeping enterprises in Hatay province. The study, in which the majority of the samples were composed of mobile beekeeping enterprises, was carried out in the spring of 2021. In the study, adult worker bee samples were collected from 343 hives in 62 beekeeping enterprises in 4 districts of Hatay province. According to the results of the microscopic examination, the rates of Nosema spp., M. mellificae and mixed infections in beekeeping enterprises were 21%, 15% and 29%, respectively; and they were determined as 17%, 5% and 8% in the hives in these enterprises, respectively. As a result, nosemosis and amoebiasis diseases were detected in 65% of the enterprises in Hatay, in 30% of  the hives of these enterprises. Although Nosema spp. and M. mellificae infections, were observed together in this study, the absence of significant clinical symptoms and bee losses, led to the conclusion that it would not pose a serious risk in resistant colonies.

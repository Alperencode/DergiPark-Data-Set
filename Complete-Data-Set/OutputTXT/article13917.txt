Makale Başlığı: A Western Title Used In The Seljuks: Kondistabl
Özet: Western Christians, the direct relations of whom with the Seljuks, started with the Crusades at the end of the XI. century, continued uninterrupted until the collapse of the Turkish Seljuk State. It should not be overlooked that Western Christians, who are generally referred to in the literature as Christian Latins or Crusaders, have not only military relations with the Seljuk Turks, but also diplomatic, economic, social, religious and cultural aspects. It is understood that diplomatic, commercial, political relations have laid the foundations of this cultural interaction. Furthermore, although the Western Crusaders have remained in the regions such as Cukurova, Antakya, Maras and Urfa along with the Crusades, the traces they left, especially the defensive castles, were rather in the architectural realm. As a result of these intense contacts between the Westerners, who are usually called Franks in Turkish-Islamic sources, and the Seljuk Turks, it is seen that some cultural interactions, although not decisive, took place. Throughout the XIIIth century, due to the mutual contact and interaction, we come across the name Kondistabl, a title of Western origin, in the Seljuk State organization. In this research, we will try to determine under what conditions the title of "Connetable" of the Westerners was adopted by the Seljuk Turks, for whom and for what purpose it was used.

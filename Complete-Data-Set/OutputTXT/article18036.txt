Makale Başlığı: The Role of Flatness Index of Inferior Vena Cava in Early Hypovolemic Shock Concerning Blunt Torso Trauma Patients
Özet: AIM: Our aim is to evaluate the role of flatness of index of Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) with early hypovolemic shock in blunt torso trauma patients.MATERIAL AND METHOD: In the computed tomography (CT) scan, patients with flatness index below 2 were considered as flat IVC patients, and those with 2 or more were considered as non-flattened IVC patients. Demographic data, comorbidities, trauma mechanism, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), lactate level, base excess, shock index (SI), clinical outcomes within 24 hours, and mortality of the flat IVC patients and non-flattened IVC patients were compared. RESULTS: 116 (30.6%) were found to have a flat IVC and 263 (69.4%) patients were found to have a non-flattened IVC. There was no significant difference between flat IVC patients and non-flattened IVC patients in terms of age, gender, comorbidity, and trauma mechanism (p>0.05). Flat IVC patients had a higher SI of 0.9 and above (p<0.001). ISS of flat IVC patients was higher (p<0.001). There was no difference in GCS score between patients with a flat IVC and patients with a non-flattened IVC (p>0.05). Lactate level was found to be higher in flat IVC patients (p<0.001). Base excess in flat IVC patients was found inferior to that of non-flattened IVC patients (p<0.001). Volume replacement, operation, hospitalization, and hospital mortality were higher in patients with flat IVC (p<0.001). A negative correlation was found between the patients' flatness index of IVC and, lactate level and ISS (r=-0.353 p<0.001; r=-0.702 p<0.001, respectively), and a positive correlation was found between the base excess. (r=0.656; p<0.001).CONCLUSION: In the initial CT scan of blunt torso trauma patients, the flatness of the IVC index is associated with early hypovolemic shock. The flatness of the IVC index can be used as a guide in the evaluation of intravascular volume in these patients.

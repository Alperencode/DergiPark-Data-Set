Makale Başlığı: Is the Appeal Court a New Supreme Court?
Özet: The biggest criticism leveled against the appeal law, which was included in Turkish law as a result of long discussions, is the criticism that theappeal has turned into an Supreme Court authority. The reason for thiscriticism is that the appeal, which is based on the need for re-examinationof a decision by a higher court, turns into a tool of legality control overtime, as the legislator also expresses her will in different ways. The question of whether the appeal has turned into a new Supreme Court can onlybe answered after examining the need for the appeal and how and to whatextent the appeal responds to that need. For this purpose, reviews; Thepurposes of inclusion of the appeal in Turkish law are made within theframework of the operational process of the courts of appeal and the placeof the appeal in practice. However, when examining the functionality ofthe appeal remedy, the interventions of the legislator for the integration ofthe appeal legal remedy into the system should not be ignored.

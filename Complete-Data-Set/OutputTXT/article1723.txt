Makale Başlığı: Sensory, Chemical and Microbiological Properties of Trout Sausage (Fermented Sucuk)
Özet: This study aimed to produce fish sucuk using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fillet and inves-tigate its suitability for consumption. Sensory, nutrient composition, fatty acid and amino acid com-position analyses were carried out in the sucuk prepared with a commercial spice mix. Total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total coliform, total Enterobacteriaceae, Lactic acid bacteria, yeast and mould counts were found to be smaller than 1 log cfu g-1. It was found that the ratio of water, protein, fat, ash,  total  saturated  FA,  total  mono-unsaturated  FA  and  total  poly-unsaturated  FA  were  48.63%,  17.27%, 22.00%, 2.52%, 50.17%, 43.23% and 6.6%, respectively. Glutamic acid (19.1 g 100 g-1), aspar-tic acid (17.17 g 100g-1), leucine (9.45 g 100 g-1) and lysine (8.05 g 100 g-1) were the main amino acids in fish sucuk. In addition, the sensory analysis results of the sucuk produced entirely from trout meat showed that it was acceptable. This study concluded that a sucuk product suitable for con-sumption  could  be  produced  using  trout  meat  entirely,  with  the  appropriate  spice  mixture,  heat  treatment and air conditions.

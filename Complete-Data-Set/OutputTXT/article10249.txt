Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between the Quality of The Integrated Reports Published in Turkey and The Firm Value
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the quality of integrated reports published in Turkey and firm value and whether this relationship changes systematically according to firm characteristics. In the study, Integrated Reports published in Turkey between 2016-2020 were reached and integrated reporting scores were determined. In this context, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were applied to the obtained data. The findings show that integrated reporting quality has a significant and positive effect on firm value. According to the results of the study, it is seen that the benefit of the integrated reports to the companies is higher than the cost and that the integrated reporting reduces the information processing costs in the companies with a complex operating and information environment. In addition, it has been determined that companies with higher external financing needs have higher integrated report scores.

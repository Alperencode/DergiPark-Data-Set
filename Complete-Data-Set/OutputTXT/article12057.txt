Makale Başlığı: Planning and Economic Development in Turkey and France: Bringing the State Back In
Özet: The concept of planning in economy is generally associated with the socialist economy model.  Author Vedat Milor, in her work titled Bringing the State Back In, changes the prevailing opinion, and states that planning cannot be considered purely as anti-market, and that market economy and planning can interact with each other. Bringing the State Back In  examines the birth, development and functioning of the planning concept in Turkey and France, and evaluates the future of the planning concept for both countries.  In this book, Milor deals with the adventure of the concept of planning in Turkey and France in the historical process, and examines the reasons why a successful planning can occur in France but not in Turkey.

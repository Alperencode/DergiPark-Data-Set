Makale Başlığı: Nursing Care of the Patient in the Palliative Care Center According to the Henderson Nursing Model: A Case Report
Özet: Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach that aims to improve the quality of life of patients and their relatives as a result of life-threatening diseases. Palliative care is planned in accordance with the needs of the patient and increases the compatibility of the patient and their relatives to the treatment process. Palliative care patients need help in meeting their needs in many issues such as eating, drinking, personal hygiene, mobilization, and social interaction. Nursing care to be given to patients should be planned and dynamic. In this context, nursing theory/models guide nurses in the care process with evidence-based information and enable them to provide quality and individualized care. Virginia Henderson, one of the nursing theorists, emphasizes the helping role of the nurse by focusing on the 14 basic needs of the patients. In this study, the basic needs of a hemiplegic patient who was hospitalized in the Palliative Care Center were discussed with Henderson's Nursing Model and a patient-specific nursing care was presented. This study demonstrates the guiding role of nursing theories in clinical practice.

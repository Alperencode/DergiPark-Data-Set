Makale Başlığı: From Soundness of Memory to Soundness of Text: An Evaluation on the Reasons for the Development of Hadith Taṣḥīf Literature in the IV./X Century
Özet: One of the most important issues for the ideal transmission of hadith texts and isnāds is that there is no error in the writing of these expressions. For this purpose, it is seen that the hadith scholars try to create an awareness about the mistakes in the hadiths and the names of the narrators and try to minimize the mistakes by writing works. The most important examples of this literature seems to have been given in IV. /X century. In this study, the reasons for the increase in the literature of hadith taṣḥīf in the IV./X century will be tried to be analyzed periodically and regionally. When the reasons for this increase are taken into consideration, it can be stated that the main factors come to the fore as the active transmission of works in the relevant period, the development of narrator literature, the decline in the profile of the narrator in this century, and the need of the Ahl al-Hadith living in the ʿAd̲j̲am regions on the subject. It is seen that the hadith scholars’ special requests from Arabic language experts for writing works also affected the formation of taṣḥīf literature. Their display of such an attitude is also important in terms of pointing out the existence of inter-scientific communication and a self-criticism about incompetent fields.

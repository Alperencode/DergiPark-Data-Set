Makale Başlığı: ENTRENCHMENT EFFECTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN TURKEY
Özet: This research aimed to understand the important powers that affect Related Party Transactions (RPTs) decisions. It used the agency theory perspective to examine the effect of corporate mechanism, comprising variables of controlling ownership, the CEOs characteristics, and independent board of directors, on the decision of RPTs regarding potential conflicts of interest.A total of 310 financial reports of Turkish manufacturing listed companies in 2019 and 2020 were assessed. Subsequently, controlling shareholder and CEOs characteristics were discovered to play significant roles in the RPTs mechanism, while the independent board director variable had the highest impact.The strength of the independent board director effect on RPTs decision represents the function of corporate governance mechanisms. Although entrenchment effects occur in RPTs, the denial or approval of independent board directors was dependent on minority interest. It also highlighted the impact of alignment on RPTs’ decision, since the expropriation of ultimate power was balanced within the independent board director’s role.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Effect of Hollow Geometry of Wall Blocks on Heat Transfer
Özet: Hollow blocks have widespread use on building envelopes thanks to their lightweight and high thermal resistance. According to the usage conditions of these blocks, the effects of the ratio, geometry and number of the cavities in the block on the heat flux and temperature distribution should be examined. For this purpose, thermal analyses of the block in the form of eight different inner forms with one row of two cavities and two rows of two cavities in the market and literature were carried out under fixed boundary conditions and steady-state. It was observed that as the hollow ratio increased in the blocks, the air velocity in the cavities increased and the hot air clustered on the upper sides due to the buoyancy forces. This situation caused the inner surface temperature to decrease, the outer surface temperature increased, and %29 more heat flux. When the effect of the number of cavities on the heat flux was examined, it was found that, under the boundary conditions used in the study, the higher the number of cavities along the heat transfer direction, 29% reduced the heat flux. It was determined that the size of the cavity in the direction of the heat flux should be small to reduce the effects of the buoyancy forces, even if the hollow ratio is high or the number of cavities is low in the blocks.

Makale Başlığı: LIABILITY OF E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS FOR DEFECTIVE GOODS
Özet: E-commerce has ramped up all around the world during the pandemic, and it attracts more businesses and customers every day because of its benefits. Simultaneously there is a significant increase in claims arising from defective products put into circulation on giant e-commerce platforms by suppliers/sellers. The number of such claims aiming to establish the damages liability against those suppliers/sellers as well as e-commerce platforms is rising each day. However, as the recent “Çiçeksepeti” case illustrates, the prospect of obtaining a favourable decision for buyers is remote unless every ingenuity is practised.First of all, in today’s world, where national boundaries have so to speak disappeared and products have become accessible from all over the Internet, basing the liability of the big corporations that dominate our economy on the existing domestic policies alone would not offer an efficient way to achieve a realistic solution. At national level, there is no adequate protection for the defective products sold by suppliers/sellers on e-commerce platforms. The legal vacuum with regard to the liability of e-commerce platforms for third-party defective products tend to leave inconsistencies in the protection of citizens. Indeed, the related rules were designed before the digital revolution, before legislative bodies could imagine the consequences of the activities of online marketplaces, and therefore need to be interpreted in a way which would be in line with today’s consumption practices as reflected in some foreign court rulings.The key themes to be addressed in more detail throughout this article are: the consequences of the dramatic shift toward e-commerce due to, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic; the absence of a specific legal framework governing the platform’s intermediary liability for defective products sold by suppliers/sellers; the emerging case law in several countries resulting from the need to fill this gap by means of sales laws and product liability rules; and the blurry boundaries of the safe harbor liability exemption regime for online intermediaries.

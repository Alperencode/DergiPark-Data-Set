Makale Başlığı: Factors Affecting Survival After Mastectomy in Invasive Lobülar Carcinoma of the Breast
Özet: INTRODUCTION: Although invasive lobular carcinoma is the second most common histotype of breast cancer, the prognostic implications of its clinicopathologic characteristics remain controversial. The aim of this study was to identify the factors affecting disease-free survival after mastectomy in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma.METHODS: The records of 68 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma treated with modified radical mastectomy between 2006 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. The effects of age, menopausal status, pathological tumor size, pathological lymph node status, histological grade, pathological stage, lymphovascular invasion, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status on disease-free survival were examined by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 49 months (range 21 to 83). Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 92% and 85%, respectively. One patient had local recurrence (1.5%) and distant metastasis developed in 9 patients (13.2%). Four patients died during follow-up period (5.9%). In univariate analysis, tumor size, lymph node status, stage, lymphovascular invasion, oestrogen receptor status, and progesterone receptor status had significant effect on disease-free survival. Of these, tumor size (hazard ratio [HR]= 6,4; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1,2-21,2; P=0,001) and nodal status (HR= 4,8; 95% CI= 1,1-15,4; P=0,01) were determined as independent risk factors on disease-free survival in multivariate analysis. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Disease-free survival in invasive lobular breast cancer patients who have tumor size greater than 4 cm and positive axillary lymph node is worse.

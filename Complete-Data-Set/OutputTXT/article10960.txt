Makale Başlığı: Abbé Pierre’s Journey
Özet: This  article  is  about  Émile  Zola’s  Three  Cities:  Lourdes  (1894),  Rome  (1896)  and  Paris(1898),  in  which  the  author  describes  the  eponymous  cities  through  the  eyes  of  a  Catholic  priest.  This  trilogy  is  not  only  about  Pierre’s  journeys  and  his  wanderings  inside  the  three  cities,  but  it  also  reveals  his  spiritual,  sentimental,  and  intellectual  path.  The  protagonist  is  marked  by  two  influences:  charity  and  the  need  for  truth  and  justice.  Guillaume,  the  priest’s  scientist  brother  and  his  family  members,  in  time  become  his  role  models.  Women  have  an  important  role  in  this  journey.  First  of  all,  there  are  two  devout  women:  Pierre’s  mother,  who  made  him  choose  the  clerical state, and Marie, his platonic childhood love. Also, two independent women help  him  find  his  real  vocation.  These  are  Madame  Leroi,  the  grandmother  of  his  nephews, and Marie, an educated young girl with whom Pierre will fall in love. The abbot  finally  decides  to  leave  the  cassock.  This  cycle,  which  seems  to  be  forgotten  nowadays,  deserves  to  be  accepted  among  the  great  works  of  Zola  because  it  is  based  on  accurate  documentation  and  it  displays  distinguished  aesthetic  qualities.  Furthermore, Pierre and Marie’s children will be the protagonists of the author’s final cycle of novels, Les Quatre Évangiles (The Four Gospels).

Makale Başlığı: Key Role in China's Development: Integration into World Trade
Özet: After the failure of the traditional import substitution strategy in the 1950s-1970s, many developing economies have turned to a market-oriented trade liberalization strategy called the "Washington Consensus (WC)" advocated by international organizations. Most developing countries, including Turkey, have adopted this strategy, a development prescription that recommends all developing countries follow the same trade policy regime. In contrast, China has integrated into the global market in a new way without surrendering to the Washington Consensus which is called the “Beijing Consensus” by some scholars. Also, China's spectacular economic development stands in marked contrast to the unimpressive experience of many developing countries that have embraced the Washington Consensus. This situation brings to the fore the debates on the reasons for the success of the approach experienced by China and whether it can set an example for other developing countries. In this study, it is discussed how China differs in its approach and the economic reflections of this difference are presented within the framework of some economic indicators. In this regard, it has been revealed that China's trade liberalization reform has created a synthesis by considering its own local dynamics in the integration of the world, and as a result, the trade liberalization policy has been quite successful in economic development. This success has sparked the questioning of the development prescriptions proposed by international financial institutions and developed economies, and even the argument that China's approach will yield better results for developing countries.

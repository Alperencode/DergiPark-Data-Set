Makale Başlığı: LITERARY ACTIVITIES OF KARACHAY-BALKAR TURKS IN THE PERIOD OF DEPORTATION
Özet: In this article, the literary activities of the Karachay-Balkar Turks during the last two years of the 14-year long deportation period are discussed. The Soviet administration wrongly accused them of helping the Germans during World War II and deported the Karachay-Balkar Turks from their homeland of the Caucasus to various parts of Central Asia on November 2, 1943, and March 8, 1944. Karachay-Balkar Turks lived in deportation for about 14 years. Only five poetry anthologies and four private poetry books could be published in Karachay-Balkar Turkish in the last two years of the deportation period. In our study, since these literary works are few, they have been dealt with in detail and one by one. Brief information about the lives of poets and writers in literary works is presented, and examples of their poems that attract attention in terms of content are given. In the conclusion part of our study, a thematic evaluation was made to cover all the works. Until now, this issue has not been given much attention. This is the first time that such a comprehensive study is presented here. The content of these literary works in question is significant in reflecting the mood of the Karachay-Balkar Turks, who had great troubles at that time.

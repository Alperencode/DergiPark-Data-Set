Makale Başlığı: COMPANY SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT DEFINE THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OPERATING IN BORSA ISTANBUL: PANEL DATA ANALYSIS
Özet: The insurance sector has an important role both in Turkey and in the world. While insurance covers the losses incurred by individuals within the framework of certain guarantees, it also makes them feel safe against the risks that may arise. When choosing insurance companies, people pay attention to the opportunities offered by the chosen company and their performance in the sector. Good performances of insurance companies play a role both for the insured and for the development of the sector. Companies need to measure which areas they need to increase or decrease their positions by analyzing their performance. Companies must first identify the factors that affect their performance before performing those analyses.

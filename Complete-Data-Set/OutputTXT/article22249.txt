Makale Başlığı: THE THEORY OF NEODISSOCIATION IN HYPNOSIS
Özet: Although the known history of hypnosis is old as human history, even this day there is no theory that explains the mechanism of hypnosis that agreed upon by scientific community. One of the main reason of this is there is no exact definition of hypnosis that agreed upon by scientific community and hypnosis is still not considered as treatment method by some health care professionals. Thus there is not enough scientific work has been done on hypnosis as a treatment method. At the same time institutions and organizations dealing with hypnosis defined hypnosis according to themselves and they made theories explaining the mechanism of hypnosisover these definitions. Today, it is possible to collect these theories under 3 headings: State, nonstate and neodissociation. Among these theories the neodissociation theory is the one that accepted the most by the scientific community.Our aim in this article is to provide information about the most accepted theory among current theories explaining the mechanism of hypnosis

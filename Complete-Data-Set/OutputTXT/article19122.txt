Makale Başlığı: TERMINATION OF THE TENDER AMENDMENTS MADE THROUGH LAW NO 7343 AND THEIR EVALUATION
Özet: With Law No. 7343, significant amendments were made in the provisions of the Execution and Bankruptcy Law regarding the termination of the tender. In this context, individuals who will make the request are not limited to the persons in the land registry but also the persons registered in the official registry and the limited real rights holders, thus expanding the scope of those who can request the termination of the tender. Regarding for some individuals who might demand the termination of the tender, an obligation to pay a proportional fee, half of which is in advance, has been introduced, and even in the case of rejection of the request, the obligation to pay the remaining fee proportionally has been accepted. In addition, the obligation to provide security for costs of five per cent of the tender price has been accepted for those who have to pay fees. The obligation to pay fees and show security for costs will find application, especially in terms of those who participate in the tender by plowing and requesting the tender's termination. Moreover, these individuals may be sentenced to a fine of up to ten per cent of the tender price if the request for termination of the tender is rejected on the merits or due to a waiver. These provisions and sanctions, which are in the nature of a response provision, can be defended to prevent the misuse of requests for termination of the tender and the procrastination of the tender and enforcement proceedings. But, on the other hand, it can be said that the regulations introduced by the abovementioned provisions are incompatible with the principle of proportionality and constitute a potential obstacle to the right to seek justice and access to justice.

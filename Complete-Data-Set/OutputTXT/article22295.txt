Makale Başlığı: Secondary Infections in Patients with COVID-19 and Review of the Literature: A Retrospective Study Conducted at a University Hospital
Özet: Secondary infections are among the main complications leading to high mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, risk factors, etiological agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of secondary infections that developed in patients with COVID-19. In the study, patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR test who developed secondary bacterial and fungal infections after 48 hours of hospitalization were included. The results of the bacterial and fungal cultures obtained from the clinical samples of the patients were retrospectively evaluated. At the end of this study, it was determined that 16.1% (n=43) of 267 hospitalized patients developed secondary infections. Secondary infections were detected more in males (n=28, 65.1%) than females (n=15, 34.9%) (p=0.024). The median age (65.0 years) of patients with secondary infection was found to be higher (p<0.05). Comorbidity was detected in 93% (n=40) of 43 patients with secondary infections. It was found that 29 (67.4%) of the patients who developed secondary infection were treated in ICU and 14 (32.6%) were treated in the services (p<0.001). Secondary infections found to prolong hospital stay (median 25.5 days) and increase mortality (n=16, 37.2%) (p<0.001). The first three microorganisms identified as causative agents were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=21, 16.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=19, 14.7%) and Candida albicans (n=14, 10.9%). Carbapenem resistance rates of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were 94.7%. While methicillin resistance was found in 100% of coagulase negative staphylococci, no resistance was found to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. No resistance was found to the tested antifungal agents in C. albicans (10.9%) isolates. Among secondary infections, especially pneumonia (n=25, 36.3%), bloodstream infections (n=19, 27.6%) and urinary tract infections (n=18, 26.1%) ranked first. Detection of secondary infections and risk factors associated with COVID-19, identification of causative microorganisms and determination of antimicrobial resistance patterns are very important in terms of prognosis, infection control and antimicrobial management of the disease.

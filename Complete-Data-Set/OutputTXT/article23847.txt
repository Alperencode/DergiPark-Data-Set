Özet: Maritime transport is among the modes of transport used for the movement of people or goods. Transportation is provided with the use of ships and similar vehicles in the sea. Large amounts of goods can be transported by sea at once, which, in turn, increases the preferability of maritime transport in international trade. Maritime transport companies move people or goods by using maritime transport vehicles. These companies face some expenses during the initiation and completion of shipping.

The objective of this study is to explain the maritime transport and also to account the foreign expenses paid by maritime transport companies during the shipping process. With this aim in mind, first of all, a general overview has been given regarding the maritime transport. Then, accounting transactions have been done through a sample of practice regarding the foreign expenses paid by maritime transport companies during the shipping process.

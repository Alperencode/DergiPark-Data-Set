Makale Başlığı: DRUM ZURNA ON THE AXIS OF TRADITION: THE EXAMPLE OF TOKAT
Özet: Drum and zurna instruments are accepted as important instruments of Turkish music tradition from past to present. The local meanings of these instruments, which are observed throughout Anatolia, differ. This study aims to reveal the data on how the changes in technology and urbanization, especially since the last quarter of the 20th century, affect the drum and zurna tradition. In this context, case study design, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the study in order to read the tradition correctly. In order to obtain in-depth information, interviews were conducted with the resource persons determined by the snowball sampling technique. A semi-structured interview form was prepared before the interview, and the data obtained at the end of the interviews were analyzed by descriptive analysis method.The results of the research can be summarized as follows: As a result of practices and concepts, it has been concluded that the drum and zurna tradition has connections with the centuries-old military music traditions. Today, it has been determined that there are various concerns in terms of financial gain due to the narrowing of the execution areas of the tradition. In connection with this, it has been concluded that the master-apprentice relationship has suffered greatly in the last period. Suggestions are given in the context of ensuring the continuity of the tradition.

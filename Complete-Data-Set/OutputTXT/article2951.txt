Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Turkey’s Credit Default Swaps with BIST ‎‎100 Index, Exchange Rate and Interest Rate‎
Özet: In this study, relationship between Turkey’s credit default swap (CDS) premium with the BIST100 index, the exchange rate and the interest rate for the period 2010:04-2021:01 is examined. For this purpose, the Granger causality test was conducted and the causality test displays two-way Granger causality between CDS premiums and the BIST100 index, two variables were determined as a Granger Causes of each other. One-way causality from CDS premiums to exchange rate was found. CDS premium was determined as a cause of exchange rate. As a result of the impulse-response functions, it was determined that a shock in return of BIST100 index caused  a 0.05 decrease in CDS premiums in the middle of the second period. The shock in return of BIST100 index caused a decrease in CDS premium in the middle of the fourth period and an increase in the middle of the third and the fifth periods. A shock in CDS premiums caused a 0.10 increase BIST100 index until the middle of the fifth period. A shock in the CDS premium caused a 0.08 decrease in the interest rates until the middle of the fifth period. According to the variance decomposition, approximately 91% of the change in CDS in the short and long term was explained by itself and 6% by the BIST100 index. While their own shocks caused approximately 65% of the changes in the BIST100 index in the first period, 34% of them were caused by CDS. In the long term, the effect of CDS remained approximately at 39%, the effect of interest remained at 4%. Approximately 68% of the changes in exchange rates were explained by their own shocks, 30% by the CDS and 0.60% by the BIST100 index. Approximately 42% of the recent exchange rate changes were determined by the CDS and 53% by its own shocks.

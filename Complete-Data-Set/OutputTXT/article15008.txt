Makale Başlığı: Does developing research skills increase academic motivation among foreign language learners?
Özet: Abstract Academic motivation is one of the most significant affective factors in the learning of English as a foreign language (EFL). Moreover, research skills can be vital in foreign language learning and teaching processes. However, the number of studies on academic motivation, research skills, and the relationship between the two seems too limited to draw a conclusion. The current study aims to explore whether or how academic research skills and academic motivation are related. In this experimental study, an information test for measuring their knowledge of EFL research and the Academic Motivation Scale were administered to 16 participants before and after the instruction process. The results showed that developing foreign language research skills increases intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation among language learners. It was recommended that issues relating to research skills should be integrated into language course programs.

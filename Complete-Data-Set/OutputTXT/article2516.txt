Makale Başlığı: Elastic Constants of Cedar (Cedrus libani A.) Wood
Özet: In order to make the optimum design of wood material in computer aided design and production systems used today, all elastic constants must be known. Nine elastic constants are needed for the integration of wood which is an orthotropic material into these systems. In this study, elastic constants of Cedar (Cedrus libani A.) wood were investigated at constant temperature and relative humidity conditions. Elastic Constants were obtained from samples of 20 x 20 x 60 mm in compression tests. Three elastic moduli (EL, ER, ET) in principal directions, three shear modulus in the LR, LT and TR planes and six Poisson’s ratios (νLR, νLT, νRL, νRT, νTL, νTR) were evaluated. Compression strength of the specimens in L, R and T directions were also calculated. Strains occurred during loading were measured using bi-axial extensometer. Elastic constants were calculated from the load-deformation curves. EL, ER, ET values determined in cedar wood were 7800, 890 and 670 N/mm2, GLR, GLT, GRT values were 836, 780, 156 N/mm2, and Poisson ratios ranged between 0.052 and 0.522, respectively. The compressive strengths in the L, R and T directions were found as 44.1, 8.6 and 7.6 N/mm2, respectively. Properties found in the study can be used in numerical modelling of cedar wood.

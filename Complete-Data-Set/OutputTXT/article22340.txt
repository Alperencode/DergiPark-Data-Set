Makale Başlığı: Inhibitory effects of some additives on LOX activity in Santa Maria pear puree
Özet: Lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.34.; LOX) enzymes; They are iron carrier dioxygenases that oxidize fatty acids with two or more unsaturated bonds in their structure and do not contain heme groups in their structure. LOXs are found in plants, animal tissues, and cyanobacteria. In this study, the change of LOX enzyme activity in Santa Maria pear puree depending on different concentrations of fumaric acid, syringic acid and rosmarinic acid and cooking process was followed for 7 days. It has been observed that fumaric acid increases LOX activity. This increase was not prevented by the cooking process. It was observed that syringic acid and rosmarinic acid decreased LOX activity day by day, and a faster decrease in activity was observed in the samples that were additionally cooked. At the end of 7 days, it was observed that rosmarinic acid caused approximately 60% inhibition, while syringic acid caused approximately 80% inhibition. Based on these results, we can say that the cooking process with the addition of rosmarinic acid or syringic acid to the medium in order to prevent the loss of taste, smell and flavor of the pear, which is frequently used in baby complementary foods and fruit juices, extends the shelf life.

Makale Başlığı: Planning Nursing Care According to Cognitive Development Theory and Life Model of Child Diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, Osteomyelitis and Epilepsy: A Case Report
Özet: Nursing theories and models aim to make nursing practices within a system and discipline. In addition, it ensures that the patient’s care priorities are determined, the patient is handled and evaluated holistically, and the appropriate theory and care model is used for each patient. For this purpose, nursing care was planned according to Cognitive Development Theory and Life Model for an 8-year-old male patient that is diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy (CP), Osteomyelitis and Epilepsy, by communicating with his mother. It was observed that the cognitive development of this case lagged behind compared to her peers and was insufficient to meet the activities of daily living. For this reason, by integrating Cognitive Development Theory and Life Model, diagnoses related to the needs of the child were made in line with the 12 life activities included in the life model and nursing interventions that could be made were determined. This study aims to provide the information and support they need to children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, Osteomyelitis, and Epilepsy and people who help them in their care, in line with Cognitive Development Theory and Life Model.

Makale Başlığı: 4-Dimensional 2-Crossed Modules
Özet: In this work, we defined a new category called 4-Dimensional 2-crossed modules. We identified the subobjects and ideals in this category. The notion of the subobject is a generalization of ideas like subsets from set theory, subspaces from topology, and subgroups from group theory. We then exemplified subobjects and ideals in the category of 4-Dimensional 2-crossed modules. A quotient object is the dual concept of a subobject. Concepts like quotient sets, spaces, groups, graphs, etc. are generalized with the notion of a quotient object. Using the ideal, we obtain the quotient of two subobjects and prove that the intersection of finite ideals is also an ideal in this category.

Makale Başlığı: The Vocal Suggestions of Tajwīd Rules and Its Effects on Meanings
Özet: The research aims to study the phenomenon of vocal suggestion (the sound revelation) of intonation rulings, by selecting, analysing and studying a number of examples in which the feature of sound suggestion was manifested. The research included a historical study of the views of ancient and modern scholars on this phenomenon, and shed light on the relevance of the science of intonation with the phonetic study. Then it dealt with the phenomenon of phonetic suggestion of the rules of intonation and its impact on understanding the meanings of the Qur’an, by presenting the subject in ten main points, namely the phonics and their qualities, the extension (Med), slurring (Idgam), the silence (Sakt), the Hai’s of Sakt, the Hai’s of Sela, Ravm and Ishmam, the Imalah, the Alef exit and the intonation, Vakf ve Ebtida; Where these rules were defined and represented with appropriate examples from the Holy Qur’an to find out its musical intonation and the meanings it suggests or reflects in the images that are embodied in the mind of the reader and listener. The study was limited to the intonation rules of the narration of Hafs bin Suleiman (d. 180/796) on the reading of Imam Asim bin Abi Al-Najud Al-Kufi (d. 127/745), and the analytical method was adopted in studying the selected examples.

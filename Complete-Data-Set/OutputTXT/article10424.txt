Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of the Impact of Pollution and Pollution of PV Panels in Settlements on Energy Efficiency
Özet: One of the methods of benefiting from solar energy is to convert solar energy into electrical energy with photovoltaic (PV) panels. The energy efficiency of the panels is determined under normal conditions. Many reasons affect the efficiency of the panels in natural environments where there are no normal conditions. Causes such as temperature changes, expansion, corrosion, rain, pollution, wind, inclination angle change the production efficiency of the panel. In the study, the changes in the energy values produced by PV panels according to the environments they are exposed to in and outside the city were examined. The rates of contamination on the panels were examined in different environments and their effects were investigated. It produces energy inversely proportional to the temperature increase on the panel. An increase in temperature reduces production by having an adverse effect after a certain value. The effect of the wind blowing on the panels on the temperature value and additionally the effect on the pollution rate were investigated. With the study, five different regions were determined in the city and outside the city, and the electrical energy production values of the panels with the same characteristics installed in these regions were investigated. The energy production differences between the cleaned panel and the polluted panels as a result of different natural conditions after a certain period were compared.

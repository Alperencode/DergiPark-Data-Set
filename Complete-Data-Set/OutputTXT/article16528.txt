Makale Başlığı: Feed Value of Lycium anatolicum A. Baytop & R. Mill.
Özet: Turkey is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of plant diversity. Lycium anatolicum A. Baytop& R. Mill is endemic shrub species found in Turkey. This plant is grazed by animals as fodder. This research analyzed the dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, ADF, NDF, and TDN on L. anatolicum grown in Ankara and Konya locations. In the study, in leaves of the plant was found to be the crude protein ratio 27.52% /DM, the ADF and NDF ratios were 26.05%/ DM and 31.03%/DM, respectively, and TDN was 58.10%/DM. The results showed that the Konya location (i.e., 64.70%) had a higher TDN value than the Ankara location (i.e., 51.10%). Therefore, it is predicted that this plant with wide adaptation can be used in pasture improvement.

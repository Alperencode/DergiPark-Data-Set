Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Attitudes of Relatives of Terminal Stage Patients towards Death and Principles about Dying with Dignity
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the attitudes of the relatives of terminal stage patients towards death and principles about dying with dignity. Material and Method: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out with 308 patient relatives between 20 December 2021 and 21 March 2022. The data were collected using a “Patient Information Form”, ‘Death Attitude Profile-Revised (DAP-R)’ and ‘Assessment Scale of Attitudes towards Principles about Dying with Dignity’ (ASAPDD). Descriptive statistics, Student t test, One-Way ANOVA test, Kruskal Wallis test, Mann Whitney-U test, Pearson correlation and regression analysis were used to analyze the data.Results: The mean age of the relatives of the patients participating in the study was 34.88±2.32, 86.0% were female. 38.6% of the relatives of the patients stated that the patient in the intensive care unit was their mother/father, and 44.1% stated that the patient stayed in the intensive care unit for 3-7 days. The mean DAP-R total score was 107.30±25.1 and the ASAPDD total score was 30.62±10.70. A positive and highly significant relationship was found between DAP-R and ASAPDD. Conclusions: It was determined that as the attitudes of the relatives of the patients towards death became negative, the level of adopting the principles about die with dignity increased. Health professionals should provide death counseling to the relatives of patients in order to increase the quality of life of patients in the terminal period.

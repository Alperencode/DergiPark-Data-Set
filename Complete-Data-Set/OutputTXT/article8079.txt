Makale Başlığı: Determination Of The Verses Associated With Taqdim-Te’hîr in Tafsir Books
Özet: The literary styles of the verses of the Qur’an are explained in the tafsir books. Presenting the word in impressive styles attracts the attention of the interlocutors, makes it easier to focus on the meaning and leaves them under influence. One of these Qur’anic styles is "taqdim-te’hîr". This literary style is mainly based on the use of inverted sentences. In order to draw attention to attention to correct understanding while analyzing the meaning of the verses, it is stated in the commentaries that "there is taqdim-te’hîr in this verse" and the regular sequence of the sentence is shown. However, commentators are not in agreement on this issue. For some verses, one commentary points to this, while the other does not. Or, some commentators think that the verse should be understood as it is in the Qur’an, and they do not find it correct to interpret the sentence in a different order. For such reasons, it does not seem possible to understand in which verses there is a taqdim-te’hîr only by looking at one tafsir. In this study, taking into account the tafsirs written from the Companions to the present, especially the voluminous tafsirs, it has been determined numerically which verses are the subject of the taqdim-te’hîr. The distribution of the relevant verses according to the suras has been shown and the amount of use of this style in the tafsir books in the historical process is presented with graphics.

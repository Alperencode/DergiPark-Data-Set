Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Ensiling Peach Pulp with Some Fruit Pulp on Nutrient Composition, Energy Value, and Organic Matter Digestibility
Özet: In this study, peach pulp and pomegranate pulp, sugar beet pulp, and tangerine pulp were turned into silage alone. This study was carried out to determine the chemical composition, cell wall components, non-cellulose carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, total carbohydrate contents, gas production, metabolic energy, and organic matter digestibility of silage. Dry matter, raw ash, and crude cellulose ratio were highest in the PP+SPP group, but no statistical difference was found between the groups in the raw cellulose ratio. While the crude protein ratio was highest in the CP+MP group, the difference was not statistically significant. The highest crude oil rate was found in the CP group. The highest rate of ADF, NDF, and ADL was found in the CP group, while the hemicellulose rate was found in the CP+SPP group. The ratio of total digestible food and non-cellulose carbohydrates was higher in the CP+MP group. It was observed that the group with the highest total carbohydrate content was the PP+SPP group. Even though pH occurred in the highest CP group, it was determined that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Gas production, metabolic energy, and organic digestible matter ratio were found to be highest in the PP+SPP group. As a result, good quality silage can be obtained by mixing peach pulp silage alone or with other fruit pulps. It will be possible to evaluate the pulp produced as a result of production in the food industry, to prevent environmental pollution that it will create as waste, to contribute economically, and to be used as a source of roughage.

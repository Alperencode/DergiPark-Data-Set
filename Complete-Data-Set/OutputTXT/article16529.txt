Makale Başlığı: Use of Liquid Product from the Pyrolyzing of Plastic Waste Instead of Commercial Wax
Özet: In this study, pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and aluminum-containing low-density polyethylene (C-LDPE) was carried out at different temperatures, and the use of the liquid product obtained because of pyrolysis in different processes as commercial wax in future studies was investigated. For this purpose, rheology measurement was performed for density determination, melting point determination, carbon residue determination and viscosity determination on liquid product samples. Then, GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) analysis, which is an analytical method combining the features of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, was performed to identify different substances in liquid product samples. After the elements in the sample were ionized in gas chromatography, they were sent to mass spectroscopy, where they were separated into mass/charge ratios, then the necessary measurements were made. According to the test results, While the density and melting point determination values of the liquid product obtained from the pyrolysis of LDPE and C-LDPE plastic wastes were exactly compatible with the density and melting point of commercial waxes, it was observed that the viscosity values were lower than commercial waxes. It was determined that the carbon residue values of the samples were close to the carbon residue values of commercial waxes in the market. As a result, it has been understood in future studies that the liquid product obtained from the pyrolysis of plastic wastes can be used instead of commercial waxes if the impurities are removed.

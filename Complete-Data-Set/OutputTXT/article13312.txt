Makale Başlığı: The Literacy Method in Paulo Freire
Özet: Paulo Freire (1921-1997) was a Brazilian educator and philosopher who showed a keen interest in educational practices from a young age. Confronting the social realities in which he grew up was instrumental in developing his ideas. His childhood, which was spent under difficult conditions due to the economic situation of his family, made him see the differences between social classes at an early age.  The time he spent with agricultural workers and fishermen in his childhood and early youth, the poverty he lived personally, the miserable lives he witnessed, the oppressed and despised people led him to engage more deeply in pedagogical research than in books. Especially since the rate of illiteracy was very high in Brazil at that time, the issue of literacy was very important to him. Because in his view, it’s a great injustice that people cannot read and write, and it contains great injustices. Most importantly, illiterate people stay away from making decisions for themselves, voting and participating in the political process. As this situation preoccupied Freire a lot, he developed a set of techniques for literacy in his own way, through discussions and debates about people's view of the reality in which they live. In a learning method based on reading sentences by heart and trying the letters of the alphabet, he considered using a sentence as a starting point and starting with the integrity of a word rather than starting from a letter symbol. In this article, this literacy method developed by Freire’ll be evaluated.

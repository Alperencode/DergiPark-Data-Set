Makale Başlığı: The Tribual Origins of Ayyubid Administration Organization
Özet: The governing structures of Ayyubids which is a tribal origin dynastic state, seamed with tribal norms. Such tribal doctrines as weak leadership, collective responsibility, nepotism and division of material assets among members are factors that shape general policy of Ayyubid sultans. Dynasty’s success in state-making and political-military processes are attributed to the determinant dynamics that emerged from the same origin. As for the hypothesis of this study, tribal values which presumably contributed to the rise of the Ayyubid, at the same time, brought about direct impacts on the dissolution of the state organization. In the light of rich historical data, the similarity between administrative attitudes of the rulers and tribe-like behavioural patterns are remarked and then it is tried to prove the destructive impact of the mentioned attitudes in the collapse of the dynasty by perpetual crises.

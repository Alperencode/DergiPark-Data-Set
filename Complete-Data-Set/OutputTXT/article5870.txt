Makale Başlığı: The Dualism of inside and outside and the Truth in Harold Pinter’s The Room
Özet: My study aims to explore the cross binaries of inside and outside considering the trajectory of the Lacanian topological figure, torus, in Harold Pinter’s The Room. The intrusion of uninvited visitors problematizes Rose’s logocentric speech that hides her lack behind continuous movements around stage props of kitchen sink drama repeating itself all the time in the play. The intertextu-ality in the play reveals the truth about Rose’s originary identity within myth-opoeic thought, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside. The tra-jectory of torus elucidates energy that situates outside to the centre of the subject and the room, examined in Badiou’s notion of truth, hidden in black, blind Riley’s message to Rose. The study also draws on the notions of subal-tern and the hegemony to broaden the framework of analysis, concluding that the murderous cold of the outside is right at the centre of Rose’s room like a black hole that reflects the blind fortune supported by the chaotic forces in the play. In the play, the duality of inside and outside has been problematized epistemologically and ontologically for the character, so this situation affects the lives and ontic status of the characters.

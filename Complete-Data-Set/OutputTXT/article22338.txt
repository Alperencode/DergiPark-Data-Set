Makale Başlığı: Production and Characterization of Nanotechnological Wound Dressing Containing Ozone Oil
Özet: In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which is very useful for the electrospinning method, was used in terms of its properties such as being easily dissolved in water, easy to spin, and forming qualified nanofiber surfaces. A mixture of 10% by mass of pure water and granular PVA was prepared by weighing on a precision scale. The mixture was stirred at 80 ºC for 3 hours in a heated magnetic stirrer and left at room temperature for 24 hours. The resulting 10% PVA solution was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 30 ºC for 45 minutes by adding 5% ozone oil. 10% PVA, 10% PVA-5% Ozone Oil composites were obtained by electrospinning technique. Morphological characterization of the obtained composites was carried out with Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEGSEM). Membranes that we produce for chronic wounds, especially for diabetes patients, will be ideal material candidates with their rapid wound healing properties.

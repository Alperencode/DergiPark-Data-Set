Makale Başlığı: Dionysus-Eros-Panther: A Terracotta Figurine Inscribed by Diphilos
Özet: With the Hellenistic Period, the development of production in the Terracotta Figurine industry led to the establishment of many production workshops. The clearest information about those workshops can be obtained through the signatures and monograms printed which were stamped on the figurines. The terracotta producers, known as koroplathos in the Ancient Period, were identified especially through the data obtained from the excavations in the city of Myrina in the Aolis region. Among these manufacturers or workshops Diphilos is the most well-known. The terracotta figurines signed by Diphilos can be found in various museums and collections around the world today. The figurine which is discussed in this study, belongs to the İzmir Karaoğlu Collection. The figurine consists of a trilogy that includes the figures of Dionysus, Eros and panther. The central figure, Dionysus, is depicted in a half-naked and feminine style. The nude and child Eros that reflects the Hellenistic style and panther figures are focused towards the main figure creating a pyramidal composition. The same type of figurine group was produced in other workshops besides Diphilos. However, the closest example of this figurine is located in French School at Athens. It is possible that these two figurines were produced from the same mold. From an iconographic point of view, the feminine depiction of Dionysus reveals the androgynous identity of the god mentioned in the ancient literature, and his association with Eros reveals the common mission of both gods in spreading the sense of insanity.

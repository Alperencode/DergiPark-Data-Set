Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Programming Education Conducted Online Synchronous on Associate Degree Students' Attitudes and Self-Efficacy towards Programming
Özet: This research aimed to examine the effect of synchronous programming education in the online learning environment on the attitudes and self-efficacy of associate degree students towards programming. Embedded design, which is included in the mixed research method, was used in the research. The participants consisted of 30 associate degree students studying in the second year of computer programming. While the quantitative data of the study was collected through the attitude and self-efficacy perception scales, the qualitative data was obtained through the structured interview form. After the research, students' attitudes and self-efficacy towards programming increased significantly. Students' attitudes and self-efficacy towards programming did not differ according to gender, type of the high school graduated from and experience variables. Attitudes and self-efficacy of the students were positively affected by the registration of online synchronous courses in the system, the uploading of various course documents to the system, and the absence of negative effects affecting classroom management. The lack of opportunity to practice individually during the course and the lack of instant feedback outside the course are among the factors negatively affecting the attitudes and self-efficacy of the students.

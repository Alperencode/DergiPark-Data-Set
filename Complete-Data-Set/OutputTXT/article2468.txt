Makale Başlığı: RHYTHMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE POLONAISES IN NOTEBOOK FOR ANNA MAGDALENA BACH
Özet: Polonaise, one of the Polish folk dances, has shown a great development in historical process and got an important place in the repertoire of Western Classical Music. Polonaise did not stay limited to Poland. The relation between Poland and other European countries led polonaise to spread and to change with the effects of different cultures. Polonaise can be found among the compositions of German composers since the eighteenth century.     In the album, which Johann Sebastian Bach presented to Anna Magdalena Bach in 1725, there are polonaises among the pieces in various forms. In these polonaises it can be seen that there are other polonaise rhythms beside the characteristic polonaise rhythm (A1a).     In this research, polonaises from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach (BWV Anh. 117a, 117b, 119, 123, 125, 128 and 130) were analysed in rhytmical aspect.

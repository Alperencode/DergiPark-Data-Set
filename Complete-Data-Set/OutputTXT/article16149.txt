Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Cell Phone and DSLR Camera Usage in Point Cloud Generation
Özet: In today's world, maps are now offered to users online in digital form rather than paper printouts. Instead of being a finished product, the maps serve as a foundation for various professional disciplines. In this context, it is critical to produce 3D models more quickly and at a lower cost. Within the scope of this study, a comparison of a DSLR camera (Canon EOS 1200D) and mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) was made in point cloud generation. A high sloped cut slope was chosen as the study area. Based on this framework, 4 different models were produced and these models were tested both with ground control points and with point cloud produced by robotic total station. The dense point clouds created using the Canon EOS 1200D DSLR camera were found to be denser than those created with a mobile phone. In addition, models were tested by calculating Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). As a result of these tests, the best resulting model is the Model 1 obtained with Canon EOS 1200 DSLR, which has ±2.11 mm, ±1.78 mm, ±1.00 mm in RMSE in X, Y, and Z axes, while the worst resulting model is the Model 3 obtained with Samsung Galaxy S6, which has ±22.90 mm, ±33.18 mm, and ±18.53 mm RMSE in X, Y, and Z axes.  According to these results, although the models obtained with the mobile phone camera give worse results, when considering the cost, mobile phone cameras can also be preferred.

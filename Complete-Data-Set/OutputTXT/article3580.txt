Makale Başlığı: A review of Moroccan medicinal plants used in the treatment of  urolithiasis
Özet: In Morocco, surveys on the medicinal plants used in the treatment of urolithiasis have been carried out by various researchers during ethnobotanical missions.The main objective of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of medicinal plants used in the treatment of this disease in Morocco in order to help in the formulation of improved traditional medicines.Data concerning the use of medicinal plants against urolithiasis are extracted from published documents concerning the various ethnomedicinal surveys conducted in Morocco for synthesis and analysis. In total, 82 species of plants belonging to 42 families are recorded to be used by the Moroccan population to treat urolithiasis. Apiaceae, Lamiaceae, Leguminosae and Poaceae are the most represented families. The most cited plant species are Petroselinum crispum and Citrus limon, Atriplex halimus, Apium graveolens, Opuntia ficus-indica and Herniaria hirsute. Several parts of the plant are solicited. Nevertheless the seeds and the leaves are the most used parts. Decoction and infusion are the most common methods of preparation. Morocco has an important floristic biodiversity in terms of antilithiasic plants. These results form the basis of subsequent studies aimed at experimentally evaluating the potential of these plants.

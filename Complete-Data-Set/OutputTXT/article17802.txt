Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Pollution from Bilge Water in Van Lake
Özet: The water pollution caused by the bilge waters of the ships operating in Van Lake was investigated. While on-site measurements were made with a multimeter in the lake water in ten different stations that used as ship havens, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and oil-grease analyses were carried out in the lake water and bilge waters taken from the ships. In the sample waters taken from the lake, the lowest and highest COD values were 32 and 240 mg/L, respectively, and the lowest and highest oil-grease values were 23 and 146.5 mg/L, respectively. In the bilge waters, the lowest and highest COD values were 22 and 5890 mg/L, respectively, and the lowest and highest oil-grease values were 11.3 and 10000.0 mg/L, respectively. Generally, according to the Water Pollution Control Regulation, it was found that the water temperature was in the I-II. class, dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation I. class in lake water, and pH in IV. class due to the alkaline lake water. However, the mean COD and oil-grease values in the samples of lake water are IV. class. The oil-grease values in all ships were above the limit value (15 mg/L) according to MARPOL 73/78. As a result of the study, it was determined that the areas used as a ship haven were adversely affected by the bilge waters left by the ships.

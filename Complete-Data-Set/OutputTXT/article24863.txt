Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Turkish Airports Efficiency with FarePrimont and Malmquist Productivity Index
Özet: The growth of the air transportation sector with ever-increasing momentum requires the existing airports to operate more efficiently. Data envelopment analysis and stochastic boundary analysis, which are used to measure the efficiency of systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, have been used extensively in the literature in airports (Gillen and Lall,1997: Düzakın and Güçray, 2001: Carlsson, 2002: Kamp, 2005: Lin and Hong, 2006: Barros and Dieke, 2007: Maligheti etc, 2008). In this study, the efficiencies of 38 airports were evaluated with the FarePrimont and Malmquist indices considering the data for 2011-2014. FarePrimont analysis will be applied for the first time in Turkish airports with the results compared with the Malmquist productivity index. Malmquist productivity index which are applied panel data indices such as total factor productivity, technical change, technical efficiency change, pure efficiency change and scale efficiency change. According to the results of the study, the Malmquist total factor productivity index and the FarePrimont total factor productivity index are the biggest increases in total factor productivity between 2011-2014 in Isparta Süleyman Demirel Airport and the most decrease is in Tekirdag Corlu airport and Çanakkale airport.

Makale Başlığı: Applied Folklore – Historical Process
Özet: In recent years, one of the issues emphasized by the discourses related to the concept of globalization has been that the cultures that hold the power in the technological field have become the dominant culture through the tools they have, and confront other cultures that color the cultural mosaic around the world with the danger of extinction. It is seen that national and international organizations bearing this concern have taken some initiatives to protect the diversity of cultural expressions and to ensure cultural continuity and have tried to raise awareness on the subject.In the field of folklore, which has determined folk culture as its research field, a new approach has emerged in terms of transforming cultural elements into practice in daily life through preservation, revitalization, transfer, and re-creation. This approach, which has taken its place in as the concept of applied folklore, has carried folklore to the application dimension by directing it to a different front from the previous method of compilation, archiving, and analysis on the text. Thus, folklore will not only have a function that can support the preservation of cultures against globalization, but also create a new field of application in which it can put its knowledge into practice in solving some problems encountered in social life. This study focuses on the developments that paved the way for the emergence of the applied folklore approach, the conditions of its emergence, the debates shaped around it after it was named, the opposite concepts put forward as a result of these discussions, the attempts to define the term, the areas where folklore can be used. In short, in this study, the aim will be to explain the emergence, development, and current situation of applied folklore.

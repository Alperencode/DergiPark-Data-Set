Makale Başlığı: FROM THE COLONY OF JAPAN TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JAPANESE DEVELOPMENT MODEL: TRACES OF JAPAN IN THE DEVELOPMENTALIST POLITICAL ECONOMY OF SOUTH KOREA
Özet: While this study examines the effect of the colonial past on post-independence institutions on the Japan-South Korea axis through the experience of developmentalist political economy, it focuses on the application of the Japanese development model in the post-independence political economy of South Korea, a former Japanese colony, and detects the traces of Japan in the country's political economy. An exemplary study was conducted on how the colonial heritage felt itself in the social and economic structures established during and after the new state building, and how Korea was built on this colonial legacy with independence that came after years of control by Japan, and to what extent the colonial history was influential in the country's political economy. Within the scope of this study, while focusing on Japan's legacy in the Korean political economy, it is also aimed to include a comparative political economy perspective of the study with references to the world colonial history. The study mainly identifies the Japanese heritage in the history of South Korea's political economy, and identifies the traces of Japan in the success of South Korea, which emulates Japanese developmentalism in post-independence political economy. While the legacy of the infrastructure of the colonial period remains in one place, a theoretical discussion is carried out on the Japanese model, whose traces we see in a different dimension in the political economy of South Korea, with the adoption of the developmentalist model of Japan after independence.

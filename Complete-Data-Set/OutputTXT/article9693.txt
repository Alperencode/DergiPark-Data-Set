Makale Başlığı: Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Coxibs and their Compositions with Caffeine on the Level of Conjugated Dienes in the Formalin-Induced Edema Model
Özet: The development of novel pharmaceutical compositions, which are effective in the treatment of different inflammatory diseases and have a minimum number of side effects is very relevant. The aim of the present study was biochemical confirmation of anti-inflammatory activity of new pharmaceutical compositions comprising coxibs and caffeine. The level of conjugated dienes as primary products of lipid peroxidation has been evaluated in the plasma of rats at the acute inflammation caused by formalin. The white male rats of WAG line were used. The content of conjugated dienes was determined by spectrophotometric method. It was shown that combinations of caffeine and coxibs showed statistical significant decrease in the content of conjugated dienes in the rats’ blood plasma. Caffeine enriched anti-inflammatory action of coxibs effectively.

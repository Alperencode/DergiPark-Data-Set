Makale Başlığı: Effect of Borax Pentahydrate Substitution on Soundproofing and Mechanical Properties of Cement Mortar
Özet: Our country is very rich in terms of boron mine. It has been observed that there are few studies on the use of borax pentahydrate in concrete. In this study, the properties of cement mortars produced by substituting borax pentahydrate in cement at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% by weight were investigated. For this purpose, some mechanical and physical experiments were carried out to examine the sound transmission velocity, flexural and compressive strength properties of cement mortars. As a result of the tests and experiments, it was observed that the use of borax pentahydrate decreased the flexural and compressive strength values in cement mortars. It was determined that the highest flexural strength, compressive strength and ultrasonic sound velocity transmission among borax pentahydrate substituted cement mortars were obtained from 5% borax pentahydrate substituted mortars.

Makale Başlığı: THE FİGHT AGAİNST SYPHİLİS İN THE ATATURK PERIOD
Özet: From the beginning of the 16th century until the first half of the 20th century, syphilis is a contagious disease that affected the Ottoman Empire and the early Turkish Republic together with the whole world. Since it is a sexually transmitted disease in general, it was seen as a disease to be shamed and hidden among the public, causing psychological disorders and suicides with this dimension. The struggle against the disease, which can cause wounds that cannot be hidden in the body unless treated, and cause paralysis and painful death in the later stages, and which can affect the whole people with its ability to pass from generation to generation, has been started since the Ottoman period, and effective measures have been implemented in the Republican period. In this study, the effects of syphilis on public health, the treatment and prevention of syphilis during Ataturk's period will be explained.

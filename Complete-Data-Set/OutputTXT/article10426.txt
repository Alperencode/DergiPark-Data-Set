Makale Başlığı: City, Space, Border and Identity: The Role of Urban Borders in the Construction of Urban Identities in Turkey
Özet: This study aims to understand the role of urban borders in the construction of urban identities. For this purpose, it has been tried to understand the relationship between city, space, border and identity with examples from the identities of cities in Turkey. The main problematic of this study is how identities are constructed in urban space, what role urban borders play in the construction of urban identities, what kind of examples the urban borders present in the construction of urban identities in Turkey, and what dimensions the construction of urban identities through urban borders reveals. Within this problematic framework, it has been understood that there are four different dimensions of the relationship between urban identities and urban borders in the study. It has been observed that urban identities are shaped through urban borders, and each city distinguishes itself from others, makes it unique and exalts it. It has been seen that urban borders are a reflection of social processes in urban identities, especially migration and urbanization. It has been determined that urban borders have turned into narrower spaces in the face of the spread of urban identities. It has been understood that urban borders have become spaces where urban identities are intertwined and conflicted. In this context, the experiences of urban identities in Turkey have revealed that urban borders have a central role in the construction of urban identities.

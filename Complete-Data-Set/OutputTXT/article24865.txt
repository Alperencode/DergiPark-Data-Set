Makale Başlığı: BASIC SCIENCE AS A PREDICTOR OF STUDENTS’ PERFORMANCE IN SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCE SUBJECTS IN EKITI STATE, NIGERIA
Özet: This research work was a predictive study under correlation study. The study examines therelationship that existed between students’ performance in Basic Science at the Junior SecondarySchool Examination (2008) and their later performances in Senior School Science SubjectsExamination in (2011). The target population for the study was all the junior and SeniorSecondary Schools in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Random sampling techniques was used to selecttwenty-five (25) Junior and Senior Secondary Schools between 2008 and 2011, the instrumentused in the study was the Junior Secondary School Certificate Examination (JSCE) result (2008)Basic Science and Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) results in Biology, Chemistryand Physics (2012). Twelve hypotheses were raised, and a correlation analysis was done toestablish the relationship between students’ scores in Basic Science and the Senior SchoolScience subjects using spearman’s order rank correlation efficient (rho) at 0.05 an alpha level ofsignificance. The finding showed that the results of students in Basic Science and Senior SchoolSciences showed a positive significant correlation. And average mean indices showed that thestudents performed above average in both Basic Science in the Junior Secondary School and theSenior School Science subjects. It was also showed that Biology has least mean indices and thatstudents performed better in Physics than in Biology and Chemistry, it was also discovered thatthe average mean indices for female students was a little bit higher than that of male students andthat students performed better without considering the gender differences. Based on thesefindings, it was recommended that the placements of students in science class at the SeniorSecondary School should be based on the students’ performance in Basic Science at the JuniorSecondary School; and that students should be more serious about Biology and not to see it asthe simplest science subject that they can easily pass; it was also recommended that malestudents should not relent efforts in science subjects but put more efforts and that femalestudents should sustain their good performance in science subjects moreover it wasrecommended that some of the existing single – sex schools in the country be converted to coeducationalschools to raise the trends of students performances in science subjects.

The data were collected with demographic questionnaire, parent meal time behavior scale, child eating behavior scale, child dietary behavior scale and anthropometric measurements. The data were evaluated by descriptive statistics, chi-square test, student-t test and multiple regression analysis. Results: A total of 500 students and their parents (43.4% rural, 56.6% urban) participated in the study. The mean age of the children was 8.93 +0.85 in rural and 9.01+0.82 in urban. 53% of the students in rural were girls and 56.5% in urban. Childhood obesity rates was 18% in rural areas and 16% in urban area. In rural areas, it was found that parents reward use, positive persuasion, special meals and snack model meal time behaviors, while in urban areas parents insisted on eating, animal fat reduction and snack meal were statistically significant (p <0.001). It was observed that children in the rural areas exhibited a statistically significant difference in their food enthusiasm, drinking passion and food selectivity eating behaviors compared to children in urban area (p <0.001). Factors related to children’s dietary behavior were the amount of snack, food enthusiasm, food enjoyment, food selectivity, gender and the living area. Factors related to children's weight status were living area, reward use, animal fat reduction, food enthusiasm, pleasure of food, slow eating, and food selectivity.

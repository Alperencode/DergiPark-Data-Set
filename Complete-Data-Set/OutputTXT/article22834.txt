Makale Başlığı: THE IMPORTANCE OF USING THE SECOND SAFE SURGICAL CHECKLIST TO ROBOT-ASSISTED SURGERY (THE SECOND “TIME-OUT”)
Özet: Significant advances in technology have also affected surgical processes, allowing new techniques to be used in surgeries. In addition to traditional methods, robots began to be used in surgeries. Surgical interventions performed with the use of robots are called "Robotic Surgery," and it is an up-to-date technology that opens new horizons for humanity and is constantly developing. Robotic surgery has many advantages for patients, surgeons, and nurses due to its advantages such as less blood loss, lower transfusion rate, and shorter recovery time. Nurses are expected to adapt to and increase their professional nursing roles by following technological developments. Another important issue in robotic surgery is patient safety and the patient's position is a particular concern. Complications that may develop after robotic surgery may result from inappropriate patient positioning and incomplete patient safety. It has been determined that there is a decrease in morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period with the application of "time-out," which is included in the safe surgery checklist published by the World Health Organization in 2008. Complications that may develop in robotic surgery operations can be prevented by re-applying the “time-out” 3-4 hours after the start of the operation. In this article, it was aimed to adapt the second safe surgery checklist in robotic surgery to the conditions in our country.

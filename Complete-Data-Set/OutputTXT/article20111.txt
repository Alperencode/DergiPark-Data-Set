Makale Başlığı: Eschatological Myths in Christianity
Özet: Beliefs about death and after death have always attracted the attention of human beings because of giving meaning to life. How the universe, the world, and human beings were created, as well as how they will end, is an important subject of myths. The myths describing the extinction of the world and humanity are included in the scope of eschatology myths. The existence of a second world and after life is fundamental in the eschatological narratives of religions. Because to make the worldly life meaningful is possible with the imagination of a second life in which people can satisfy their wishes and desires. The eschatological teaching not only proclaims the imminent end of the world as divine judgment, but is also regarded as the beginning of salvation and eternal happiness. Since Christianity, which defines itself as a religion of salvation and is a religion of universal character, has beliefs about the earthly life and afterlife of people, eschatological myths are seen intensely. The fact that the basis of their theology was based on the belief in Jesus Christ and the second coming of Jesus Christ was effective in the Christians' interest in this issue. In addition, the statements of Jesus about eschatological beliefs and the apocalyptic scenarios told by the New Testament are other important elements of the intense presence of eschatological myths in Christianity. In this study, eschatology and escotological myths are examined in the perspective of History of Religions. Later, it was tried to reveal the religious and social bases of eschatological myths in Christianity in the center of the sacred texts.

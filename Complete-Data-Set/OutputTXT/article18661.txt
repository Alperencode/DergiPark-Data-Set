The problems encountered and their causes were revealed with the fishbone diagram, and then the criteria that emerged were ranked and evaluated according to their importance with the analytical network process method. As a result of the evaluations, it was concluded that the creation of a multidisciplinary working environment is of great importance in the digital transformation at airports.

Makale Başlığı: Elastofibroma dorsi: clinical evaluation of 61 casesand review of the literature
Özet: Objective: Elastofibroma dorsi (ED) is a rare, benign soft tissue tumor typically located between the inferior corner of the scapula and the posterior chest wall causing mass, scapular snapping and pain. With the classical symptoms and localization it is diagnosed without biopsy and treated with marginal resection. This study retrospectively analyzed the patients operated due to ED to evaluate the presenting symptoms, tumor size, complications, and clinical results and to suggest optimum treatments.Methods: This study included 51 patients operated due to ED in 2 different clinics between 2005 and 2015. The patients’ age, gender, side, symptoms, average duration of symptoms, tumor sizes, and professions were investigated. The radiological examinations of the patients were evaluated. The patients with lesions bigger than 5 cm were operated. The postoperative complications, recurrences, and functional results were evaluated using Constant score.Results: A total of 61 operated lesions of 51 patients clinically and radiologically diagnosed with ED were retrospectively evaluated. The average symptom time was 11.21 months. The lesion of 19 (37.2%) patients was bilateral. However, 10 of the symptomatic patients with lesions bigger than 5 cm were operated. The average lesion diameter was 8.7 cm. The average follow-up was 26.89 months. The Constant score was 67.28 before operation and raised to 92.88 (p<0.05). Seroma and hematoma were observed in 11.5% of the patients.Conclusion: Generally, good clinical results can be obtained with marginal resection without requiring a biopsy, considering the classical complaints and radiological appearance of ED. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.16.0027This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

Makale Başlığı: İNTİBAH-I MİLLÎ
Özet: Samsun grows into a big town after the constitutional monarchy comes into force. Theatres were opened; poetry volumes and novels were published in Samsun. İntibah-ı Milli, a play written by Remzi-i Ayntabî, was among these books. Although its publication date is unknown, it is thought that it appeared in 1911 or 1912. It was one of the first published plays. Even though its aesthetic quality can be questionable, it is an important work that represents the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and teaches some lessons to youth. The play considerably increased public awareness. The play conveys its message and tried to enlighten the youth to restore the country. Necdet Efendi, Fikret Efendi and İsmet Efendi,  three central characters in İntibah-ı Millî, represent different perspectives and attitudes in a way that represents the opinions of the period. The study concludes that İntibah-ı Millî is an important literary achievement concerning its narrative and thematic quality and portrays the characters in the face of collapse of the Ottoman Empire. This study also reviews the social and economic events of the period and how it was first transcribed into Latin.

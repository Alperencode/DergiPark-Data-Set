Makale Başlığı: Immune-Mediated Eye Diseases in Dogs
Özet: The immune system is one of the most complex and comprehensive parts of the body. It has been developed to effectively eliminate potential pathogens that may encounter throughout the animals’ life. Autoimmune diseases occur when this defence system of the body is directed to the host instead of pathogens that disrupt the physiological order. The eye has consisted with an organ-specific immunological structure in order to maintain and control local immunity, independent of the body. Pathological changes that will occur as a result of an abnormal immune response to any pathogen or resident cell groups in the eye may threaten the vision. Undesirable immunological reactions can occur in dogs, especially against structures in the anterior segment of the eye. Early diagnosis of immune-mediated diseases with clinical examination and laboratory tests is important for the treatment and prognosis of the disease. The purpose of this review is to provide information about the etiology, clinical appearance, histopathological findings andtreatment of the most common immune system-related eye diseases in dogs.

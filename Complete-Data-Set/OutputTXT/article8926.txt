Makale Başlığı: Re-Appraisal of Juynboll Theories about Ḥadith
Özet: Juynboll, who had developed the theories of Orientalists such as Ignaz Goldziher, Joseph Schacht, and James Robson with a new method, combined their techniques in his work and found the opportunity to benefit from Islamic sources more widely, using this style, has been considered as the main reference source in ḥadīth studies related to Orientalism and methods related to the field. Juynboll is a researcher who had gained great fame after Goldziher and Schacht in the field of Orientalism with his works. He had worked on many subjects such as narrators who had transmitted ḥadīth from the first century to the next centuries, and ḥadīth texts accepted by jurists, ḥadīth scholars, and methodologist scholars. Therefore, making a comprehensive study of Juynboll’s theories in the fields of ḥadīth and Orientalism is an absolute step to contribute to these fields. This study, which we have aimed to introduce, is a work that has aimed to examine Juynboll’s theories from a different perspective, to criticize his theories on Sunnah as evidence, and to contribute to the areas in question within the framework that we have mentioned. This work, which had referenced academic studies on Juynboll written in four languages (the English language, the Arabic language, the Turkish language, and the Urdu language), has differed from other studies by identifying, describing, and criticizing the deficiencies in these studies with its original and brave style. In addition, it has meticulously revealed many theories in this field that had been neglected or not studied for other reasons, with a scientific method. Our aim in this study containing presentation and evaluation is to contribute to a modicum of the inspiration of new and current studies by revealing the place, position, features, differences, and importance of this work in the literature.Keywords: Ḥadīth, Juynboll, Re-appraisal, Western Studies, Orientalism.

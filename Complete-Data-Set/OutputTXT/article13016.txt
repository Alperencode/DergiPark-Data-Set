Makale Başlığı: DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE TOURISM PERCEPTIONS AND VOLUNTEER SIMPLE LIFESTYLE OF TOURISTS TRAVELING FOR THE PURPOSE OF THERMAL: THE CASE OF PAMUKKALE
Özet: Sustainability and the environment are among the concepts that do not lose their importance in terms of tourism. Because talking about a sustainable tourism is only possible with the protection of the environment. Environmental sustainability can only be achieved by raising individual awareness and living in accordance with the protection of nature by abandoning unnecessary consumption habits. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to determine the voluntary simple lifestyles of domestic tourists traveling for thermal tourism and sustainable tourism perceptions and to examine the relationship between them. In accordance with the purpose of the research, data were collected from people who visited Pamukkale in February in 2022 and stayed in thermal hotels by using convenience-sampling method. Frequency analysis, reliability analysis, independent group t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation analysis were applied on 296 questionnaires in total. The research has concluded that factors such as individuals' marital status, age, educational status, occupation and income, number of visits to the destination are effective on individuals' sustainable tourism perceptions and voluntary simple lifestyles. In addition, it has been concluded that there is a positive relationship between individuals' voluntary simple lifestyle preferences and sustainable tourism perceptions, and that this relationship is affected by economic and environmental factors. In this context, it is recommended to implement a number of projects and incentive programs explaining the importance of sustainable tourism and voluntary simple lifestyle to all tourism stakeholders, especially policy makers and business owners.

Makale Başlığı: Influence of weekly endoscopic debridement on success rate of endoscopic transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy
Özet: Aim: To evaluate the outcomes of transcanalicular diode laser DCR (TL-DCR) in patients with chronic dacryostenosis.Methods: In this retrospective study we included 75 eyes of 67 patients with chronic dacryostenosis who underwent TL-DCR. In 65 patients transnasal endoscopic debridement the opening and nasalacrimal syringing was performed every week for 1 month (Group 1, 65 patients). The later patients who did not have postoperative visits were defined as Group 2 (10 patients). All patients were examined at postoperative 3 months.Results: In group 1, 65 of 63 patients had complete surgical success and two had restenosis. In group 2, six of 10 patients had success however four had restenosis. In group 1 the surgical success rate was 98% whereas it was 60% in group 2 (p< 0.001). None of the patients had any serious complications including infection and bleeding.Conclusions: The surgical success rate of TL-DCR may increase by endoscopic debridement after the surgery.

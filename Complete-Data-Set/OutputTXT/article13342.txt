Makale Başlığı: Deconstruction of Oedipus the King in Myth Due to the Naming of the Oedipus Complex
Özet: With the acceleration of interdisciplinary studies, naming discoveries inspired by different fields has become widespread at the same speed. In this study, it is emphasized that the diseases or syndromes defined in psychology are named after the myths in the circle of literature and history, but this naming causes those who do not know the myths to misunderstand and misinterpret the character in the myth. In addition, it has been emphasized that the inspired myth may actually have been misinterpreted based on the life story of the name maker. Sophocles' Oedipus the King is one of the myths in which his character is misdiagnosed. Freud chose Oedipus as the name of the syndrome he discovered because it reflects his own life story, but there is a big difference between what Freud felt consciously and the fate that Oedipus lived without even being aware of it. To be able to eliminate this misfortune that has happened to other myths like this, requires mastering the whole story before choosing the myths that are the source of inspiration in naming diseases.

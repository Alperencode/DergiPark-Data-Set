Özet: Gamification is a new design for many fields in changes in the expectations and satisfaction levels of each individual with digital literacy skills, as well as in their behavior and habits. Utilizing the benefits of its frame is also a critical issue for the maritime education. In this context, it is aimed to measure the predisposition and interest of the maritime university students in the game contents by conducting a survey. Statistical results are obtained regarding the attitudes of the participants towards learning with computer games, their attitudes and expectations towards gamification and how useful gamification could be for non-game systems. Lastly, it is revealed which courses in maritime can be gamified.  Accordingly, it is seen that the majority of the students are intertwined with games every day. The reason why the majority of the people prefer to play 'multiplayer' games is the desire to be successful brought by the competitive environment or the communication-based system being more interesting and increasing motivation even more. Attendances consider that gamification will make the lessons more interesting, specifically electronic navigation and maritime security courses.

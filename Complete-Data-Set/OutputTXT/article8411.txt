Makale Başlığı: 1599 Chios Raid and Situation of Chios Jews
Özet: This article deals with a decision taken to expel the Jews of Chios from the city wall where they lived for centuries. In 1599, a group of Florentine adventurers attacked the island of Chios, and with the effect of this development, new security measures were taken by the Ottomans on the island. In the article, the conditions under which the security measures are taken are shaped and the course of the attack is discussed. The question of whether the Jews of Chios pose a security threat is answered from this perspective. In this context, it is stated that the mechanism designed to defend the city of Chios was not operated for a long time, and when the city was attacked, it is not possible to definitively understand whether the non-Muslims living in Chios cooperated with the enemy. In addition, it is claimed that the historical basis of the decision about the expulsion of the Chios Jews from the city should be sought in non-security factors, and it is discussed whether the Jews of Chios were expelled from the city walls.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Bacterial Flora of the Digestive System of Sitona puncticollis Stephens, 1831 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)
Özet: In this study, the bacterial flora in the digestive system of Sitona puncticollis Stephens, 1831 (Curculionidae: Entiminae) from the Curculionidae (Coleoptera) family, which has ecological and economic importance, was investigated. It is stated that this organism is a host in the alfalfa plant and causes significant damage with the increase in population. The samples were collected from the alfalfa fields around the town of Özbağ (Kırşehir) using the scraper sweeping technique. The samples were brought to the laboratory alive in sterile tubes and dissected, the digestive tracts were removed and bacterial isolation was made. Morphological, biochemical and physiological tests were applied to identify a single isolate as a result of bacteriological examination. As a result of the tests, it was determined that the isolate is gram positive, immobile, colonies on nutrient agar and blood agar are non-pigmented, its optimum growth temperature range is 15-370C and its salt tolerance is 10% NaCl. It has been emphasized that the data obtained will form an important infrastructure for biological control against pests.

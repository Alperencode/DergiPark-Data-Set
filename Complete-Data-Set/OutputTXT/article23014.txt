Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Golden Ratio Theory in Terms of Economic Theories
Özet: There is a direct relationship between the economic resources and the natural balance. Indeed, the laws of nature play a fundamental determining role as a process that directs the behavior and movements of living and non-living beings in nature. According to Adam Smith, the functioning of the economy and the formation of the general state of equilibrium occur entirely thanks to the rational human behavior called the "invisible hand". It means nature has equipped people with an instinct that directs them to serve the social interest while considering their own concerns. This approach of Smith is also accepted by Keynes. According to Keynes, while individuals make consumption and other economic decisions with the “spiritus animalis”, they try to make the best decision by acting according to their instincts, just like migratory birds. These approaches of Smith and Keynes show that the golden ratio in mathematics and the Fibonacci approaches based on it can also be evaluated in terms of the relations between economic indicators. In this study, an analysis has been tried to be made within the framework of the thesis that there is a mutual and harmonious relationship between macroeconomic indicators and the golden ratio of a country.In this context, the golden ratio theory has been evaluated from a macroeconomic perspective. Thus, it has been shown how the discipline of economics is in a logical relationship with other disciplines

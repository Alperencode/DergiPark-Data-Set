Makale Başlığı: Abu Al Qasim Al Zahrawi (Albucasis): The father of modern surgery
Özet: Known as the father of surgery, Al-Zahrawi (936-1013) made significant contributions to modern medicine and surgery. His greatest contribution to science was his work “Kitab al-Tasrif”, which he shared nearly fifty years of experience and medical education by writing and illustrating. In this study, he explained not only surgical interventions, but also methods and surgical instruments developed by him for the diagnosis and treatment of medicine. In the last chapter of Al-Tasrif consisting of 30 volumes, "On Surgery and Tools", he introduced many surgical instruments such as scalpels, forceps, retractors, curettes, pincers, specula, cauterization, and binding style instruments. This study aims to provide an overview of Al-Zahrawi's life whose contributions to science living in medieval Islamic geography are not limited to modern medicine and surgery.

Makale Başlığı: SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEMS FACED BY QUALIFIED IMMIGRANTS FROM GERMANY TO TURKIYE
Özet: The main reasons for the Turkish-German migration, which has been going on for more than 60 years, are of an economic nature. With this labour migration, Turkiye hopes to address rising unemployment and foreign debt, meet foreign exchange needs, and contribute to the country's economy by returning competent Turkish workers who have earned professional experience in Germany. The return of the workers to the country as qualified immigrants took place in the early 2000s and lasted longer than intended. Although the issue of why these qualified immigrants come to Turkey from Germany has been investigated by many studies, the socioeconomic problems they face when they come to Turkiye have not yet been the subject of sufficient research. But, shed light on the process experienced by these qualified immigrants, who can play critical roles in terms of socioeconomic development of Turkiye, is as important as investigating the reasons behind their return migration from Germany for Turkiye. The findings obtained in this study, which was carried out using the semi-structured interview technique by choosing the qualitative research method and data collection techniques, were discussed adopting the descriptive analysis method. Thus, the goal of this research is to find out what sort of socioeconomic challenges these second and third generation Turkish or Turkish origin German migrants encounter in Turkiye, and how effective these problems are in influencing their decision to return to Germany.

Makale Başlığı: Determination Effects of Rheum ribes L. against High Calorie Diet-induced Obesity: Investigation of Changes in Immunologic and Neurologic Enzymes Activities
Özet: This study was carried out to investigate the immunotoxic and neurotoxic effects of Rheum ribes L. (Rr) plant extract on liver, brain and heart tissues in rats with an experimental obesity model. Wistar albino male rats were used in the study. In this study, 4 groups were formed, one of which was the control group, and each group consisted of 6 rats. The groups were the ''control (CG)'', ''high calorie diet (HCD) control (HCDG)'', 'HCD + Rr (200 mg/kg) (HCDRHE1)'' and ''HCD + Rr (400 mg/kg) (HCDRHE2)''. At the end of the study, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), adenosineaminase (ADA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) biomarkers were evaluated in tissues. According to the study findings, the ADA and MPO activity levels of the obese group increased significantly compared to the control group, and these enzyme levels in the groups administered Rr plant extract approached the control group levels. On the other hand, the AChE and BChE activity levels of the obese group decreased compared to the control group, and there was a statistically significant increase in the groups administered plant extracts compared to the control group. In conclusion, Rr plant root extract suppresses neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity in rats with obesity induced by a high-calorie diet (HCD).

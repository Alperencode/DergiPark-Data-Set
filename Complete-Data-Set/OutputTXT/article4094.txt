Makale Başlığı: Postmodernıst Elements in Sadık Yemni's Novel Of Nazarzede Clınıc
Özet: Postmodernism, which has not been fully agreed on in its definition and boundaries, has become an art movement that is increasingly utilized in Turkish novels after 1980 due to some editing techniques, perspective, language and expression possibilities it offers to writers. Elements such as metafiction, intertextuality, deconstruction, irony, play, fantasy, simulation, pluralism, which are frequently seen in the works after 1980, required to approach the works with the techniques and perspectives imposed by postmodernism. However, it would be wrong to call every work that has these features a 'postmodern work'. The specified features should be decided within the general context of the work. "Postmodernism", which gains meaning with the "post" suffix that precedes modernism, has been considered both as a "continuation of modernism" and as a "reaction to modernism".Nazarzede Clinic novel, written by Sadık Yemni to criticize the world that has lost its meaning in which modern people live, is a remarkable work with its postmodern techniques and language. In the narrative, in which imagination and reality are intertwined, how reality is distorted/distorted in our age is reflected, and the collision of "postmodern reality" and "truth" with the techniques of postmodernism is conveyed to the reader. In this study, where data was collected through document analysis, the reflections of postmodern elements on the language in the novel Nazarzede Kliniği were also tried to be determined. In our study, Sadık Yemni's ways of using the techniques of postmodernism (fantasy, simulation, intertextuality, irony, pluralism, pop-art, deconstruction in language) and "tradition", which is the representative of "truth", were examined by giving examples from the work.

Makale Başlığı: Carob As A Functional Food Ingredient: Properties and Food Applications
Özet: The interest on carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) and its products has increased in recent years due to their rich nutrient and bioactive content along with enabling the production of gluten-free products. Carob is also used as a raw material in the production of various commercial products. General information about the properties and applications of carob for the production of different food products was provided in this review. According to the literature, carob contains high levels of sugar, mineral substances and vitamins (A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, C, D, E).  Besides that the carob pods are used in the form of carob flour, carob gum (LBG) is reported to be obtained from the seed. Different parts of carob have been a subject of various food applications due to the differences in their contents. For instance, while carob flour can be used as a cocoa substitute in cakes and biscuits, there are also studies related to the use of carob fibres and seed flour in order to improve the quality of gluten-free breads, rheological properties of the products made from vegetable milk, and textural properties in meat products. In the light of all these, it is concluded that carob products have a great potential to be used as a functional food ingredient. Prospective studies on carob-added food products has an importance to meet the possible future requirements on cocoa substitutes, hydrocolloids obtained from natural sources, and gluten-free products appealing the celiac patients’ taste.

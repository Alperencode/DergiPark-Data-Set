Makale Başlığı: Does Vankomisin Decreases İnfection in Spinal Suregery?
Özet: İntroduction:Spinal surgery is one of the surgical procedures with high morbidity and mortality. Despite the advances in surgical techniques, wound infection is still an important problem in spinal surgery, The use of local Vancomycin to prevent wound infection has been investigated in many studies, and no clear result has been reached. In this study, we evaluated the results of patients who received vancomycin prophylactically instead of wound and those who were not used to prevent wound infection. Material and methods: A total of 36 patients who underwent spinal surgery were evaluated retrospectively. The demographic data of these patients were accessed from the hospital registry system and recorded. The patients were divided into two groups as Vancomycin applied and not applied locally. The patients in both groups were compared in terms of comorbid factors, age, gender, body mass index, blood parameters, postoperative complications and wound infections.                   Results: There was no difference between the distribution of demographic data and complications of both groups. (p> 0.05) When wound infections of both groups were compared, no difference was found between them. (p> 0.05) Conclusion: We think that local vancomycin administration does not reduce the possibility of wound infection. Moreover, we believe that it will cause the development of resistant microorganisms.

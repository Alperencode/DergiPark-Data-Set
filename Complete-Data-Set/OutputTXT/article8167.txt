Makale Başlığı: HEGEL'IN PRATIK FELSEFESINDE HAK İLIŞKISININ YAPISAL KOŞULLARI
Özet: The article explores aspects of the dialectical deductive process of the concept of free will, the principal organizing and operating concept of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. In this respect, it reflects on the structural components of the concept of free will, which is the starting point of the science of right, since the relation of right is for Hegel the realization of free will. In parallel, the article attempts to highlight some crucial points with respect to the speculative dialectical method that underlies the Hegelian argument at this juncture. In that respect, the article aspires to a brief reconstruction of the formal and substantive presuppositions of Hegel's mature practical philosophy.

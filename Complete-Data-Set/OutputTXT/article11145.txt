Makale Başlığı: Molecular and Morphological Identification of Melanoleuca cinereifolia from Türkiye
Özet: Melanoleuca cinereifolia is identified based on macro/micro-morphological characters and DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (nrITS) region and is reported here for the first time from Diyarbakır province of Türkiye. Macro- and micro-morphological description of the species is provided along with the photographs of fresh basidiomes in natural habitat and the line drawings. The species is mainly characterized by basidiome with a short stipe, grayish-brown pileus, grey lamellae and lageniform cystidia. In the phylogram, M. cinereifolia is clustered with its allies in the subgenus Melanoleuca. Morphological and molecular similarities and differences among the species and the close relatives were discussed in detail.

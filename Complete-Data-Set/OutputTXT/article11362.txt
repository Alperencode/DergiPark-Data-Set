Makale Başlığı: Consciousness of Space: Inclusive Design Context and Covid-19
Özet: Throughout the ongoing history, the concept of space has been discussed and studied by many different masses and thinkers from many different angles, considering its user. It has been tried to be developed by producing ideas on it. The conditions, lives and spaces of the 'Covid-19', which has recently taken the whole world under its influence, waiting to be solved and turned into a global problem, are negatively affecting lives and spaces. The parallel progression of the obligatory time spent indoors due to the increase in the disease has made users and designers think again about the necessity of examining the space in a new dimension, different from its own scope. This situation has given birth to new demands, needs and requirements in the context and scope of the concept of space and has provided the opportunity for designers to look at the space from a different perspective in terms of the reconfiguration and use of the space. For this reason, while the article originally addressed the concept of space in the context of consciousness from a different perspective, it also included the concept of inclusive space, evaluated and developed the subject through a sample. The method of the article begins with a literature review, which is one of the research methods that researchers often use and lays the groundwork for scientific research and studies. Based on the literature reviews, it has been determined that the concept of space has been examined from many different angles, and it has been observed that the space is divided into different groups in the context of the user, and it is called private and public spaces. The article, by focusing on the concept of inclusive space in the context of general space, supported the research process with a hotel lobby design, which is an original design example with analysis, interpretation and 'Covid-19' precaution.

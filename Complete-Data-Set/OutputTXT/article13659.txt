Makale Başlığı: SAINT CATHERINE OF ALEXANDRIA IN BAROQUE PAINTING
Özet: Saint Catherine of Alexandria, considered one of the early Christian martyrs, is the most illustrated“holy virgin” figure in Christianity after the Virgin Mary. The Golden Legend book, compiled in the thirteenthcentury, plays an important role in the spreading of legends about the saint. Catherine, whose legend hasexpanded since the Middle Ages and has been cultized with changing stories; has been the subject of artfor centuries with the stories about her nobility, philosophical knowledge, eloquence, courage, intelligence,striking beauty and determined belief. The popularity of Catherine, started towards the end of the Middle Ages,continues also throughout the Baroque period after the Renaissance and Mannerist periods with the supportof the Catholic Church. There are numerous portraits of Catherine; her mystical marriage to Jesus, her conflictwith philosophers, her refusal to worship pagan idols, and her martyrdom, as well as her numerous illustrationswith other sacred considered figures. In this study, it is aimed to investigate and iconographically examine theoil paintings of St. Catherine of Alexandria on canvas, found at the museums and galleries, which were madein the Baroque period. These paintings, based on stories that have been expanded and / or changed, adornedboth church altars and walls of aristocrats for many years, despite the dubious historical personality of thecultized saint.

Makale Başlığı: What Do Nurses Experience in Pandemics? A Scale Development Study
Özet: Aim: To develop a valid and reliable measurement tool to identify the challenges nurses face during pandemics.Method: The study has a cross-sectional and methodological design. Using a multi-method approach, it was conducted with 405 nurses in Istanbul between May 15 and August 15, 2020. Data were collected online via the Personal Information Form and Draft Scale. Descriptive statistics, validity reliability analysis, and total score averages were evaluated for data analysis using SPSS 21 and AMOS 22 programs.Results: 38 items were grouped into four dimensions. The variance rate was found as 66.88%. Goodness-of-fit statistics were appropriate. The total correlation scores of the items were between 0.42-0.82 (p<0.001). Cronbach's alpha value was 0.92. There was no significant difference between the test-retest mean scores (t:1.349, p:0.188), while a highly significant correlation was found between the measurements (r:0.88 p<0.001). The overall mean score of the scale was 3.50±0.62.Conclusions: The valid and reliable scale can assist nurses, managers of healthcare institutions, and policymakers in developing coping strategies for the challenges.

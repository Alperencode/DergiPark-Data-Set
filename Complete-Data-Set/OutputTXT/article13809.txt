Makale Başlığı: Semiotic Analysis of Collective Memory Construction in Digital Games
Özet: Collective memory is reconstructed through ceremonies, rituals and festivals. These practices can be assumed to be repeated via remembering which bond the societies within the indicators of the past and the present. From the fashion of clothing to places and spheres; from the cultural concept of food and beverages to anatomopolitic practices, all play a different role in reconstructing the concept of collective memory. Remembering is one of the practices that brings the past to the present and this is the way to keep the past alive. The past is remembered through literature, news, films, television serials and games, and it is also reminded through media contents. The rituals of remembrance can be performed in digital spheres as well as physical places. Digital games are assumed to be one of these digital spheres. Starting from this point of view, a digital game called – “The 1979 Revolution Black Friday”, in which the Iranian Islamic Revolution is revived, is examined in this study to reveal how the collective memory of Iran and Iranian Revolution is being constructed. Based on Roland Barthes’ denotation and connotation conceptualizations, the game has been analyzed semiotically in 4 categories: These categories are; daily life, religion, politics and media. In this digital game, it is seen that the Revolution process is being reconstructed through collective memory with prominent indicators of Iran’s daily life practices, religious roots and the political structure of that society.

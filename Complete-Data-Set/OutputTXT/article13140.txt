Makale Başlığı: Biographical Study with Hermeneutic Approach in Psychiatric Care Delivered at Community Mental Health Centers
Özet: When the literature studies on the services provided in community mental health centers (CMHCs) are carefully evaluated, it is seen that there are research results with positive feedback. On the other hand, a structured daily work standard has not yet been reached regarding the psychiatric care services provided in the increasing number of centers. In order to establish such a standardized work, there is a need for nurses to carry different approaches to the services they provide to sick individuals to their practice areas. Biography study, which can be defined in general terms as the use of the possibilities available to the individual in the process of coping with the events affecting his/her life, is compatible with the need for the formation of community mental health centers and the understanding of multidisciplinary work as such an application area. In this article, the introduction of biography work, its transfer to psychiatric care practice services in CMHC and the interpretation of the individual's life story narrative with a hermeneutic approach are discussed.

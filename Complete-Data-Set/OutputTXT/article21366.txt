Makale Başlığı: Synthesis of some NH- and NH,S- substituted 1,4-quinones
Özet: A series of NH-substituted-1,4-quinones, possessing one, two, three or not chlorine, were synthesized by the reaction between different quinones (p-chloranil (1), p-toluquinone (2), or 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (3)) and (-)-cis-myrtanylamine (5) via nucleophilic reactions. Moreover, 2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone (4) was reacted with 2-(methylthio)ethylamine (11) to produce aminosubstituted naphthoquinones (12 and 13), bearing with bromine and not bromine. In addition, 2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone (4) was reacted with 4′-aminodibenzo-18-crown-6 (14) and 4′-aminobenzo-18-crown-6 (16) to yield crown-containing 1,4-naphthoquinones (15 and 17), respectively. New compounds were characterized, providing 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR, MS-ESI, UV/Vis and elemental analysis.

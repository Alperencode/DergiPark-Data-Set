Makale Başlığı: The Plate “Al-Kasibu Habibullah” in Terms of “Expression and Exposition” in The Philosophy of Art
Özet: In this study, the physical form of any work of art and the expression and exposition hidden in the physical form of that work of art and desired to be discovered by the art lover are discussed in terms of art philosophy. This situation has been evaluated in the context of the “Al-Kasibu Habibullah” calligraphy plate. First of all, the origin of the "el-Kasibu Habibullah" plate, whether it is a hadith or not, is discussed, and then it is also discussed in terms of art philosophy. In this sense, issues such as the similarity of the calligraphy plate to the ta'lik script, the perfection in the stacking of the script, and the choice of color were emphasized. In the second stage, the message of this plate to the art lover, the effect of the art lover on the problems he/she encounters in daily life, as well as the expression and exposition formed in the art work are discussed.

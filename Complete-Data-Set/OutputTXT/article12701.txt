Makale Başlığı: Developing a forest fire prediction model based on deep learning and forecast a fire risk map of Turkey
Özet: Forest fires are one of the main problems that cause economic losses by threatening natural life and biological ecosystem by disrupting forestry activities. Fires can cause damage to the natural sources like vegetation, water and air, or completely eradicate them. They can also cause loss of life and property by damaging the residential areas and cultivated areas around the forests. Therefore, it is important to make the right decisions and make effective planning on using these resources in order to reduce the risk of forest fires and minimize destruction. In this study, Forest Fire Analysis Forecasting (OYAT) model has created to be used in the fight against forest fires. OYAT has built based on previous fires, vegetation, climate changes and human factors datasets obtained from official sources. OYAT has created by processing these datasets with deep learning techniques. By using OYAT, forest fires can be predicted and a regional fire risk map can be forecasted with analyzed datasets. By its compatibility with geographic information systems (GIS), OYAT has a structure that is easy to use, can be updated with dynamic data, and can be visualized and stored. Forest fire data in Turkey between 2013 and 2019 has used for evaluation OYAT. The maps created with OYAT, have got 98% successful ratio. With the growth of the datasets in the following years, it has predicted that OYAT model will be more efficient and successful in planning for fire prevention.

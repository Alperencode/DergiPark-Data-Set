Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Drama in Early Childhood Education Course on Professional Development of Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes towards Drama and Teachers' Self-Efficacy Beliefs
Özet: This study aims to reveal the effect of Drama in Early Childhood Education course in the undergraduate program on the attitudes of teacher candidates towards drama and teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs as a professional development opportunity. A single-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research model was used to examine the effects of teacher candidates' attitudes towards drama and their teaching self-efficacy beliefs. The sample of this study consists of 52 sophomore students attending a pre-school teaching undergraduate program at a state university. "Attitude Scale Towards Creative Drama Lesson" was developed by Adıgüzel (2007) to determine pre-service teachers' attitudes towards drama, and the "Early Childhood Teachers’ Self-Efficacy Beliefs Scale" was developed by Tepe & Demir (2012) to determine teacher self-efficacy. The effect of this course was examined by making measurements before and after the Drama in Early Childhood Education course, which pre-school teacher candidates attended for 14 weeks. Since the data obtained from the Attitudes towards Creative Drama Lesson Scale did not show normal distribution, the Wilcoxon Rank test was used in the analysis, and the dependent groups' t-test was used because the data obtained from the early childhood teachers’ Self-Efficacy Beliefs Scale showed normal distribution. The findings revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in the attitudes towards the drama lesson and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs of the second year early childhood teacher candidates who took the "Drama Education in Early Childhood" course in the undergraduate program at the end of their 14-week education. For this reason, it has been concluded that drama education at the undergraduate level is an important opportunity for teacher candidates to develop their professional self-efficacy.

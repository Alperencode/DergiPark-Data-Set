Makale Başlığı: Impact of the BIM system in construction management services in developing countries; Case of Turkey
Özet: Today's construction industry changes and develops with the developing technology. One of the most important technological changes is the Building Information Modeling (BIM) system. Adoption of the BIM system is essential in CM services, which include consulting services in addition to engineering services. In this study, it is aimed to examine the benefits and challenges of using the BIM system in CM services and the necessity of using this system by determining the duties of the Construction Manager. In this context, a survey was conducted and analyzed for professional CM companies regarding the implementation of BIM system in CM services in construction projects in Turkey, a developing country. According to the results of the analysis, although the lack of trained staff emerged as the most important challenge, the increase in interdisciplinary coordination and the reduction of design errors with conflict analysis were determined as the most important benefits. In addition, the tasks of the Construction Manager in the use of the BIM system are listed in order of importance. This study is one of the pioneering studies on the implementation of the BIM system in CM services. In the light of the result obtained, legal regulations, standards, contracts, and execution plans can be composed for the use of the BIM system in CM services. Therefore, it is hoped that this study will contribute to the building production stakeholders in the integration of the BIM system with CM services.

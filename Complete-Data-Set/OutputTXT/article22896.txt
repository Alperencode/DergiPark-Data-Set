Makale Başlığı: Association of Celiac Disease and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Polymorphism
Özet: Objective: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease. Although susceptibility to thrombosis in celiac patients has been reported in case studies, the cause is not yet known. PAI-1 inhibits fibrinolysis. In this study, the association between celiac disease and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism was investigated among celiac patients whose disease were confirmed by intestinal biopsy and healthy controls.Methods: Biopsy-diagnosed celiac patients (n=56) and healthy controls (n=52) were included in the study. PCR-RFLP method was used for PAI-1 genotyping and the results were compared according to statistical significance.Results: The PAI-1 4G allele associated with thrombotic risk and inflammation was found to be higher than the 5G allele in cases (0.63 and 0.36, respectively, p=0.054). When the age at diagnosis was compared according to the PAI-1 variants, no significant difference was found (p=0.3). Although the genotype frequencies were similar in 4G/4G patients and controls, the 5G/5G genotype, known as the protective genotype, was found to be higher in controls (35% and 18%).Conclusion: In our study, the 4G allele of PAI-1, which plays a role in the susceptibility to thrombosis, was observed more frequently in celiac patients compared to the control group. Studying genetic markers of thrombosis in celiac patients is important for individual prophylaxis.

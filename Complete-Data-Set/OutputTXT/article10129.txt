Makale Başlığı: Antioxidative Responses of Sage to PEG-induced Drought Stress
Özet: The current study was conducted to find out the effect of two polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced drought treatments (-0.4 and -0.8 MPa) on sage (Salvia officinalis L.). Twenty five-day old cuttings were exposed to drought treatments for seven days. Membrane damage and water loss were gradually increased with the severity of drought. While reductions in membrane integrity and water content showed that sage was affected by drought, even increased flavonoid and antioxidant enzyme activities could not alleviate this effect. H2O2 content of leaves increased with decreasing water potential conditions, indication an oxidative stress caused by drought. Elevated levels of SOD and POD activities indicated that the enzymes were involved in scavenging of H2O2. Sage was successfully increased the tolerance to withstand to drought.

Makale Başlığı: Biomechanical Comparison of Different Subtrochanteric Bone Fracture Angles in Cerclage Wiring: Finite Element Study
Özet: Cerclage wires are regularly hired as fixation gear to resource reposition, enhance alignment and growth fixation stability. In specific femoral shaft, subtrochanteric and periprosthetic fractures gain from cerclage fixation. Also in supracondylar femoral shaft fractures, extra cord cerclages proved to be extra than only a reposition device and accelerated the general power of the osteosynthesis construct. This study tests for the stabilizing effect of different bone fracture angles in with cerclage. Cerclage fixation of a oblique fractures were tested with fracture angles (45°, 55°, 65°). Construct stiffness and displacements were investigated under static loads and compared to the different bone fracture angles. With each of the tested bone fractures, stiffness wasn't significantly for a compare angles. Most reduction in fracture gap movement was achieved by 65° fracture angle, followed by 55° and 45° fractures. All cerclage wire fixation were generally superior with reduced fracture movements whereas in 65 degree fracture showing the greatest stabilizing effect. Cerclage wire application has emerged as a potential therapeutic for subtrochanteric fractures.

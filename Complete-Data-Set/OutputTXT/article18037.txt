Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF CLINICAL FEATURES AND RISK FACTORS AFFECTING BLEEDING IN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL ANGIODYSPLASIA
Özet: AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical features and risk factors affecting bleeding in patients with angiodysplasia.MATERIA L AND METHOD: This retrospective study was conducted between January 2016 and December 2019, and included patients who underwent endoscopy/colonoscopy examination for any reason at two institutions (n=2177). Patients with angiodysplasia were divided into two groups according to their bleeding status, and their clinical features and risk factors affecting bleeding were analyzed.RESULTS: Angiodysplasia was detected in 44 (2.02%) patients who underwent endoscopy and colonoscopy. Bleeding was detected in 25% (n=11) of patients with angiodysplasia. Warfarin use frequency (p=0.016) and heart disease frequency (p=0.008) were higher in patients with angiodysplasia with bleeding. Hemoglobin (p=0.001), hematocrit (p < 0.001), platelet levels (p=0.009) and total iron binding capacity (p=0.036) were found to be significantly lower in patients with bleeding angiodysplasia. It was found that patients using warfarin had a 12.917-fold higher risk of bleeding than nonusers (OR:12.917, 95%CI: 2.014-82.830, p=0.007). Bleeding was not associated with age (p=0.196), gender (p=0.326), number of lesions (p=0.063), gastric lesion (p=0.880), duodenal lesion (p=0.472), colonic lesion (p=0.947), size of lesion (p=0.789), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use (p=0.631), hypertension (p=0.163), cirrhosis (p=0.179), coronary artery disease (p=0.448) and heart diseases (p=0.207).CONCLUSION: The use of warfarin increases the risk of bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. Risk factors affecting bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal angiodysplasia need to be evaluated in comprehensive prospective studies.

Özet: The factors that have gaining importance increasingly, such as quality, performance, competition, and cost-pressure have resulted in that the public organizations need strategic management approach. The term “strategic planning” has found a legal perspective with “the Law of Public Financial Management and Control” (the Law 5018) in 2003; it has become compulsory for public authorities to implement it after 2006. Universities have started to prepare and implement strategic plans as well with respect to the Regulation for Academic Evaluation and Quality Improvement in Higher Education Institutions promulgated in 2005. Strategic plans have provided important interests for the Universities in Turkey to gain competitive advantages in international level, and to determine their present situations, and visions, and thus to develop strategic aims, targets, and activities toward their visions. In this study, the strategic plans of four ADIM universities in the Western Mediterranean have been evaluated according to the legislation. Although there are some deficiencies and supremacies in the strategic plans evaluated, it is considered that the universities have developed their experiences well in this field.

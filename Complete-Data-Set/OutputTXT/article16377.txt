Makale Başlığı: A New Species of Glasswort from Türkiye, Salicornia hamzaoglui (Amaranthaceae)
Özet: Some interesting Salicornia specimens were collected from the salt marshes on gypsum soils in the Zara and Hafik counties of Sivas, Türkiye. These specimens are morphologically like the Salicornia perspolitana species distributed in Iran but differ from it by having leaves with distinct membranous margins, the central flowers only reach the upper segment in the lower parts of the spikes and having shorter spikes. These specimens, named Salicornia hamzaoglui, were introduced to the scientific world as a new species, and detailed descriptions, phenology, habitat characteristics and chromosome numbers were given.

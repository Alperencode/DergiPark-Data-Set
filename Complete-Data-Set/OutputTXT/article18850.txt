Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Customer Satisfaction and Preference Levels in Participation and Deposit Banks: A Study in Central Anatolia Region
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to determine the reasons why the participation banks and deposit banks operating in the Central Anatolia Region are preferred by the bank customers and to measure the satisfaction level of the bank customers on the participation and deposit banks. For this purpose, frequency analyzes, and parametric statistical tests were used to evaluate the data set used in the study. According to the findings obtained from the empirical results of the study, the reason why participation banks are preferred by bank customers is that they do not have interest rate sensitivity as claimed in the literature, and that these banks have equal rights with deposit banks. In addition, it was concluded in the study that internet banking and mobile banking transactions are the two most important factors in the preference of participation and deposit banks, and individuals prefer deposit banks more than participation banks.

Makale Başlığı: A Model Proposal in an Interdisciplinary Approach:  Teaching Mathematics with Music
Özet: Turkey has been participating in international TIMMS exams since 1999 and PISA exams since 2003, but it seems that despite the passing time, it has not been able to move from the back to the front row in the ranking. National and international researches have shown that Interdisciplinary use of music in mathematics teaching, which has positive effects in many areas, can contribute to the methods and strategies used. A model proposal was developed for the use of music in mathematics teaching based on the TÜBİTAK project, whose aim is to develop material based on music in mathematics instruction and to investigate the effects of 3rd grade students on attitude, achievement, multiple intelligence domains and remembering levels by the researcher. This research is an observational case study according to the observations and applications of the researcher as the project manager in terms of showing the application stages and details of the model. Based on this project, a model that can be followed in teaching of music in mathematics instruction and other fields is suggested. Based on the quantitative data, the model proposal developed from this project will enable the use of music in mathematics instruction to be more systematic by freeing it from randomness. This model proposes an interdisciplinary approach as it has strong theoretical foundations based on educational sciences, classroom education, mathematics, music, curriculum development, statistics, measurement and evaluation.

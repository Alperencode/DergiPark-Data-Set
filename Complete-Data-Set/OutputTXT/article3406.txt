Makale Başlığı: (U, V )-Lucas polynomial coefficient relations of the bi-univalent function class
Özet: In geometric function theory, Lucas polynomials and other special polynomials have recently gained importance. In this study, we develop a new family of bi-univalent functions. Also we examined coefficient inequalities and Fekete-Szegö problem for this new family via these polynomials.

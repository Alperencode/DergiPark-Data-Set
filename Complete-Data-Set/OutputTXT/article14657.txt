Makale Başlığı: Households’ Chestnut Purchase and Consumption Behaviors in Atakum District of Samsun Province
Özet: Chestnut is an important crop grown in many countries of the world and has many benefits for human health. The aim of the study was to reveal the households’ chestnut purchase and consumption behaviors. The primary data of the research were obtained from face-to-face surveys conducted with 138 household representatives randomly selected in the Atakum district of Samsun province. In the research, households pay attention to the freshness, taste, sale of chestnuts in hygienic environments and easy peeling of chestnuts. The average annual chestnut consumption of the households was 3.23 kg and their chestnut spending constituted only 0.46% of the total food expenditures of households. There was a statistically significant relationship between the households’ chestnut consumption and the age and gender of household representatives. The older householders consume more chestnuts than the younger one, and male household representatives consume more chestnuts than women household representatives. The most important problems for chestnuts were determined as chestnut internal rot, worm and insect damage. To increase the chestnut consumption, the production and marketing process should be carried out according to the consumers' attention to the chestnut demand.

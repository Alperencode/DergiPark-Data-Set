Makale Başlığı: The Relationship of Agricultural Subsidies and Agricultural Production: Empirical Findings on the Turkish Economy
Özet: The agriculture sector is one of the basic sectors that meets the food needs of people and directs the economy with its various features. In order to solve some of the problems experienced in the agriculture sector, different agricultural policies are carried out in terms of the development and regulation of this sector. One of these policies is agricultural subsidies. There are many types of subsidies in agricultural subsidies. With the increase in the place and importance of agricultural subsidies over time, the effect on agricultural production has become a subject that needs to be investigated. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between agricultural subsidies and agricultural production in the Turkish economy with quarterly data for the period 2006:Q1-2021:Q3. In this study, in which empirical analysis was used, first of all, testing the unit root level of the variables was examined with the ADF unit root test. After testing the cointegration relationship between the variables with the ARDL bounds test approach, DOLS and CCR methods, which are coefficient estimators, were used. As a result of these analyses, it has been determined that agricultural subsidies reduce agricultural production in the short term; however, it has been found that agricultural subsidies increase agricultural production in the long term.

Makale Başlığı: TRIAL OF DEMOCRAT PARTY EDİRNE DEPUTY MÜKERREM SAROL AT YASSIADA
Özet: Mükerrem Sarol, who was in the Parliament as a deputy for Istanbul in the 1950-54 elections and as a deputy of Edirne as a result of the 1957 elections, served in many active duties, especially in the Ministry of State responsible for Press and Broadcasting Affairs during the ten years of the DP’s government. Sarol, whose name is mentioned among the leading officials and who was at the center of the accusations after May 27, was also known for the solution he proposed to Adnan Menderes in the DP Group in 1955, which was referred to as the “Sarol Formula” in the Turkish political literature, and occupied an important place in the intra-party balances. After the May 27, 1960 coup, Mükerrem Sarol was arrested, transferred to Yassıada, and tried in the Supreme Court established here, as were the deputies and prominent administrators of the DP in the country. Known for his affinity to Menderes, Sarol was accused of being abusive by approving laws and amendments to the bylaws, making some speeches outside the Parliament, being on the side of Menderes in the Radio and Homeland Front case, abuse in religious matters, and defending the DP’s opinion. Sarol and his lawyer defended against the charges in Yassıada. With the final decision of the Supreme Court of Justice dated September 15, 1961, he was sentenced to fifteen years of heavy imprisonment for the crime of violating the Constitution, pursuant to Articles 146/3 and 173 of the Turkish Penal Code. He was released on 15 January 1965 based on a doctor’s report due to his chronic illnesses.In this study, the accusations against Mükerrem Sarol and the defenses of Sarol and his lawyer against the allegations were examined by making use of the relevant copyright and examination works, especially the documents of the Republic Archive. The study aims to shed light on both the trial process of Mükerrem Sarol, who was one of the important political characters of the 1950-60 period, and the Yassıada trials in this context.

Makale Başlığı: Isolation of Distinct Lactobacillaceae spp. with Functional Characteristics from Traditional Sourdough Samples
Özet: Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) were isolated from traditional sourdough samples, and functional properties of selected LAB species were determined. Five distinct strains Limosilactobacillus fermentum LR1, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR2, Levilactobacillus senmaizukei CE37, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CE48 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri KD44A were identified following the genotypic discrimination of hundred isolates. Presence of bacteriocin genes in identified species was determined by PCR, and sourdough isolates have been shown to carry bacteriocin genes although they vary according to species. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) production tests showed that the amount of EPS production varies in different media and different incubation conditions. Antimicrobial effects of 5 different LAB species were determined against Bacillus cereus BC 6830, which cause rop problems, and other pathogen species and also molds isolated from bread. Amylolytic activities of isolates, which are important in terms of technological roles, were determined genotypically and phenotypically. Finally, the phytase and phosphatase activities of these species were studied. This study was aimed to unveil the functional sourdough LAB species to be used for industrial purposes.

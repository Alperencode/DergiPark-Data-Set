Makale Başlığı: The Strategic Importance of Tashkent in 19th Century
Özet: Annexed to the Khokand Khanate in the first half of the 19th century, the city of Tashkent was the most important trade centre next to the capital city. It is also a city which is a State within a State and considered to be the most important economic pillar of the whole region. Having a history of 2200 years, the oldest name of the city is “Chach” and “Shash” and, besides, it is also mentioned as “land of Tashkent”, “province of Tashkent”, “Shahar”, “province of Tashkent Steppe of Kypchak” in historic works. An important centre in the Khokand Khanate, Tashkent’s boundaries included Akhangaran, Chinaz, environs of Tashkent, the city and environs of Turkestan situated on the banks of the river Syr Darya, which city is within the territories of Kazakhstan at present. In the second half of the 19th century, the city of Tashkent was again a key point in the Turkestan region, which became a gallant scene for the occupation movements. Once the city of Tashkent had been captured by the Tsarist Russia in 1865, the occupation process gained momentum in the region and the city turned into the centre of the Viceroyalty of Turkestan, which was established in 1867. What we will discuss will be the history and strategic importance as well as political, economic and sociocultural characteristics of the city of Tashkent.

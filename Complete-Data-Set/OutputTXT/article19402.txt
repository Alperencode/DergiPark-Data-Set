Makale Başlığı: CHOCOLATE PRODUCTION, NUTRIENTS AND HEALTH BENEFITS
Özet: Chocolate is defined as the final product formed by grinding the roasted cocoabeans with cocoa butter, and sugar and adding emulsifier and vanilla to thismixture. There are basically three types of chocolate: dark (bitter), milk andwhite. Dark chocolate consists of sugar, cocoa butter, and cocoa liquor. Milkchocolate consists of the same ingredients as dark chocolate but contains milk(milk powder). White chocolate, on the other hand, consists of sugar, cocoa butterand powdered milk, but no cocoa liquor. In this article dark chocolate productionprocesses such as mixing and thinning, conching and tempering wereinvestigated. Recent studies on nutrients and health benefits of chocolate werediscussed as well.

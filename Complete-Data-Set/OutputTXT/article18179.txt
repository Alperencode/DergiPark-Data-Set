Makale Başlığı: PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE TURKISH VERSION OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF GROUP RESPONSIBILITY OF COO-PERATION IN LEARNING TEAMS
Özet: The Questionnaire of Group Responsibility of Cooperation in Learning Teams (CRCG) was developed to assess university students' responsibility and cooperation skills in learning teams. The presented study aims to develop a Turkish version of the CRCG and to analyze its psychometric properties. The original scale was translated into Turkish and back-translated into English. Participants consisted of 231 (152 women, 79 men) university students. Cronbach's alpha of this questionnaire was high, indicating excellent internal consistency. The temporal reliability of the Turkish version of the CRCG and its convergent validity with the Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire was acceptable. The confirmatory factor analysis results pointed out that the two-factor structure of the test provided valid results. Taken together, all these results indicate that the questionnaire has good psychometric characteristics. As a result, the Turkish version of CRCG enables researchers and professors to measure students' responsibility and cooperation skills in learning teams.

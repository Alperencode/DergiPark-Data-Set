Makale Başlığı: The Symptoms Experienced by COVID-19 Patients Following the Recovery
Özet: Purpose: Patients discharged after recovering from COVID-19 continue to experience symptoms. For this reason, in order to carry out sufficient studies regarding the determination and treatment of symptoms experienced after COVID-19 disease, the studies should also focus on the post-recovery period. The study was conducted to determine the symptoms experienced by individuals, who were diagnosed with COVID-19, after recovery. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and recovered in a province in Turkey between April and June 2021. While a total of 1940 people participated in the study, 1443 people who met the criteria were included. The data were collected with a questionnaire form and symptom analysis form prepared by the researchers. Findings: 97.7% of people with COVID-19 experience at least one symptom. The most common symptoms are having fatigue/weakness, bone or joint pain, headache, feeling anxious, forgetfulness, and back pain, respectively. Furthermore, it was found out that the symptom burden experienced by individuals after recovery was also associated with the number of chronic diseases they had. Conclusions and Recommendations: It is important to follow up people who recover and have potential risk factors, especially chronic diseases and obesity, in the early period after COVID-19.

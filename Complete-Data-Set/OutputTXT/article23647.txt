Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Effect of Different Polishing Systems on the Color Change of the New Alkasite Restorative Material
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the color changes of alkasite used as dental fillings polished with different systems that occur on the 24th hour and seventh day after exposure to a discoloration agent.Materials and Methods: Alkasite material which was placed in Teflon molds with a diameter of 8 mm and a height of 2 mm, was polymerized under the application of mylar strip, and a total of 30 samples were obtained (n=10). Materials were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group 1 was polished with diamond grain polishing rubbers (Twist Dia; Kuraray, Japan) and group 2 was polished with Aluminum oxide discs (Sof-Lex; 3M ESPE, MN, USA). Polishing system was not applied in group 3. The first color measurement was performed using a spectrophotometer. The second and third color measurements were completed with the same device at 24th hours and 7th days after immersion in coffee. Color changes (ΔE00) were determined using the CIEDE2000 color formula. The results were analyzed at 95% confidence interval using one-way ANOVA and Tukey test.Results: A statistically significant increase was observed for all groups when ΔE00 values were measured between 24 hours and 7 days. While the lowest mean color change values were observed in group 2 after 24 hours (p < 0.001), there was no statistically significant difference between the polishing systems used on the 7th day (p > 0.05). The control group showed the highest color change values (p < 0.001).  Conclusion: The color stability of the alkasite was affected by the polishing procedure and the immersion time in the colorant agent.

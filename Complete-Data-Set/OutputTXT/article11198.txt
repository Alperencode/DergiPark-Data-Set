Makale Başlığı: Alginate in usage biomedical areas
Özet: Alginate is a biomaterial that can be easily integrated into many application areas such as biomedical, pharmaceutical, engineering, due to its favorable properties such as biocompatibility and ease of gelation. Alginate polymers are used in tissue engineering (preserving structural similarity in tissues to extracellular matrices) applications in many pharmaceutical-based applications. In this review study, it is aimed to give information about alginate, its chemical structure, general properties, morphological properties of alginate sources, extraction methods, especially its use in the biomedical field.

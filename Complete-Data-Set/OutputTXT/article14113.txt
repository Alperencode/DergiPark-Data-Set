Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Economic Freedom and Economic Growth: The Example of China
Özet: IIn this study, the effect of economic freedom on economic growth between 1995 and 2020 in the sample of China, which joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, was examined. In the study, market openness, which consists of the components of trade freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, is used to represent economic freedom, unlike the literature. As a result of the analyzes made with FMOLS and CCR methods in the study, it was concluded that trade and investment freedoms have a positive effect on economic growth, while financial freedoms have a negative effect on economic growth. In addition, the causality relationship between the variables was examined with the Granger causality method in the study and it was concluded that there was a one-way causality relationship from trade, investment and financial freedom to economic growth. The results show that if the policies implemented for trade and investment freedoms are continued and expanded, positive results will be achieved on economic growth. Within the scope of financial freedom, the results show that China should reduce government controls and implement the necessary policies within the framework of international rules in order to liberalize the financial sector. It is considered important to pay particular attention to the efficiency of the banking sector in the policies to be implemented to expand financial freedoms.

Makale Başlığı: Chantal Mouffe and Jurgen Habermas' Approach to Democracy
Özet: Habermas forms the deliberative understanding of democracy through the conceptualizations of "communicative action" and "public sphere". He claims that the functioning of democracy will increase in the new agonistic structure where the structure of the political based on antagonisms is preserved, the state of conflict is neutralized and the enemy turns to "grant". This article aims to compare Mouffe and Habermas' understanding of Radical and Deliberative democracy. The main conclusion reached in the study in which the comparative and qualitative descriptive method was used: Although the aim of both approaches is to seek a democracy with high representation quality and better functioning; Habermas's claim that this communicative action will result in a definite consensus, surpassing the conflicting or competitive structure of the public sphere with the importance he attributes to communication and the rationality of the individual, has facilitated its qualification as a utopian approach. On the other hand, Mouffe developed a more realistic democracy approach by considering the divisions created by the sense of identity and belonging in the society, while the conflict is against competition, the enemy opponent's opponent; that is, it has taken an incomplete approach to the means and how to convert antagonisms to agonism.

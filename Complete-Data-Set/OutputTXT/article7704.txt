The participants of this research, which aims to compare metaphors created by teachers in Turkey and abroad, consist of 224 teachers. In the study, the content analysis method has been adopted, and the data have been collected through a fixed form questionnaire. According to the results of the research, it has been found out that eTwinning projects have mostly been carried out by teachers working at primary schools. The metaphors produced by teachers for eTwinning projects have been grouped under 8 different categories. Lastly, teachers also use various tools while carrying out their projects.

Makale Başlığı: Securitizing Migration in the Context of Human Rights
Özet: Today immigration has taken on an international character due to reasons such as poverty, global war policies, internal conflict, terrorism, global climate crisis and cultural conflicts. Countries have had to develop new policies depending on the increasing number of immigrants and refugees. While some countries recognize the economic, political and social rights of irregular migrants, some countries have considered immigration within the scope of security and followed anti-immigrant policies. In this study, political discourses, international developments, human rights law, immigrant rights and citizenship issues, which are effective in the securitization of immigration due to the increasing number of immigrants, are examined. With the process of securitization of migration, the answer to the question of whether human rights demands received a reasonable response from developed countries has been sought. For this reason, security theories have been examined since the 1980s, and these theories have been divided into two within the framework of classical and contemporary approaches. Based on the new security solutions developed by contemporary approaches, immigrants are also evaluated within this scope. In addition, human rights documents, contracts related to immigrants, citizenship law and immigration rights law were examined.

Makale Başlığı: Teaching Noun Case Suffixes and Gerund Infinitives in Teaching Turkish as a Foreign Language
Özet: The increase in the immigrant population in our country and the number of students coming to get university education in recent years has led to more emphasis to be put on teaching Turkish as a foreign language. The increase in centers teaching Turkish, the diversity of textbooks and the efforts to meet the demand in this field are pleasing. However, the order of teaching grammar structures in Turkish teaching sets differs and according to the expert opinions, learners cannot establish the connection in between as the teaching of successive grammatical structures is done intermittently, and thus, they can’t realize the relationship between the structures that are the continuation of each other. In this study, the way and timing of teaching noun case suffixes and gerund infinitives in Turkish teaching sets were examined. The aim of the study is to determine at what level and in what way these two grammar structures are taught in the determined Turkish teaching sets, and to determine the levels at which these structures should be taught, how and in which order they should be explained.In the study, document analysis, which is a qualitative research method, was used. Yeni Hitit Yabancılar İçin Türkçe teaching set, Gazi Yabancılar İçin Türkçe teaching set, Yedi İklim Türkçe Yunus Emre Enstitüsü teaching set, and İstanbul Yabancılar İçin Türkçe teaching set were determined as documents to analyze. It was determined that in the examined teaching sets, the noun case suffixes are at the A1 level while gerund infinitives are at different levels, that is, the two interrelated structures are addressed independently from each other, the teaching is done intermittently, and the connection that learners can make between the structures is not sufficiently specified. In the study, it is shown with examples that these structures are interconnected and how they should be explained successively at the same level.

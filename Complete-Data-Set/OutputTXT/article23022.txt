Makale Başlığı: The Study Quran: A New Translation and Commentary edited by Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Caner K. Dagli, Maria Massi Dakake, and Joseph E. Lumbard
Özet: The Study Quran (SQ) is a painstaking endeavor that takes several years before it is completed. This study consists of an introduction, Qurʾān translation, a synopsis of certain commentaries, and essays explaining the sacred text’s place and thought in Islam. Recently, the topics that are discussed include “How to Read the Qurʾān” and “Islamic Views on the Qurʾān” to “Al-Qurʾān Ethics, Human Rights, and Society,” as well as “The Qurʾān and Sufism” and “Commentary on the Qurʾān.” This essay involves introductions and maps that exceed 2,000 pages to reconstruct the Battle of Badr and the Conquest of Makkah. However, the editors’ preference and approach to translating the Islamic text, inclusion of commentary, and a map of each of these elements were selected to understand the Qurʾān properly.

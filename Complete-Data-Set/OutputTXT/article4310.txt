Makale Başlığı: MARITIME PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDY ON EVALUATION  OF SEAFARERS AGGRESSION TENDENCIES
Özet: Rapid development in technology and regulations due to major incidents and accidents in the maritime sector challenges seafarers now more than ever. Technological, educational, and other significant changes in the seafaring industry have increased professional and social demands at sea and compelling the psychosocial wellbeing of seafarers. In this study, we aimed to investigate and determine how severe the mental state of Turkish mariners and its expected effects on the maritime community. Life on-board can be utterly stressful and many studies, show that there is a correlation between stress and aggression along with other undesirable mental conditions. It was reached reasonable outcomes about aggression levels of Turkish Seafarers with the use of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Firstly, Cronbach’s Alpha values have been calculated for each scale of the test, then a conformity factor analysis has been carried out. Results of the questionnaire have been evaluated regarding sample groups of gender, rank, educational institution, and vocational ship type. When the questionnaire scales on physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility were examined, significant differences have been found on verbal aggression regarding gender and the difference in educational institutions and on anger depending on rank.

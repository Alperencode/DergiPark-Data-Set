Makale Başlığı: SOME MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS AND HEAVY METAL ACCUMULATION IN MUSCLE TISSUE OF Ruditapes decussatus (Linnaeus, 1758)
Özet: This study aimed to investigate some morphological features and heavy metal accumulation in muscle tissue of Ruditapes decussatus (Linnaeus, 1758) in the spring and autumn seasons of 2018 in the Yumurtalık Coastline of İskenderun Bay located in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. To this end, shell length (SL), total weight (TW), shell height (SH), shell inflation (SI), shell weight (SW), roundness index (RI), cup index (CI) and total length-weight relationship (LWR) of Bivalvia and heavy metal accumulation in the muscle tissue of Bivalvia were measured for two seasons. Minimum and maximum values of SL, TW, SH, SI, SW, RI and CI were determined as 21.50-39.00 mm, 0.80-22.15 g, 10.50-28.70 mm, 9.11-20.90 mm, 3.08-4.66 g, 1.03-2.14 and 0.58-0.67 respectively. The relationship between total length and total weight of R. decussatus was calculated to be W=0.0052*SL2.54 for spring and W=0.0031*SL2.88 for autumn. The growth type of Bivalvia specimens was determined as isometric growth (2.971). Heavy metal accumulation in the muscle tissue in spring and autumn seasons was found as statistically significant only for zinc and copper in different seasons (P<0.05). Biometric data of Bivalvia speciemens and muscle tissue heavy metal level are given and discussed in comparison with the results obtained from other studies. Considering the height-weight relationship, growth type and tissue heavy metal accumulation, it can be said that this area is ecologically suitable for R. decussatus.

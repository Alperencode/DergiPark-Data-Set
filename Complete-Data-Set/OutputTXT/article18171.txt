Makale Başlığı: A FRAME OF HOPELESSNESS IN ENGLISH MODERNIST POETRY
Özet: Modernist poetry has been regarded as an articulate aesthetic mechanism with a beautiful expression of ugly occurrences of the modern epoch. Premised on the multiple debates about human beings’ social, mental, philosophical, or religious issues, modernist poetry conveys people’s conditions during turbulent times. Such eminent figures of English modernist poetry like Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888-1965), Thomas Hardy (1840-1928), Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889), and William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) portray the gloomy atmosphere of the period in their works. Therefore, their poems embody the idea of pessimism and hopelessness. Pessimism and hopelessness in their poems will be analysed through the themes of loss of identity and meaning, sense of insecurity, fragmentation, and lack of communication or inadequacy of language to convey a message.

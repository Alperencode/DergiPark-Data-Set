Makale Başlığı: THE CASE OF ABBREVIATIONS IN LANGUAGE:  A COMPLEX PROCESS OF DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
Özet: Abbreviation, which is described as a common word formation method for today’s languages, is defined as the process of removing certain units from a word and/or a phrase (Plag, 2002, p. 160). Since the ways of applying the abbreviation process to the base form are different from each other, this process is considered as an upper process that includes more than one sub-processes, which reveals the complex nature of the abbreviation phenomenon in the language. As a reflection of the complex nature mentioned earlier, the different categories of sub-processes listed under the abbreviation process show that they were grounded on different parameters. This case of abbreviation, which is a complex process of derivational morphology, result in the fact that there is no general consensus in terminologization of the process, especially in sub-processors. In this study, abbreviations are discussed in terms of definition, features, common and seperate categories of abbreviations are described with examples within the framework of the relevant literature, the criteria and parameters they are based on and the general view that emerges is discussed by synthesizing.

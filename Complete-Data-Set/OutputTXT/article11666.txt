Özet: Objective: Periods of crisis, fear, and stress target hypothalamic-gonadal axis of women in reproductive age and can have an impact on menstrual symptoms. This study was conducted to evaluate menstrual cycle, premenstrual syndrome and anxiety in midwifery students with or without COVID-19 disease.Methods: In this descriptive and comparative study, 216 young girls infected with COVID-19 in the last 6 months were compared with 634 midwifery students, who were not infected yet. “Personal Description Form”, “Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS)” and “State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)” were used to collect data. Results: In the study, it was determined that the mean scores of PMSS and STAI of midwifery students, who had COVID-19 disease were higher than those who did not. It was determined that the difference between the mean scores of PMSS and STAI of midwifery students had COVID-19 was statistically significant, while the difference between the mean scores of PMSS and STAI of midwifery students who did not have COVID-19 disease was not statistically significant. The difference between the prolongation of the two cycle intervals and the reduction of menstrual bleeding in midwifery students with and without COVID-19 disease was found to be statistically significant.Conclusion: The difference between the prolongation of the two cycle intervals and the reduction of menstrual bleeding in midwifery students with and without COVID-19 disease was found to be statistically significant. In addition, the study revealed that being diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the premenstrual symptoms and anxiety levels of single young girls.

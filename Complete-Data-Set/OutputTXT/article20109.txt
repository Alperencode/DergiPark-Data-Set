Makale Başlığı: QURAN OF THE FAJR,SHAFAQ IN THE QURAN AND SUNNAH
Özet: When examining the Qur'an carefully, we witness that – in particular with respect to imsak and iftar – incredible details are given about prayer times. However, reviewing the existing literature on the subject, we see that the concepts that we will examine in detail have been given very general meanings, such that the detailed information given in the Qur'an has been overlooked. Since the Qur'an is a universal Book with verses that are of universal nature, it is expected to provide information applicable for the entire glo-be, whether we are walking on Earth, are on space travel or on an airplane. This has, however, not been possible today, and there has been confusion and even chaos about prayer times. The present article is based on two pillars: the examination of the relevant verses of the Qur'an and the photographing of the sky in the time periods related to these verses. The main purpose of this study is to eliminate the question marks about imsak, sahur and iftar times in Ramadan and to reveal the methods of observation for these times.

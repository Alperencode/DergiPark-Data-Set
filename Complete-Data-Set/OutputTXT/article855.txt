Makale Başlığı: The “Sacred” Politics and Criticism of Marriage
Özet: Marriage is based on a social and economic domination, although the choice of two adult individuals to live together is sanctified by being mystified with feelings of love, compassion, passion. The legal framework of marriage, on the other hand, gives the marriage a contractual character. As a result of this contractual nature of marriage, marriage is built as an area where duties and responsibilities are shared for couples. However, the patriarchal share of marriage includes domination and oppression within the areas of responsibility for women. Therefore, there are different areas of experience for men and women in the marital relationship. For this reason, for a good analysis in marriage studies, the patriarchal boundaries, power relations and compulsory structure of marriage should be taken into consideration. In this study, the practice of marriage is discussed based on the perception of holy marriage, the transformation of marriage into destiny, the feminization of labor within the scope of domestic gender roles, political economy and sexual domination.

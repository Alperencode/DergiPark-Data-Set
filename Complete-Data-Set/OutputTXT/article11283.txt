Makale Başlığı: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MURABAHA AND MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS
Özet: The concept of murabaha is expressed as cost plus profit share sales. Murabaha, known as the participationfinance product, has an important place in the interest-free financial system. In this context, it is aimedto reveal the relationship between murabaha and macroeconomic variables on the Turkish sample in thisstudy. In the research model, murabaha is used as a dependent variable, while Gross Domestic Product(GDP), employment rate, and inflation rate have been tested as independent variables within the scopeof macroeconomic indicator. A total of 40 quarterly data between 2010-2019 have been analyzed usingthe Johansen cointegration, VECM Granger and Toda-Yamamoto causality test. According to the findingsobtained from the analysis, murabaha and macroeconomic variables are statistically identical in the longterm and move in the same direction together. According to the findings obtained from the Toda-Yamamotoanalysis, a bidirectional causality has been found between murabaha and the GDP and employment rate,which is used as a macroeconomic indicator, while a one-way causality relationship has been found betweenmurabaha and the inflation rate. The results indicate the existence of a long-run causality relationshipbetween murabaha financing and various macroeconomic dynamics.

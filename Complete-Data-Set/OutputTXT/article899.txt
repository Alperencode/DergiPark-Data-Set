Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Circular and Regulation Changes Implemented by the Ministry of National Education in the Covid-19 Epidemic Process in terms of Managers
Özet: This study aims to evaluate the circular and the regulation changes made by the Ministry of National Education by the school administrators during the Covid-19 epidemic period in Turkey. The participants of the study, which is patterned by qualitative research management, are school administrators working in public schools located in the Finike district of Antalya Province and affiliated to the Ministry of National Education. A semi-structured interview form based on the conceptual framework and expert opinions was used to collect the data with a document review. The data collected by the document review method is divided into three themes: distance education, measurement and evaluation practices and personnel personal rights. In the semi-structured interview form, a problem related to each theme was addressed to the participants, and the responses were evaluated using the descriptive analysis method and data diversification was performed. The school administrators stated that the amendments to the regulations made by the Ministry of National Education during the Covid-19 pandemic period and the circulars put into effect did not solve the problems in the field, and that unity in measurement and evaluation practices could not be achieved. On the theme of personal rights of personnel, they stated that the changes made by the Ministry were positive.

Makale Başlığı: A New Outdoor Learning Geodesic Dome School Design
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to ensure that out-of-school learning environments for a sustainable environmental education in our world, which is under the threat of global warming, are started to be implemented in science and mathematics disciplines as of pre-school period, apart from primary, secondary and high school levels. The procedures for obtaining permission for school managers and teachers, high operating costs, seen as dangerous and a waste of time for parents are the problems of reaching out-of-school learning environments. In order to eliminate these problems, a school model was designed, which is located in the school garden, with an architecture in the form of an atomic model and included workshops created as a geodesic dome.

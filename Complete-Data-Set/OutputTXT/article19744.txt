Makale Başlığı: Coming Out of the Closet while Coming-of-Age:  The Construction of Gay Male Sexuality in Edmund White’s A Boy’s Own Story
Özet: Published in 1982, Edmund White’s A Boy’s Own Story isa bildungsroman of a young boy remembering his past and sexualinitiation. While the novel traces the narrator’s experiences of growinginto a young man, it also includes glimpses of gay men’s experiencesin the U.S during the mid-20th century. This article attempts to analyzethe character’s journey of sexual discovery as part of his identityconstruction and details how this development of sexuality differsfrom the same-sex sexualities in the bildungsroman tradition. Duringhis coming of age and self-growth process, the character’s sexualdiscovery is affected by the presence of the father figure. Due to thisfigure, the protagonist becomes attracted to his first love, Kevin. Inlight of the theoretical framework on the bildungsroman, gay sexuality,masculinity, and the oedipal triangle, this article examines the way themain character’s discovery of his attraction to Kevin is shaped by hisrelationship to his father. And this leads to the discovery of both himselfand his sexuality during the process of transitioning from boyhood togay manhood, where his sexuality becomes a part of his identity.

Makale Başlığı: PRIORITIZATION OF MAINTENANCE METHODS IN RAIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY
Özet: Purpose: This study is aimed to prioritize rail systems with multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) by examining the studies in the literature to evaluate the maintenance methods used in rail transportation systems in terms of efficiency.Methodology: By examining the effects of maintenance methods on efficiency, the criteria that affect transportation efficiency are determined. The determined criteria were calculated by MCDM methods.Findings: In this study, efficiency in terms of maintenance was analyzed and the priority of 10 criteria to affect efficiency was determined. As the maintenance methods to be preferred in PROMETHEE results, predictive maintenance is the first method with an average current value of 0.8634 and  other maintenance applications; active maintenance (0.2437), periodic maintenance (0.1377), preventive maintenance (0.0685), and opportunity maintenance (0.0396) follow it. It has been determined that operator maintenance (-0.4353), on-site maintenance (-0.4549), and corrective maintenance (-0.4627) applications with negative average current values are not preferred.Originality: The PROMETHEE application applied in the study is an original study on the efficiency of the maintenance methods used in rail transportation systems.

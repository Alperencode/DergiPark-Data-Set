Makale Başlığı: Apert sendromlu bir bebekte trakeostomi için anestezi uygulaması
Özet: Apert syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited disease characterized by irregular craniosynostosis and some malformations involving face, hands and feet. Respiratory functions are frequently deteriorated due to hypoplasia of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cavities. Obstructive sleep apne syndrome, cor pulmonale and sudden death syndrome are among the complications of Apert syndrome. All of these anatomical and physiopathological disorders in the airways lead to a significant concern during anesthesia practice. Difficulty in mask ventilation, difficult intubation and postoperative airway obstruction may be seen in these patients. In this case report we present our anesthetic experience in an infant with Apert syndrome whom anesthesia was given for tracheostomy and difficult intubation was encountered.

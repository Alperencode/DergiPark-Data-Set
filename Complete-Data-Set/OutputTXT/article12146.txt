Makale Başlığı: In vitro antibiotic susceptibility of Brucella strains isolated from patients in the Trakya region
Özet: Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the species of Brucella strains and to investigate in vitro antimicrobials agains doxycycline, rifampicin, streptomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.Method: 42 Brucella species were isolated from clinical specimens (41 from blood culture and one from cerebrospinal fluid) of patients at the Trakya University Hospital. Of the 42 Brucella isolates tested, 41 were identified as Brucella melitensis and one as Brucella abortus with the use of the conventional methods. The efficacy of antibiotics was compared with the agar dilution method at two different pH values (pH: 5 and pH: 7) at the end of 48 and 72 hours of incubation period. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were evaluated as suggested in the ‘Eucast Discussion Document E.Dis 6.1’ prepared for antibiotic susceptibility testing of intracellular pathogens.Results: At the end of the incubation period of 48 and 72 hours at pH: 7 were compared, it was seen that only ofloxacin’s MIC50 and MIC90 values increased twice. While the efficacy of rifampicin increased at pH: 5 after an incubation period of 72 hours, the efficacy of doxycycline did not change and the efficacy of streptomycin,Conclusion: In our study, doxycycline was found to be the most effective antibacterial drug at pH: 5 and pH: 7, according to MIC90 values after an incubation period of 48 and 72 hours. Brucellae are facultative intracellular microorganisms and when we simulated intracellular pH: 5, we determined that the efficacy of streptomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin decreased. This condition should be considered in the treatment of brucellosis.

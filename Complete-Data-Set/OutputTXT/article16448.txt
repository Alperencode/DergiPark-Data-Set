Makale Başlığı: A Phenomenological Analysis of the Relationship between Death and Euthanasia from The Nurse’s Perspective
Özet: This study aimed to understand and make sense of the relationship between death and euthanasia from a sociological perspective. This relationship was assessed through the analysis of thoughts and experiences of nurses about the concepts of death, euthanasia and the terminally ill. The phenomenological methodological approach, as one of the qualitative research methods, was used in this research. Snowball sampling was used to reach 20 nurses, in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview form, and the data were analyzed. In the study, it was seen that the nurses’ perception of euthanasia fell mostly within the category of “voluntary euthanasia”, and their thoughts on the implementation of euthanasia were mostly positive. However, the participants were hesitant about the practice of euthanasia. In the study, it was seen that nurses defined death as an “end”, terminally ill patients as “terminal-period patients and severe patients such as cancer”, and death by euthanasia through the “distinction between natural and artificial death”. The data gathered in this research regarding nurses’ thoughts and experiences about death, euthanasia and the terminally ill were analyzed within the theoretical framework of Foucault and the discussion was built on concepts of biopolitics, medical gaze, and medicalization.

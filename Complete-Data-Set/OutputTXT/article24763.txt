Makale Başlığı: Perceptions of Infection Control Practices and the use of Vignettes to Alter Infection Control Behavior: A Feasibility Study
Özet: DOI: 10.5152/FNJN.2019.19005Aim: To explore the perceptions ofinfection control practices among healthcare personnel and evaluate the use ofauthentic vignettes as a means to alter infection control behavior.Method: Four authentic vignettes were usedas a part of reflective dialogues with healthcare personnel. An evaluation ofthe dialogues was performed with six healthcare personnel using the focus grouptechnique. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data.Results: The mind-set to help one anotherand do one’s best in every situation was described as a core aspect inpreventing the transmission of microorganisms. Having support, taking personalresponsibility, being knowledgeable about infection control practices, andhaving a reasonable workload were seen to play decisive roles in controllingthe spread of infection. Discussing authentic comprehensible vignettes withcolleagues during the allotted time was considered a valuable method forimproving infection control practices.Conclusion: Meaningful insights on how bestto use vignettes as a means to improve infection control practice were gained.These findings should be considered when designing theory-driven interventionsin different contexts, which are aimed at improving infection control practicesin health care.Cite this article as: Lindberg M, Skytt B,Lindberg M.

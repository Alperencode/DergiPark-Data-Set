Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Green Table Olive Processing Methods on Polyphenol Content of Some Turkish Table Olive Varieties
Özet: In this manuscript, some olive varieties having an importance for the Turkish table olive sector such as Ayvalik and Domat variety olives are analyzed in order to determine the types and the amounts of the phenolic compounds of which potential antioxidant activities are extremely high. The effects of the processing techniques on the phenolic compounds belonging to Turkish table olive varieties are found statistically significant in the level of p>0,01. It is determined that the amount of phenolic compounds decreases particularly in the processing of split olive due to the diffusion of phenolic compounds into the brine as well as in the processes of olives with due to the use of caustic, that increases the hydrolysis of polyphenols and diffusion, in order to remove the bitterness of olives.

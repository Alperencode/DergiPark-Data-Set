Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Foreign Direct Investments and Economic Growth: Case of BRICS-T Countries
Özet: Countries need financial resources in order to realize their sustainable economic growth and economic development. This source of financing is an important problem especially for countries that do not have sufficient domestic capital accumulation and have low investment levels. Therefore, one of the alternative external financing sources that countries can use to overcome this problem is foreign direct investment (FDI). The relationship between FDI and economic growth has been discussed many times in the economics literature. However, whether there is a link between these two variables and if there is a link between these two variables, the direction of this is still not clear.The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth in the 1995-2020 period in the example of BRICS-T countries. For this purpose, panel cointegration and panel causality tests were conducted to analyze the relationship between these two variables in the example of BRICS-T countries in the 1995-2020 period. In the example of BRICS-T countries, according to the Westerlund panel cointegration test conducted for the 1995-2020 period, it was concluded that there is a cointegration relationship between the economic growth and FDI variables, and according to the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test results, there is a bidirectional causality relationship between these two variables. The findings obtained from this study are generally compatible with the economic policy propositions of the neoclassical and endogenous growth models, as well as the relevant literature

Makale Başlığı: Deposition of TiO2-Doped Diamond-Like Carbon Films From a New Solution and Their Characterizations
Özet: Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are the most studied coating materials due to their mechanical and physical properties. Manystudies have been conducted on the deposition methods and doping to improve the properties of these films. Among the depositionmethods, the electrochemical deposition has advantages such as convenience and inexpensive equipment. In our previous study, wewere able to produce a titanium dioxide (TiO2) doped DLC film by electrochemical method from a mixture of methanol (CH3OH)and titanium solution obtained by dissolving titanium metal in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this study, TiO2 doped DLC films weredeposited by electrolysis of solutions formed from a mixture of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and methanol. The films deposited attwo different TTIP concentrations were characterized morphologically, structurally and elementally. Scanning electron micrographswere shown that the films are homogeneous and compact. No change was observed in the morphology of the films after annealingthe films at 600 0C. Chemical analyses showed that titanium was in the form of TiO2 and the amount of titanium increased withincreasing TTIP concentration. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that TiO2 was amorphous in the DLC matrix and the film preparedwith lower TTIP concentration had diamond content. After annealing at 600 0C, it was seen that this film was graphitized. Theobtained findings showed that TiO2 doped DLC nanocomposite films can be easily deposited with the solution proposed in this study.

Makale Başlığı: Tendencies of Liking Children Child Development Program Students
Özet: This study was conducted to examine the child development program students' tendency to love children. This study, which was carried out in the province of Mardin in the 2021-2022 academic year, was carried out with the participation of Artuklu University Health Services Vocational School Child Development Program students (N=164). In this quantitative study, scanning model was used. In the study, the Barnett Child Loving Scale, which was developed to measure attitudes towards children, was used as a data collection tool in order to determine child liking tendencies. This scale, which consists of 14 items, has been prepared as seven degrees in total, including the responses of "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree" for each item. The collected data were analyzed with the help of SPSS program. It was determined that the data did not show a normal distribution. For this reason, non-parametric analysis techniques were used in the analysis. According to the findings, it was found that the child development program students had a high level of liking for children. When the relationship between child liking tendencies and some factual variables was examined, no statistically significant difference was found. In line with these data, some suggestions have been made.

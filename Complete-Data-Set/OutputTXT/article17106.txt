While the magnitude of its impact increases the competition between destinations, it also accelerates the efforts to increase the brand value of each destination. One of the factors that positively affect this value is international labels showing that the destination has certain standards, or in other words, they have brand value. At this point, destinations in Turkey are making important efforts to be included in international networks. Standing out with the increasing number of applications in recent years, the UNESCO Creative Cities Network is one of the competitive programs that cities try to be involved in to increase their brand value. With the program based on 7 creative themes, Kastamonu continues to work to become a gastronomy city. In this study, the effects of Kastamonu UNESCO Creative Cities Network preparation process on institutionalization and local development will be evaluated.

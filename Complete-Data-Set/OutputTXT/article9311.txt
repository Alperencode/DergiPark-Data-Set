Makale Başlığı: The outcome of single-visit nonsurgical retreatment and patients’ perception of retreatment: a retrospective cohort study with 1-year follow-up
Özet: Aim: To evaluate the outcome of single visit nonsurgical retreatment by clinical examination and PAI (Periapical Index) and, patients’ feedback regarding the nonsurgical retreatment after 1 year.Material and Method: 115 patients who previously had nonsurgical retreatment were recalled after 1 year and after dropouts, 84 patients were examined clinically and radiographical examinations were completed pre-and postoperatively using Periapical Index. Patients were also asked if they would still choose nonsurgical retreatment for teeth with previously failed root canal treatment.Results: The healing rate after 1 year was 88%. The tooth type did not influence the outcome (p=0.756). While the failure rate was lower in males (3.3%) than in females (16.7%), gender did not affect the outcome (p=0.088). 97.6% of patients had a positive approach to nonsurgical retreatment. There was a statistically significant relationship between treatment outcome and patients' feedback (p=0.013). There is a statistically significant positive correlation between postoperative VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) pain score and postoperative PAI score (p=0.002).Conclusion: Single-visit nonsurgical retreatment is a viable option for teeth where certain periapical diseases such as symptomatic apical abscess are excluded. Patients, who experienced successful nonsurgical retreatment, are eager to preserve their tooth with failed primary root canal treatment when nonsurgical retreatment option is available.

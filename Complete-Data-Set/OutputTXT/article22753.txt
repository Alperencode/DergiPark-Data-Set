Makale Başlığı: A Compilation of Sports Fans' Perceptions of Social Responsibility
Özet: Recently increasing use of social media and communication tools, competition among sports clubs continues outside the field in terms of attracting fans. In this process, corporate social responsibility studies, it is one of the concepts that come to the fore as an indicator of corporate image. In this study, it is aimed to analyze the factors affecting the perception of fans in a multivariate manner, within the framework of the literature on social responsibility studies in Turkish sports clubs. In this framework, studies on social responsibility in sports were analyzed with content analysis methods and the findings were evaluated with semiotic analysis methods. According to the results obtained, Turkish sports clubs do not have sufficient and regular quantitative data sharing regarding corporate social responsibility projects, and since the clubs are listed on the stock exchange, in the annual reports they publish, a large proportion of the clubs belong to sports club associations and the dividends transferred to these associations can actually be expressed as social responsibility. For this reason, he actually states that his own activities are a social responsibility project. On the other hand, it has been reported that there is a direct relationship between the dimensions of economic responsibility, legal responsibility, ethical responsibility and philanthropy responsibility and the corporate image perception of the supporters, and it has been revealed that all dimensions of corporate social responsibility studies are understood with a high level of consistency by the fans. Studies conducted in the literature, financial and material aid and aid to those in need are at the forefront of social responsibility areas in Turkish sports clubs, and the club president has the most decision-making authority on social responsibility aids or participations. More studies are needed to reveal the perception of fans in sports clubs, and it is seen that there is a need for more transparent and accountable information on participation in corporate social responsibility activities on the club side, as well.

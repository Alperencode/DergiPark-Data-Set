Özet: One of the concepts trying to explain today's society is the concept of risk society proposed by Beck (1982). This concept, which refers to the uncertainties that are unnatural and produced (caused) by humans covers the climate crisis and a wide variety of risks that will arise due to it and that will affect life deeply. This study will seek an answer to the following question: What can we do about the transformative role of public relations in providing social change in the context of socio-cultural approach in order to reduce the effects of the climate crisis? It tries to establish a relationship with public relations between sustainability, the climate crisis and our common future. The aim of the study is to focus on the role of public relations in risk management and communication strategies that will reduce the transformation of change as much as our individual lives by creating awareness and persuading the public in preventive behavior changes. The study is based on a literature review. Risk communication policies are created by macro organizations such as governments or institutions but are usually implemented by individuals. This study can contribute to the literature as it opens the transformation of the individual in the prevention of risks to discussion.

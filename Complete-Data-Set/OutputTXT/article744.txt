Özet: The life of the Prophet Muhammad has been a subject that has attracted attention and been studied in the West as well as in the Islamic world. In several theses about the birth and spread of Islam, different explanations have been made as the reason for the acceleration gained in a short time in the conquest movements. As one of these different points of view, Fred McGraw Donner’s views can be summarized as the birth of Islam as a religious movement and an intense interest in attaining personal salvation through virtuous behavior. These comments on the subject are also included in the book of Fred McGraw Donner (Muhammad and the Believers at the Origins of Islam), who carried out his academic studies on the History of Islam . Basically, Donner’s work aims to criticize the view that emerged in the middle of the twentieth century and explains the birth and spread of Islam mainly with social and economic tensions, deals with the issue with a perspective that prioritizes religious bases, makes different definitions about first Muslims and conquerors. In our study, we will examine Donner’s view on the birth and spread of Islam, which opposes contemporary orientalists, in the context of his book

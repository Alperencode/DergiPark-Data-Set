Makale Başlığı: A Overview Of Science Textbooks: Turkish Islamic Scientists
Özet: In this study, the inclusion of Turkish-Islamic scientists who contributed to science in secondary school science textbooks examined. Taking into account the science curriculum prepared by the Ministry of National Education in 2018, the textbooks taught at the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grade levels were examined through document analysis, one of the qualitative data collection methods. As a result of the study, it has been determined that Turkish-Islamic scientists are not included enough in the textbooks taught, but the information given is presented as those who guide science, pioneers of science and reading texts, and that the contributions of Turkish-Islamic scientists to science are only in the textbooks taught in the 5th, 6th and 7th grades. On the other hand, it has been observed that Turkish-Islamic scientists are rarely included in the textbooks taught at the 8th grade level, in which the relevant unit is associated with its subject. It emphasized that the lives of these scientists, the importance of their work and their fields of study should be included in detail by giving more place in the textbooks of Turkish scientists who pioneered the purpose of revealing all scientific methods that could help human nature and contributed to science.

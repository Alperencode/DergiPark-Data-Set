Makale Başlığı: Brand Value Analysis with Hirose Method: An Aplication on Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing Sector
Özet: The consumer-oriented revision of competition rules forces businesses to exhibit more customer-oriented behavior than ever before. The concept of brand, which has a very important place in the process of ensuring sustainable and value-oriented relations of enterprises with their target audiences, is an effective factor in the process of ensuring the awareness, loyalty and perceived quality targeted by the enterprises. For this reason, the value-oriented perspective carries the value measurements of brands to a competitive dimension. Thus, there is a relationship between brand value and competitive structures of businesses, and businesses are making brand investments at an increasing level. The study carried out in this context aims to determine the brand values of the companies included in the Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing Sector in Turkey by using the Hirose Method, which is one of the financial brand valuation methods. The method used in the study is based on the variables expressed as “prestige variable (PD), loyalty variable (LD) and expansion variable (ED) in the process of determining brand value. In the study, 10 companies included in the relevant sector were analyzed, and as a result of the analyzes carried out, the highest value in terms of brand values belonged to ALKA with 1.075.385.020.85 TL; The company with the lowest brand value was found to be IHGZT with 24,740,251.45 TL. In addition, it has been determined that the brand values of all the analyzed companies are below the market values.

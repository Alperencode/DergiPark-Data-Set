Makale Başlığı: RECOGNITION OF CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER TURKISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Özet: With the Kyoto Protocol, which entered into force in 2005, markets were created in which greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming and climate change are bought and sold. In the context of carbon accounting, it is necessary to measure the greenhouse gas emissions, which are the subject of trading in these markets, in a true, fair and reliable way and to transfer the emission information to the financial statements. The aim of this study is to examine the approaches to the transfer of carbon emissions to financial statements within the scope of Turkish Accounting Standards, which are compatible with International Accounting Standards, and to show the effects of these approaches on the financial statements with the case study method.

Makale Başlığı: MOLECULAR INVESTIGATION OF CANINE HEPATOZOONOSIS IN BATMAN AND VAN PROVINCES OF TÜRKİYE
Özet: Canine hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne protozoan disease spread by hard ticks of the Ixodidae family. Although this illness has been seen in numerous locations in Türkiye, its existence in the Batman and Van provinces has yet to be confirmed. The purpose of this research was to look into canine hepatozoonosis in stray dogs from two distinct areas in Türkiye using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Between 2019 and 2021, blood samples were collected from 197 stray dogs in Batman and Van provinces in Türkiye. A unique 486–520 bp segment of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. was amplified using PCR. According to the PCR findings, none of the 197 stray dogs tested positive for Hepatozoon spp. This research offers epidemiological data on the prevalence of canine hepatozoonosis in Türkiye, which may be useful in future studies with larger sample sizes and dogs of varied origins.

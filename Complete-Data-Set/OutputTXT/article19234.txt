Makale Başlığı: The Relationship between Presentation of Artworks of Various Dimensions and Architectural Design in The Scope of The Development of Exhibition Design
Özet: The display has been used from the very beginning to display objects. Exhibition design is a combination of display and contemporary visual communication design. With the development of the exhibition concept and the increase in interdisciplinary cooperation, communication is established by including the space itself in the design. Today, the exhibited products are no longer exhibited, the exhibition itself has become a work of art and the exhibition design has begun to be designed consciously. This change causes you to question what art is and what design is. Within the scope of this research, a descriptive study was conducted to improve the interior design performance in the context of the space requirements of the exhibition space. As a method, in the first stage, an international literature review was conducted using the keyword "exhibition design". In the next step, based on the data obtained, it has been tried to reveal how experience and interaction in exhibition design can produce original results, with examples limited to photography studies and metal/glass works to evaluate works in various dimensions. Thanks to this research, comparisons were made to improve the design performance of the exhibition space, which designers can use as input in the design process. Reproduction of such works will greatly improve the artist's performance in exhibition design and ensure the up-to-date continuity of knowledge and experience sharing in future designs.

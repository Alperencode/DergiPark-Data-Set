Makale Başlığı: Prompting peers’ use of choices to promote communication in children with autism spectrum disorder.
Özet: The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of prompting a preschool student to use choice making with a peer identified with autism spectrum disorder. The researchers used a single case research design. Researchers provided prompting across three thematic play activities. Results show that there was an initial effect in the first activity, which may have resulted in a carry-over effect in the other two activities. While peer-mediated instruction can be an effective meth-od for increasing the dosage of learning opportunities that children with autism spectrum disorder experience in early childhood settings, peers may need more training or ongoing support to sustain their interactions with the child in a meaning-ful way.

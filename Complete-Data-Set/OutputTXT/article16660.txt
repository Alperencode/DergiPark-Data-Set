Makale Başlığı: MEASURING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROVINCES OF THE TRA1 REGION WITH DATA ENVELOPE ANALYSIS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT / Bölgesel Kalkınma Kapsamında Veri Zarflama Analizi İle TRA1 Bölgesi İllerinin Etkinliğinin Ölçülmesi
Özet: As regions gain importance in the global area, development agencies have great responsibilities. In the study, the effects of regional development agencies on development and local economy were examined in the TRA1 region, based on the support of the Northeast Development Agency. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used in the study. The aim of this study; It is to direct RDAs to areas where the private sector is reluctant in the initiative, to mobilize regional dynamics for the creation of new industrial zones, and to evaluate the efficiency-productivity analysis of the DEA and TRA1 region on a provincial basis. In the study, the extent to which KUDAKA contributed to the regional development perspective was evaluated with the help of quantitative data. As a result of DEA, it was determined that Erzurum and Erzincan have effective-fixed scale efficiency, while Bayburt is relatively less efficient with increasing scale efficiency. CCR results were found as 0.31, 1.00 and 1.00 for Bayburt, Erzurum and Erzincan, respectively. In addition, in the study, it is predicted that RDAs are beneficial institutions in both national and local development, and that these structures, which do not have a distant past in Turkey, have some shortcomings, but with the studies to be done, these deficiencies will be eliminated and regional development will reach a more advanced level.

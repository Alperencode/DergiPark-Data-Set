Makale Başlığı: ARIF NIHAT ASYA'S PROSE POEMS
Özet: Arif Nihat Asya, one of the important names of Turkish literature in the Republican Period, never severed his ties with art and literature in the fifty-five years from the 1920s when he became interested in art. Arif Nihat Asya, who is a versatile artist, has made a lot of mention of his name with his works in the field of poetry, but he has an important place in Turkish literature with his works in the field of prose. The artist, who tried genres such as jokes, mensur poetry, travel writing, letters and short prose in the field of prose, collects his works in this field in ten books.Although Asya started its artistic life by writing poetry, its interest in prose poetry, which was frequently preferred by Tanzimat, Servet-i Fünûn and national literary artists, which entered our literature through translations from Western literature especially between 1930 and 1945, increased during this time. The artist, who concentrated on prose poetry between these years, managed to attract the attention of many writers and poets of his time with his works in this genre.In this study, the prose  poems written by Arif Nihat Asya throughout his art life will be examined thematically and technically, and explanations will be made by giving examples of prose  poems.

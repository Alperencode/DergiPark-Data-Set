Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF THE PIANO ACCOMPANY FOR TIMING IN THE "CRUDA SORTE" ARY FROM GIOACHINO ROSSINI'S "L'ITALIANA IN ALGERI" OPERA
Özet: In this study, the timing issues of piano accompaniment in “Cruda Sorte” from “L’italiana in Algeri” by Rossini are identified and solutions to those issues are offered. The method of content analysis is utilized in the research.  In findings, it is seen that four different skills are expected from the accompanist in order to ensure timing harmony. As a result of the analysis, made in the piece, 16 of them are in A type (to match the non-stop beats in the accompaniment part with the non-quiet beats in the soloist's part and to know which rhythms to follow in the soloist's part for this), 12 of them are in the B type (the silenced beats in the accompaniment part and the relevant ones in the vocal part). by matching the beats, to sing the rest of the silence as a continuation of the beats it matches and to know which rhythms the soloist will follow for this, 5 in C type (to be able to stretch the tempo where necessary), and 7 in D type (to be able to return to determined or desired tempos where necessary) Suggestions were made for timing at 40 different points, including the skill.

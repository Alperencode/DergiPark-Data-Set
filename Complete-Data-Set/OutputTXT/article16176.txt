Makale Başlığı: Rahmân in Arabic Poetry of the Period of Jahiliyyah
Özet: Literature is the cultural heritage of a nation, a conveyor of material-spiritual values and the memory of society. The Jahiliyyah poetry, which is part of the literature of its period, is the source of Arabic literature and is a kind of mirror of the Arabs of Jahiliyyah in the pre-Islamic period. For this reason, the concept of Raḥmān is discussed and examined in the Arab poetry of the Period of Jahiliyyah based on the aim of determining whether the concept of Raḥmān is known to Arabs in the pre-Islamic period, what meaning(s) it is used in if it is known, and the conformity of this meaning(s) with the Qur’an. For this purpose, the divans of Jahiliyyah poets of different faiths are scanned and numerous examples of couplets with the word Raḥmān are found. It is observed that the concept of Raḥmān, which is initially used in Pagan culture epigraphs and later in Jewish-Christian epigraphs, with the influence by the belief of tawhid, which found itself especially in Yemen; partly different from its meaning in the Qur’an, with the aim of expressing an absolute creator in a more comprehensive way, is used in the poems of the poets of the Period of Jahiliyyah.

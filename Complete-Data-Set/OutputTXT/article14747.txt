Makale Başlığı: On Ancient Turkish Culture and Civilization: Surviving in the Steppe
Özet: Geography is a great gift for humanity and for this reason, mankind has had the opportunity to develop in various fields. Considering that the Turks have lived in very different geographies since the first day they emerged, this diversity of places belongs to the ancient Turks; It has affected their lifestyles, lifestyles, forming a certain worldview, social structures, in short, their culture and civilization. For this reason, in the historical and cultural studies about the ancient Turks; It would be appropriate to put forward the "steppe" issue, to know and comprehend how the steppe culture was formed by mixing with history and how this geography gave objectivity to the Turkish people living in the steppe, and then to understand Turkish culture and civilization. Of course, while working in the field of old Turkish history and culture, it is necessary to move away from the understanding that it is sufficient to only consider the steppe when talking about the settlements. I believe that it would be more appropriate to conduct a study with this title and content, since the great states that were established were mainly established in the steppe. For this reason, the general character and also the aim of the study is to reveal how the ancient Turks, who started their life adventures in this geography called the steppe, came into existence in the steppe, and how long they lived here by displaying superior success against the natural environment in this vast, flat land. At the same time, this study emphasizes the importance of determining that an integral part of the formation of these structures is the geography they live in, in order to be able to determine the political, economic and social structure of the Turkish communities living in the steppe in the pre-Islamic period. In this article, by making some evaluations on the old Turkish culture and civilization, it will be tried to make important explanations by touching on the general characteristics of the ancient Turks in the pre-Islamic steppe.

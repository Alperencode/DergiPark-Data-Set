Makale Başlığı: The Problem Of Misogyny In The Hıstory Of Philosophy
Özet: The ideology of misogyny, which dates back to ancient times, is generally used to mean having a negative attitude towards women, having a feeling of hatred or hostility. It is possible to say that the mizojini mentality is experienced both mentally and practically in almost every society, from primitive societies to modern societies. Patriarchy is one of the most primitive instruments of domination in human history. Misogyny is a form of ideology or mentality that is born and nurtured by this understanding. The understanding of misogyny has always marginalized women in the face of the male gender, excluding them from almost the entire public sphere, and approached women with a humiliating attitude as if they were second class.Here, the main aim of this study is to discuss the attitude that disregards the “human dignity” created by the ideology of misogyny towards women throughout history. The misogynistic attitude experienced throughout the history of philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle, who are seen as the cornerstones of the history of thought with their ideas; the themes of many philosophers such as Rousseau, Hegel and the thoughts of the age on women will be revealed. In the “Instead of Conclusions” section, it will be discussed whether feminism can be an alternative to change this attitude, which is against human dignity in every aspect and that misogynistic culture or ideology favors women.

Makale Başlığı: The Role of Yemen in Iran’s Security Policy: A Historical and Sectarian Evaluation
Özet: Iran, one of the most important states in the Middle East, shapes its foreign policy by bringing together historical concerns and economic interests. While it wants to initiate its security from outside the borders by the influence of the siege syndrome/siege mentality it also wants to gain groups which is close to its ideological or sectarian identity. Aiming to provide control over the Houthis in Yemen, Iran is trying to maintain energy security by controlling Bab el-Mandeb Strait and neutralize the Saudi Arabia, an important representative of Sunni. This study discusses the strategic importance of Yemen, the relations between the Houthis and Iran, Shi’ism in Iran’s security policies and finally the reflections of the Saudi Arabia-Iranian rivalry in Yemen while aiming to analyze the role of Yemen in Iran’s security policies.

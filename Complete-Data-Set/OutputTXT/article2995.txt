Makale Başlığı: “ON “ILLOGICALITIES” AND “INCOMPREHENSIONS” IN THE NATIVISED TRANSLATION OF ‘IHSÂU’L-ULÛM’ OF AL-FARABI”
Özet: Translation activities have been a great culture service throughout history. In this era, especially the translation of the classical works of the history of Islamic thought, undoubtedly, is of great importance in terms of our scientific life. However, it is obvious that if the necessary care is not taken in the translation of classical texts, extremely disturbing results will emerge. In this criticism, in a text published with the claim of being a Turkish translation of Fârâbî’s İhsâu’l-ulûm, some significant mistakes have been made as a result of both lack of knowledge of Arabic and philosophical inadequacy will be discussed and will be analyzed in detail so that the reader can make better use of it. Our aim is to contribute to the translation of classical texts with the necessary precision and to the development of translation criticism, especially in the field of Islamic philosophy.

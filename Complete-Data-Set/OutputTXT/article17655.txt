Makale Başlığı: AN EVALUATION REGARDING THE ELECTION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND THE OPERATION OF THE BOARD WITHOUT A CHAIRMAN
Özet: The legislator has given several essential duties and powers to the chairman of the board of directors of the joint-stock company. The inability to designate the chairman for any reason, in other words, the absence of any member with the status of chairman, except for the board of directors composed of a single person, may lead to the inability to perform the duties entrusted to the chairman, and ultimately to the inability of the company's management. This study examines the stated clogging situation and focuses on solution suggestions. The study also includes some evaluations regarding the election and qualifications of the chairman of the board of directors and in this context for example, the use of co-optation method in the determination of the chairman, the term of office, who can be elected for what term, and some opinions and discussions on the election of legal entities as chairman.

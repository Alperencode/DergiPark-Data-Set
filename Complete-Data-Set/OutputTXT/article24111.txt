In this study, it is aimed to make a bibliometric analysis of international studies on internal audit. For this purpose, first of all, data on 1,089 studies on internal audit that were scanned in the SCOPUS database, one of the most comprehensive databases for international literature, were obtained. Afterwards, these studies were examined according to the parameters of publication year, author information, research areas, publication types, publication sources, broadcasting institutions, broadcasting countries, keywords and publication languages. In addition, visual network maps of the studies were created through the "VOSviewer" program and their relations with each other were revealed.

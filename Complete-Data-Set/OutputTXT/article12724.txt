Makale Başlığı: Effectiveness of Creative Drama as a Method in Problems Requiring Mathematical Modeling
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of creative drama processes in solving mathematical modeling questions of students. The research was handled in a quantitative design and an experimental design with control group was used. A total of 38 eighth grade students, 19 in the experimental group and 19 in the control group, participated in the research. Before the process, the experimental and the control groups took the preliminary test, the post-test and lastly the permanence test three weeks later. As a result of these tests, it was observed that creative drama workshops increased the success of the students. According to the results of the permanence test, it was concluded that that the success continued. In the light of the findings, it was discovered that the creative drama method and its approaches have positive effects on both success and permanence in the mathematical modeling process.

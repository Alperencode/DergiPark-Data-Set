Makale Başlığı: Current Progress on the Responses of Eggplant to Ultra-Low Temperatures during Production
Özet: Cold stress has an adverse effect on eggplant growth and is a yield-limiting factor. Low temperatures are prevalent during early spring cultivation in temperate climates, and they have a negative impact on eggplant growth and development. Temperatures below the eggplant’s optimum growth temperature (22-30ºC) are considered low and detrimental to growth and development. In this review, we described how eggplants respond to moderately low and cold temperatures at different scales. We compiled literature on the current understanding of physiological, cellular responses to cold stress in eggplant as well as the transcriptional regulation during cold stress. Subsequently, we also highlight the genetic and molecular evidence, particularly the function of cold-responsive genes in strengthening cold tolerance in eggplant. Lastly, we covered the role of mineral nutrients and useful microorganisms in alleviating the consequences of cold stress in eggplant roots. Agronomic management practices such as the use of AMF species may mitigate the detrimental effects of low temperature and the enhancement of crop varieties with high yield throughout cold stress.

Makale Başlığı: DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SOME FOLIAR FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS ON PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF COTTON (Gossypium hirsutum L.) IN ŞANLIURFA ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS
Özet: MAY-505 and MAY-455 cotton seeds were used as plant material in the research. Ravel/Şamar (Solin), Detameta Micromix and Lebosol Nutriphos formed the fertilizer material. The experiment was established and carried out in 3 replications according to the randomized blocks experimental plan. Lebosol Nutriphos, Detabeta Mikromix, Ravel-Şamar foliar fertilizers used in the experiment were used in the recommended amount. As a result of the research; foliar applied nutrients have a significant effect on ginning yield, boll weight, boll seed weight, 100 seed weight, fiber index, boll number, seed yield, fruit branch, wood branch, plant height, fiber length, fiber fineness and fiber strength. However, it was found that it did affect  any   number of woody branches and earliness. The seed cotton yield was 416,00 kg/da from May-505 variety and 419,75 kg/da from May-455 variety.   it was concluded that when the plant nutrients are used in the recommended amount and time, higher yields can be obtained compared to the control treatment.

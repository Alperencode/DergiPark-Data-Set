Makale Başlığı: Frequency of pre- and post-transplant infectious agents in kidney transplant patients
Özet: Purpose: Renal transplantation is the most important and successful treatment method for renal failure. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the frequency of Cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK virus (BKV) and bacterial agents in kidney transplant recipient (KTR)s before and in the first six months after transplantation.Materials and Methods: CMV and BKV were investigated by Real-time PCR in blood samples taken from patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Organ Transplantation Center of our faculty, one week before the transplantation and in the first, third and sixth months after transplantation. Blood, urine, respiratory tract /wound (if necessary) cultures were performed. Decoy cells were evaluated in urine cytology.Results: The mean age of KTRs was 32.60±11.71 years, 28 (62.2%) were male. Donor origins were living related donors 39 (86.7%) and cadaveric 6 (13.3%). After transplantation, BKV was detected in 11/38 (28.9%) patients, CMV was found in 25/41 (60.9%) patients, and Decoy cell positivity was detected in 11/31 (35.4%) patients. While the highest rate of Real-time PCR positivities were in the third months and sixth months for BKV and first, month for CMV and gradually decreased towards the sixth month. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida nonalbicans, Enterococcus faecalis were most commonly grown in urine culture. Staphylococcus hominis, Streptecoccus epidermidis, were grown in blood culture. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans grew in the culture of respiratory tract samples. Conclusion: Bacterial infections developed early in our KTRs. While the highest Real-time PCR positivity rate was in the third and sixth months for BKV, it was the first month for CMV and gradually decreased towards the sixth month. Decoy cell positivity may be also important for diagnosis of BKV infection in KTRs.

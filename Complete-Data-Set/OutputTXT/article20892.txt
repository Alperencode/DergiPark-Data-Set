The analysis of the data was carried out with the Jamovi 2.3.9 program.Findings- When the results of the multiple linear regression analysis were examined, it was observed that the variables of perceivedappropriateness, perceived consistency, perceived effectiveness and entrepreneurship education together had a significant relationship(R=0.83, R2=0.69) with entrepreneurial intention (F(4-149)=82.4, p<0.05). These variables together explain 69% of entrepreneurial intention.When the significance of the regression coefficients of each variable is examined, it is seen that the variables of perceived consistency(β=0.45, p<0.05) and perceived effectiveness (β=0.44, p<0.05) in order of importance are significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention,and perceived appropriateness (β=-0.09, p<0.05) and entrepreneurship education (β=0.11, p>0.05) variables were not found to be significantpredictors.Conclusion- As a result of the research, it was found that the dimensions of perceived consistency and perceived effectiveness had asignificant effect on the entrepreneurial intention of university students; It was determined that perceived appropriateness andentrepreneurship education did not have a statistically significant effect on entrepreneurial intention. The significant effect of the perceivedconsistency dimension on the entrepreneurial intention can be interpreted as the personal values of university students and theirentrepreneurial activities match, and at this point, the entrepreneurial intention is formed. The significant effect of the perceivedeffectiveness dimension on the entrepreneurial intention can be interpreted as the fact that university students see entrepreneurship as asuitable career, which forms the basis for their development of entrepreneurial intention.

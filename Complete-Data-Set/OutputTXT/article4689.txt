Makale Başlığı: Comparing the efficacy of imaging techniques in detecting myometrial invasion, cervical involvement and pelvic lymph-nodal metastasis in endometrial cancer
Özet: Aim: To compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value ofpreoperative imaging techniques for detecting myometrial invasion, cervix involvement, and alsopelviclymph nodal metastasis in endometrial cancerMaterials and Methods: The medical records of patients who underwent an operation for endometrialcancer in the years between 2005 and 2017 were collected from the database at our institution.Preoperative imaging reports of 252 ultrasonography (USG), 89 computerized tomographies (CT),147 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with endometrial cancer, and postoperative pathologicreports were collected and compared.Results: In our study 252 ultrasonography (USG), 89 computerized tomography (CT), 147 magneticresonance imaging (MRI) examinations were evaluated. Among deep myometrial invasion; all imaging modalities have low specificities (respectively 26.7%, 37.9%, and 32.4%) but higher sensitivities(respectively 68.5%, 79.1%, and 89.4%). To rule out cervical invasion all modalities have high andcomparable sensitivities (respectively 98.3%, 95.0%, and 87.0%). On the other hand, USG hassuperiority to detect cervical invasion over CT and MRI (respectively 71.4%, 15.4%, and 22.7%). CT has much highersensitivity than MRI for detection of pelvic lymph node metastasis (87.5% vs 53.1%).Conclusion: Preoperative imaging modalities have high sensitivities for deep myometrial invasion, but low detection rates for cervical involvement and pelvic lymph node metastasis. MRI should be thepreferred modality for myometrial invasion, on the other hand, The USG is much better to detectcervical involvement. CT has superiority on other imaging modalities among lymph node metastasis.

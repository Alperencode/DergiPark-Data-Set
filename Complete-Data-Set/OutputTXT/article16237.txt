Makale Başlığı: Geology and Mineralogy of Yenisofça Opal Occurences, Eskişehir – NW Turkey
Özet: This study presents the geology and mineralogy of the opal nodules which occur in the Pliocene carbonated conglomerates, NW of the Yenisofça village (Eskişehir, NW Turkey). The host-rock of opals consist of well-rounded pebbles, mainly opal, ultramafics (mainly serpentinites), and micritic limestones. The mainly white, transparent and grey colored opal nodules range from 2 to 30 cm in diameter The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed opal- CT, quartz, dolomite and sepiolite as the main mineral components of opals. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that sphere and fibrous textures are found in opal nodules. The comparison of fibrous textures observed in the opal nodules with those observed in sepiolite nodules based on SEM images showed that there is a similarity between them. The major element composition of the opal by SEM and whole rock geochemical analyses reveal that the concentration of the MgO is higher than the other oxides in the opals. Field studies, geochemical analyses, and mineralogical data suggest that the Yenisofça opals could have formed by sepiolite replacement by low temperature silica-rich hydrothermal solutions that circulated along the fractures systems. This result is similar and coherent with the properties and formation of opal and cryptocrystalline quartz occurrences outcropping in the Eskişehir and Kütahya regions.

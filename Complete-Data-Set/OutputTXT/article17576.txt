Makale Başlığı: The Impact of Women’s Entrepreneurship and Gender Inequality on Human Development
Özet: Women’s entrepreneurship plays a crucial role in increasing the effectiveness of leadership, innovation, research and development, and creating job opportunities, competitiveness, productivity, and new industries. The economic contribution generated by women through their entrepreneurship has a critical role in economic growth and sustainability. Gender inequality refers to the situation where women are disadvantaged compared to their male counterparts. Ensuring gender equality is considered one of the key factors in empowering women economically. From these conclusions, this study has been based on the assumption that reducing gender inequality and increasing women's entrepreneurship will affect the human development of societies positively. Therefore, the effects of women's entrepreneurship and gender inequality on human development have been analyzed by using data on women's entrepreneurship, gender inequality, and human development from 76 countries. Study findings have revealed that women's entrepreneurship and gender inequality significantly affect human development. While the effect of women's entrepreneurship on human development is positive, that of gender inequality is negative. It is advisable that countries involve women more in economic and social processes by developing policies to reduce gender inequality, and contribute to human development by supporting women entrepreneurs and encouraging women’s entrepreneurship.

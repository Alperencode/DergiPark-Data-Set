Makale Başlığı: The morphometric and erythrometric analyses of Pelophylaxridibundus living in anthropogenic pollution resources
Özet: The  health  status  of  Pelophylax  ridibundus  species  living  in  anthropogenic  pollution  sources  in  Erzurum  (Turkey)  were  investigated. Firstly, heavy metal concentrations in liver of the frog species, and in water and sediment samples taken from the habitats of  the  frogs  were  determined  by  instrumental  analysis.  Secondly,  morphometric  (fluctuating  asymmetry-FA,  hepatosomatic  index-HSI)  and  erythrometric  analyses  were  performed  to  reveal  the  health  status  of  the  frogs  in  the  areas.  Our  study  provides  the  first  morphometric  datas  on  the  frog  in  Turkey.  Although  the  metal  concentrations  in  the  water  were  high,  it  was  determined  that  they  did not exceed the limit values. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, and As metal concentrations in the sediment were determined to be above the acceptable level. It was also found that some metals accumulated in the livers of the frog due to heavy metal pollution. On the other hand, the FA, HSI values and the erythrocytic nuclear abnormality frequency increased in the frogs living in polluted stations. Moreover, erythrocyte size decreased and nucleated erythrocyte, mitotic erythrocyte, pycnotic erythrocyte, and immature erythrocyte frequencies increased. It was found that there was a correlation between the presence of pollution and the health status of the frogs, and the frog populations were affected negatively by anthropogenic pollution.

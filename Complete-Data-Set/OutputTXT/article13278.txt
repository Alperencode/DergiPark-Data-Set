Makale Başlığı: Migration and language acquisition: A review on current situation and education policies in Turkey
Özet: Migration is a phenomenon that deeply affects both the migrating individuals and the host country and causes cultural, social and political changes in the lives of individuals. Although it is difficult to predict the long-term effects of migration, it is known that integration has benefits for both parties. In order to be able to talk about a true integration, it is a must for immigrants to learn the language of the host country. Language acquisition will facilitate the adaptation of the immigrant to the new environment and will pave the way for the effective use of his rights. Turkey, which hosts the largest number of immigrants in the world with the effects of the Syrian Civil War, puts a big test in many areas such as health, education and employment. In this context, in this study, the current situation in Turkey and the applied education policies were examined within the framework of migration and language acquisition. In addition, international and national texts regulating the education rights of immigrants are presented in the study. It is a sad fact that the targeted schooling rate and thus the expected level of social cohesion could not be reached, although there are serious studies on the language acquisition and schooling of immigrants in Turkey. For this reason, it is recommended to increase the scientific researches to be done in this field and to develop new education policies for what can be done in the current situation by examining sample applications from other countries.

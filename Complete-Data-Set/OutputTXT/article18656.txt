Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Consolidation Results of Arabic Gum Added Natural Clay Soil
Özet: The availability of alternative materials that do not harm the nature, instead of the additives that are widely used to improve soils, has been the subject of research. In this study, the usability of the biopolymer (Arabic Gam-AG), which is an alternative to the commonly used additives of natural clay soil, in soil improvement was investigated. Time dependent settlement behavior of natural clay soil with and without AG biopolymer was investigated. In this context, the consolidation test was carried out for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days curing periods by making wet mixture of 1%, 2%, and 3% by weight of the natural clay soil sample. As a result of the consolidation test, the consolidation test data of the natural clay soil and the samples prepared by adding AG biopolymer to the natural clay soil were compared. With this study, it was concluded that AG biopolymer positively affects the settlement behavior of natural clay soil. In addition, since AG is a natural material, it has been determined that the engineering properties of such soils can be improved without causing any damage to the environment.

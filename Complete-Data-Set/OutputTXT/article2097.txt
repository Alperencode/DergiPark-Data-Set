The data were collected by the ‘’Information Form’’ and the‘’ Health Literacy Scale’’. Descriptive statistics, the Mann Whitney U test, and the Kruskal Wallis test were used in analyzing the data. Results: The mean age of the students participating in the study was 66.71±4.52, 63.7% were female, 62.3% were university graduates, 89.4% were retired, and 70.0% had a medium income.

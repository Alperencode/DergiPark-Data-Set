Makale Başlığı: Is Presenteeism Good or Bad? A Phenomenological Study in Schools
Özet: The study aims to holistic and comprehensive analyse presenteeism according to the perceptions of education workers who experience it more frequently and reveal the relationship of presenteeism with the sociological, psychological, and theological dynamics of Turkish society. The study was conducted with a phenomenological design, one of the qualitative research methods. The study group consists of teachers and school administrators working in Elazig, a province in Turkey. It was determined that educators can voluntarily decide to work when they are not feeling well due to motivations such as a sense of responsibility, conscience, commitment to work, public service, and religious sensitivity. In addition, some participants stated that due to organisational pressure, economic difficulties, and workload, employees make a forced decision to work when they are not well. Finally, in addition to the negative results of presenteeism, positive results, which are rarely seen in the literature, were also obtained. Therefore, the experience of presenteeism should be evaluated considering its positive and negative effects on organizations and employees.

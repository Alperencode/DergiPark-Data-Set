Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of Milan Kundera's Ignorance and Dubravka Ugrešić's Ministry of Pain in the Context of Trauma, Grief, and Nostalgia Processes Associated with Immigration
Özet: This study examines Milan Kundera's Ignorance and Dubravka Ugrešić's Ministry of Pain in the context of trauma and mourning experiences caused by the immigration experience. Through this perspective, the relationship of migration with various psychological processes, especially trauma and mourning; then the place of migration, trauma, and mourning in fictional narratives were emphasized. In this context, the effect of migration on the psychological states of the characters in the works that are the subject of the study has been examined by using psychoanalytic theory within the framework of the perspective of Sigmund Freud's “task-based” mourning theory to the concepts of mourning and trauma. It has been concluded that the experiences of the novel characters in the fictional theme coincide with the concepts suggested by the trauma and mourning theories on migration. In addition, it is thought that the psycho-social situations before the migration shape the relationship of migration with trauma and mourning processes.

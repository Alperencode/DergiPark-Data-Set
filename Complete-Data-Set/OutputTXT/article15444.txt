Özet: On the sixtieth anniversary of the labor migration from Turkey to Germany, social scientistsmust contemplate the position of the descendants of the guest-workers in contemporaryGerman society as an exclusive social phenomenon. Germany has consideredlabor migrants to be temporary residents for a long time, therefore, avoiding enactingthe legal framework to recognize their substantive membership rights in the polity. Untilthe amendments at the beginning of the 21st century, formal citizenship was largely inaccessiblefor labor migrants and their families due to the jus sanguinis (right of blood)principle. Historically, German citizenship was defined through an ethnic understandingof nationhood.

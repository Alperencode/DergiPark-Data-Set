Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Glocalization Strategies Implemented by Global Companies on Consumer Brand Preference in Türkiye: The Case of South Korea
Özet: The concept of glocalization, which is formed by combining the words globalization and localization, has been widely used in recent years. The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of glocal marketing strategies on consumers' brand preferences. In the study, South Korean brands operating in Türkiye were examined. In order to determine the effect of glocal marketing strategies implemented by South Korea-based companies on brand preference, the survey method was used as a data collection method in the research. According to the results obtained from the research, it was determined that the sub-dimensions of glocalization strategies such as distribution, price, promotion and sensitivity were effective on consumer preferences, while product and environment dimensions were not effective on consumer preferences.

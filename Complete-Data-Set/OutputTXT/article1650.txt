Makale Başlığı: Turkish Political Advertising: A Content Analysis of Newspaper Political Advertisements Between 1977 and 2007
Özet: Although newspaper political advertising dates back to the late 1970s in Turkey, the literature consisting of systematic studies based on empirical data is relatively small. This paper examines political advertising in newspapers during eight general elections between 1977 and 2007 in Turkey by using the qualitative content analysis method. This study aims to explore the main characteristics of newspaper political advertisements to contribute to a deeper understanding of Turkish political culture. The study covers a total of 434 political ads collected from the online archive of Milliyet to classify them according to the categories widely used in the literature. The results of this study indicate that Turkish newspaper political ads are 1-) positive; 2-) issue-oriented though there is an upward trend in the rate of images; 3-) not entirely evidence-based; 4-) generally concerned with the economy-related issues and mostly targeting the youth when it comes to a specific voter segment.

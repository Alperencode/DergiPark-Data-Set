Makale Başlığı: Compassion Scale Validity and Reliability Study
Özet: The aim of this study is to develop a valid and reliable scale that can be used to determine the level of reflecting the value of compassion on the attitudes and behaviors of primary school children. The sample of the research consists of 300 classroom teachers working in Şanlıurfa. The data were collected with the draft scale form prepared for the thesis study. Data were collected with a draft scale form containing 47 items. First, KMO and Bartlet test analyzes were performed on the obtained data set . Values were examined and construct validity and distinctiveness analysis were performed within the scope of validity analysis, and internal consistency analysis was performed within the scope of reliability analysis. After the analysis, a scale structure consisting of 28 items gathered under a single factor was reached. The scale was named the “Compassion Scale”. The KMO value of the scale was 0.966; Bartlett Test values are x2=5992,493 sd =46; p<0.001. The validity of the scale was examined by exploratory factor analysis and distinctiveness analysis. The factor loads of the scale items are between 0.597 and 0.754. The total amount of variance explained is 54,821%. The item-total correlation coefficients were positive and significant at the p<0.001 level. Within the scope of the reliability examination of the scale, the Cronbach Alpha coefficient was calculated within the scope of the internal consistency examination and was determined as 0.965. These obtained values were evaluated within the scope of the limit values expressed in the literature, and it was concluded that the Compassion Scale is a valid and reliable scale that can be used to determine the compassion levels of primary school students.

Makale Başlığı: Reincarnation in Terms of Faith in The Light of Verses
Özet: Reincarnation, also known as transmigration, is a form of thought and belief that goesback to ancient times. It is seen that this idea to have spread especially in and around theIndian peninsula, as it was in the ancient Greeks. In Islamic societies, it has been defendedby some marginalized groups and individuals. Apart from this, it is not accepted andrejected by the general of Islam. In this study, although the advocates of reincarnation tryto bring some of the verses as evidence, it is proved that this is not true, based on theseverses. In addition, in this study, it is emphasized that the belief in reincarnation, beliefin Allah, resurrection after death (the world of the hereafter), does not comply with thepersonality of man’s sins, the integrity of the soul and body, the creation of man and it isdefinitely not accepted and rejected in the Islamic faith.

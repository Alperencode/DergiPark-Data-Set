Makale Başlığı: An Analysis of the Vocabulary of the 8th Grade Turkish Textbook
Özet: The main carrier of educational processes is textbooks. While the curriculum elements in the textbooks provide academic and cultural com-petence, the texts used and the vocabulary of the texts provide competence in terms of communication skills, basic language skills, and expression skills of the target audience. In this research, which was carried out in a descriptive survey model by adopting a qualitative approach, the vocabulary of the reading texts in the 8th grade Turkish textbook approved by the Ministry of Education was examined with a software used in the field of corpus linguistics, and statistics-based data were obtained. When the data set of the research is examined, it is seen that the vocabulary of the textbook is qualified; It was determined that the use of different words was sufficient. In the second phase of the study, the frequency lists of the Turkish National Corpus and TS CORPUS corpus, which were structured on Turkish, were included in the process, based on the increasing number of corpus-based studies in recent years. The frequency lists obtained from both corpuscles were compared with the frequency lists obtained from the reading texts in the course material. As a result of this comparison based on the 1000 most frequently used words in Turkish, the number of common words in the vocabulary of the course material is 433 according to the Turkish National Corpus data; According to the TS Corpus Corpus data, it was determined as 395. It was seen that the level of partnership determined in terms of the 1000 most frequently used words in Turkish was sufficient. It was emphasized that the vocabulary of the course materials in terms of basic language skills, expression skills, and communication skills of the target audience should be conducted with corpus-based approaches rather than intuitive methods.

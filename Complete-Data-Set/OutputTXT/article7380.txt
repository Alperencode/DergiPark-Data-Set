Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS IN DRILLING OF AA 7075 T6 PLATE WITH DIFFERENT CUTTING TOOL GEOMETRIES WITH EXPERIMENTAL, STATISTICAL AND DEFORM 3D SIMULATION
Özet: The basis of the study is to examine the average surface roughness (Ra) value resulting from drilling AA 7075 T6 plates with drills with different point angles () and under different cutting parameters. However, two different point angles (118° and 135°), three different cutting speeds (Vc) (40, 60 and 80 m/min) and three different feeds (f) (0.04, 0.08 and 0.12 mm/rev) were preferred in the experiments. The effect of cutting and tool geometry parameters on Ra was digitized by performing an ANOVA analysis. It was determined that Ra increased with the increase of Vc,  and f. The parameter with the most significant effect on Ra was Vc with 49.10%, followed by  with 30.52% and f with 13.67%, respectively. In order to examine the reasons for the increase in Ra value more effectively, drilling simulations were carried out under different cutting parameters using Deform 3D software. The simulation estimated temperature, cutting force and damage during drilling. The predicted results and the factors on Ra were revealed. In the experiments carried out with the drill with a tip angle of 135°, it was estimated that the temperature, the temperature, the cutting force and the damage value along the Z-axis were higher than the drill with a tip angle of 118°.

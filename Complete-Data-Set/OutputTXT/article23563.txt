Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Mothers’ Parental Acceptance-Rejection Levels and Their Emotion Regulation Skills
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between perceived parental acceptance-rejection levels and their emotion regulation skills in adult women who are mothers. 300 people participated in the study, and the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Scale and Emotion Regulation Difficulties Questionnaire were applied to the participants. In addition, socio-demographic information of the participants was obtained in order to evaluate the variables of age, gender, education level, marital status, income level, and parent income level. Statistical data analysis (SPSS 23.0) was used to analyze the research variables. According to the findings obtained in the study, it was found that there is a significant relationship between the levels of perceived acceptance rejection from parents and emotion regulation. Perceived rejection was significantly associated with emotion regulation difficulties; It was concluded that the perceived rejection from parents significantly predicted the difficulties of emotion regulation. Additionally, it was determined that the perceived parental rejection of the individuals at the undergraduate or graduate education level was lower than the individuals with primary or secondary education. The results show that individuals can develop emotion regulation skills depending on their perception of the type of communication they have with their parents.

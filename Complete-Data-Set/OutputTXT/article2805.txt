Makale Başlığı: Activities of Amphoteric Surfactants on Shampoo
Özet: In this study, the viscosity and foaming efficiency of amphoteric surfactants on shampoo were investigated and three most commonly used amphoteric surfactants were selected, i.e. Cocamidopropyl betaine (Dehyton KE), disodium coco ampho diacetate (Dehyton DC) and capryl/capramidopropyl betaine (Lirobet 810). Viscosity measurements of amphoteric surfactants were performed in the absence and presence of various concentrations of NaCl at different rates for the prepared shampoo base. The results found in these experiments were compared. It was observed that Cocamidopropyl Betaine amphoteric surfactant gained consistency by using less salt than the other two amphoteric surfactants studied. The best value in itself is the 7% (w/v) cocamidopropyl betaine amphoteric surfactant added to the shampoo base. The foam levels of amphoteric surfactants at different ratios added to the shampoo base studied were also investigated. It has been determined that the best foaming properties is cocamidopropyl betaine for all the amphoteric surfactant studied. The best value in itself is the 10% (w/v) use of cocamidopropyl betaine amphoteric surfactant added to the shampoo base. As a conclusion, cocamidopropyl betaine showed the best performance in terms of foams and thickens with the addition of a small amount of salt.

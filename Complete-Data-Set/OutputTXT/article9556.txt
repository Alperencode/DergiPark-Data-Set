Özet: Prof. Dr. Reşid Rahmeti Arat is the great Turkish scholar in the field of Old Turkic philology and engaged with a lot of the Old Uygur secular documents in the German-Turfan collection during his study at Berlin from 1928 to 1933. He made many photographic reproductions of the Uygur secular documents and transported the photographs with himself to Istanbul. Many original Uygur documents got lost during the World War II.

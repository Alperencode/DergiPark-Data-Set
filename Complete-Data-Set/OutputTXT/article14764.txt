Makale Başlığı: ‘A SOFT CRUSADE’ BY THE GERMAN EMPIRE: THE SECOND ORIENT JOURNEY OF WILHELM II (1898)
Özet: This study analyses the journey of Wilhelm II of the German Empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1898, during a very tense time in Europe. We see a policy of isolation for both the Ottoman Empire and the German Empire in the late 19th century because of their policies against European Powers. The Ottoman Empire lost the support of Britain and became an open target for the imperialist powers of the West. She also tried to protect her rights and power in the European policy against internal and external threats. The German Empire wanted to expand her influence and sphere of power to the East and threaten her rivals, especially France and Britain. This journey gave rise to a convergence policy for these empires. This journey consisted of two sections, İstanbul and Syria. In the İstanbul section, Wilhelm II met with Abdülhamid II and gained some privileges from the Ottoman Empire. In the Syria section, Kaiser Wihelm II applied the policy which we call “Soft Crusade” and fronted the Great Powers of Europe. Also, the aims and acquisitions of the two empires will be analysed in this study. This journey will be analysed with that perspective. This research aims to shed light on the acquisitions of the journey, and penetration of the German Empire, and German capital into the Ottoman Empire. Historical and political conditions during this journey show the emergence of twenty years of alliance between the Ottoman Empire and the German Empire.

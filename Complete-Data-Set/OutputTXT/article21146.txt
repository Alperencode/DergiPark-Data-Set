Makale Başlığı: Local Restaurants’ Effect on Tourist Experience: A Case from Istanbul
Özet: This  study  aims  to  employ  and  validate  experience  economy  theory  in   local   restaurant   settings   and   to   understand   the   dimensions   of   local  restaurant  experience  from  the  point  of  view  of  tourists.  A  self-administered   structured   questionnaire   based   on   the   investigation   of  previous  studies  was  used  to  collect  data  from  tourists  staying  in  Istanbul.  Data  were  analyzed  via  exploratory  factor  analysis  to  explore  different  dimensions  of  the  local  food  experience  of  tourists.  Contrary  to  the  experience  economy  model,  which  proposes  four  dimensions  of  experience,  this  research  has  identified  three  dimensions,  for  the  local  restaurant  experience,  namely  entertainment  and  esthetics,  education,  and  escapism.  Previous  research  applied  experience  economy  theory  in  literature,  but  this  research  is  the  first  to  employ  and  validate  the  dimensions  of  experience  for  a  local  restaurant  setting.  The  findings  of  the study will provide a new perspective to local restaurant managers as well as destinations to manage the experience of foreign travelers.

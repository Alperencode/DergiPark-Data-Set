Makale Başlığı: Understanding Cities’ Challenge with Neoliberalism: Political Economy of Urbanization and “Actually Existing Neoliberalism”
Özet: Studies on the criticism of space production in urban research have become a subject of more interest in recent years. The aim of this study is to discuss the political economy of urbanization, focusing on the ways in which critical urban theorists reread the city. Starting from the theory of “actually existing neoliberalism” developed by critical urban theorists such as Brenner and Theodore, institutional and spatial transformations in the urbanization process of neoliberalism were examined in this work. The first is the path-dependent character of neoliberal practices; the second is the creative and destructive moments of neoliberal policy and institutional changes; and the third is the transformation of cities into critical arenas for neoliberal interventions. To further contribute to the critical knowledge base of urban geography studies, the paper ends with a discussion of the study examples that investigate the city from a political economy perspective.

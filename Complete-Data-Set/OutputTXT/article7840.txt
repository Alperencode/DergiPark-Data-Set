Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Security and Terror Policies in Bill Clinton Era in the Perspective of Realist Constructivism on Turkey-USA Relations
Özet: The Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991, and George Bush declared that the United States of America (USA) was a superpower with the “New World Order”. Then, Bill Clinton from the Democratic Party was elected president. Clinton forged a roadmap in accordance with the requirements of the New World Order. Bush administration embraced realist parameters. Contrary to this approach, Clinton pursued idealist policies on security and terror. Clinton regarded it as a transition from “hard power” to “soft power” on the axis of international organizations, allies, and other states. In this context, since the Gulf War that started in August 1990, Turkey-USA relations have been maintained with the understanding of a “common ally”. They have progressed within the framework of “close cooperation” during the Clinton era. Turkey’s active role in the Iraq War and its siding with the USA within North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) brought the relations to a “strategic partnership” level, although some sections did not accept it. This study aims to evaluate the positions of Turkey and the USA during the presidency of Clinton through making foreign policy analysis in line with the realist constructivist analytical perspective.

Makale Başlığı: Teachers' Self-Efficacy and Importance Scale for Learning, Development Monitoring and  Evaluation Competencies
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the importance and self-efficacy of teachers' learning from teaching profession competencies, monitoring and evaluation of development; To develop measurement tools with high reliability and validity. For construct validity in data analysis; exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis; Convergent validity, which gives information about the relationship between the factor and the items under it, and Horn Parallel Analysis were used as additional evidence for the determination of the structure. In the reliability analysis, Cronbach alpha reliability determination method and composite reliability  were used. The single-factor significance scale, which explained 57.832% of the total variance, and the two-factor self-efficacy scale, which explained 65.1%, were obtained. It was concluded that the fit indices of the measurement models tested with CFA for both scales were within acceptable criteria.While the Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient for “significance scale” was 0.996; 0.968 for the self-efficacy scale and .951 for the "competences regarding the process of planning, developing and applying measurement tools" sub-dimension, .944 for the sub-dimension of "analyzing measurement results, reporting and re-arranging the process". While the composite reliability calculated for the significance scale was 0.966; The CR values obtained for the self-efficacy scale were found to be 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. Convergent validity conditions were met for both scales. These findings can be interpreted in a way that the measurements revealed by the developed scale are reliable.

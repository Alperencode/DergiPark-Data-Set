Makale Başlığı: Review of Tele Nursing Applications: A Systematic Review
Özet: Aim: The purpose of this systematic review is to review the existing studies evaluating the effectiveness of telenursing and to systematically examine the data obtained from the studies. Materials and Methods:  In this systematic review, articles in the "Google Scholar", "PubMed", "Google Scholar" and "Web of Science" databases between 2010-2021 were examined. In the review, articles with the keywords "tele nursing", "tele nursing practices", "tele nursing", "tele nursing practices", "nurse-led telephone follow-up" and "nurse-led telephone follow-up" and whose full text can be accessed were selected. A total of 12 studies meeting the criteria were reviewed from these articles. Results: In the studies included in the research, it has been determined that tele-nursing practices reduce anxiety, depression and stress levels, help patients rehabilitate, increase patient satisfaction and quality of life, support safe care, and help individuals increase their self-efficacy and knowledge about their diseases. Conclusion: As a result of this systematic review, it is thought that tele-nursing practices contribute positively to the disease management of patients and have an important place in nursing practices. However, studies conducted in our country show that the use of tele-nursing practices in care management is limited. For this reason, it is recommended to increase tele-nursing practices and research in this area.

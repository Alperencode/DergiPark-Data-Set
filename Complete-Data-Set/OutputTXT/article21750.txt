Makale Başlığı: Social Studies and Mind Maps
Özet: It is known that in the classrooms where the teacher is active and the students are passive, the efficiency obtained from the lessons is low and the gains are not achieved by the students at a sufficient level. One of the ways to activate students in the lessons is to enable them to make various visual materials in the classroom. Mind maps are one of the visual materials used in the lessons. Mind maps are effective materials in terms of both gaining different note-taking skills and better understanding of the subjects. Mind map making is important because it includes cognitive, affective and behavioral elements. Along with the teacher's presentation of mind map examples in the lessons, organizing activities for students to create mind maps can make the lesson more productive. From this point of view, mind mapping activities were carried out with social studies prospective teachers. The aim of this study is to present examples of mind maps that can be used in social studies course according to the gains. In the study, social studies prospective teachers created mind maps in line with the gains they chose. Thus, prospective teachers experienced the mind map creation process themselves.

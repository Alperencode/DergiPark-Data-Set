Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Foot and Ankle Pathologies and Accessory Bones with Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Özet: Objective: Examination of foot pathologies and accessory bones with foot and ankle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and determining the results.Material and Method: The results of the cases over the age of 18 who applied to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Orthopedics outpatient clinic between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015 and underwent MRI of the foot and ankle were evaluated retrospectively. 462 cases, 255 women, and 207 men were included in the study. All results were evaluated. Foot pathologies and accessory bones were evaluated from MR official reading reports.Results: A total of 462 cases were included in the study. 49.1% of the foot pathologies were detected on the right side and 50.9% on the left side. Accessory bones were determined as os trigonum (1.9%) and accessory navicular bone (0.4%). MRI findings were defined as; tibiotalar effusion (50%), (20.1%), intramedullary lesion (14.3%), flexor hallucis longus tendinitis (21%), anterior talofibular ligament injury (6.5%), posterior talofibular ligament injury (5.4%), osteomyelitis (0.4%), Morton's neuroma (13.6%), Achilles tendinitis (3.2%), cyst (12.1%), hallux valgus deformity (2.2%), avascular necrosis (1.7%), peroneal tendinitis (5%), extensor tendinitis (2.4%), recent fracture (2.2%), tibialis posterior tendinitis (6.1%), flexor digitorum longus tendonitis (5%), retrotalar bursitis (4.3%), coalition (0.2%), tumor (1.3%), tibiotalar tendinitis (5.4%).Conclusion: The frequency and distribution of foot pathologies and accessory bones were determined using MRI. In this study, the most common accessory bone was determined as os trigonum. In addition, according to the results of the study, the most common pathology was tibiotalar effusion. In this study, in contrast to previous studies, accessory bones were identified as a small group. MRI is useful for evaluating accessory bones and soft tissue lesions.

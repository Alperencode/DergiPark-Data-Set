Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Readability Levels of Nervous System Subject in 11th Grade Biology Textbooks
Özet: Textbooks organize the information in parallel with the curricula accepted by the country and present them to the students in a plan. However, the most important issue for textbooks is that these books are written for students who are a special audience. For this reason, the most important feature of the textbooks is that the content is understandable. For this reason, readability is of great importance in the selection of biology books and in different branches of science. In this study, it is aimed to calculate and compare the readability level of the texts on the "Nervous System" in two 11th grade Biology textbooks prepared according to the current curriculum that the MEB decided to teach in the 11th grades in 2021, according to two different formulas. For this purpose, the readability formula, which Ateşman (1997) adapted from Flesch to Turkish, and the Sonmez (2003) formula, which are among the readability formulas, were applied to the texts on the nervous system in two 11th grade biology textbooks. According to the findings, the readability levels of the formula, in which Ateşman translated the Flesh formula into Turkish, are difficult to medium. However, according to Sönmez formula, it is found that the sample texts are at an understandable level.

Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Simplified Mathematics Items with Student Performance and Item Comprehensibility
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between simplified mathematics items with student performance and item comprehensibility. The research was designed in a multiple case study model. The study group of the research consists of 38 students residing in different provinces, enrolled at different schools, and can be accessed online. The main data of the study were collected from 20 students aged 14 years. The data of the study were collected in two stages. In the first stage, think-aloud protocols (TAP) and semi-structured interviews were conducted with each of the 20 students aged 14 years online. At this stage, data were collected with the help of original and simplified mathematics achievement tests and a semi-structured interview form. In the second stage, the linguistic complexity level of the items in the original and simplified test forms was scored. A rubric was used for this process. In the analysis of the data, hypothesis tests, frequency distributions, and content analysis were used. Research findings indicate that the creation of mathematics items with common words and short sentences can contribute to comprehensibility for students with the behavior measured by the item. The findings of the study indicate that this contribution may be higher in students with language skills deficiency.

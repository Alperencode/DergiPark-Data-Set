Makale Başlığı: WORKIN' MOMS AND THE LETDOWN: ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF REPRESENTATION OF MOTHERHOOD ON NETFLIX
Özet: In this study, motherhood-themed TV series Workin' Moms and The Letdown, one Canadian and one Australian production, broadcast on Netflix, today's largest digital broadcasting platform, are examined in the context of the representation possibilities of today's changing motherhood. In the study in which the qualitative methodological perspective is adopted, the first season of Workin' Moms (13 episodes) and the two seasons of The Letdown series (13 episodes in total) were analyzed with thematic analysis method. The analysis was carried out under three themes by making use of the general narrative pattern of the TV series: Motherhood as a Bodily and Social Transformation, Motherhood as an Interruption/Disconnection in Women's Lives, and Motherhood as a Social Struggle. A self-reflexive perspective is also included in the analysis. It has been argued that the fact that digital broadcasting platforms include content compatible with the demands of social movements problematizes popular discourses about motherhood in different ways. It has been stated that the two series examined offer a representation opportunity that includes the objections of the women's movement against popular discourses that glorify/sanctify motherhood on the one hand and oppress women on the other  hand and cover different forms of motherhood.

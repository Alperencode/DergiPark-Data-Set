Makale Başlığı: Weber’s Concepts of West and East on the Basis of Logos-Centrism
Özet: Because its intellectual structure depends on logos, Eurocentrism accepts that the West and East have different historical processes and that the West is superior to the East. Logos, on which Western metaphysics and idealism is based, accepts anything irrational outside of the universal-rational framework. The dualism established by logos-centrism underlies the epistemological acceptance that the West and East represent an opposition. Dualism presents the contrasts needed in the understanding of unity in Western philosophy. The distinction between West and East is made and maintained within this intellectual framework. The superiority of reason over emotions is reflected in the opposition of West and East, and this dualist structure constitutes the discourse about the unique position of Western civilization against other civilizations. Within the context of this article, the logos-centric approach, which is the determinant of Western philosophy, will be evaluated through the distinction between West and East in Weber's sociology. For this purpose, Eurocentrism and the logos that form the basis of the approach will be included, and the position of the logos in Western philosophy will be mentioned in line with Derrida's thoughts. Finally, the reflections of logos in the works of Weber, who we claim to have a Eurocentric philosophy, will be discussed through the concepts of administration, capitalism, religion and urbanization through the concepts of West and East.

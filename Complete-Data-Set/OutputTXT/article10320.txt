Makale Başlığı: Investigation Of The Effects Of Tinkercad Based Stem Implementations On Computational (Computer) Thinking Skills And Technology Use Standards Of Teacher Candidates
Özet: Purpose: This study investigates the effect of STEM implementations on computational thinking skills and technology usage standards of classroom teacher candidates. The experimental method “One-group Pretest-Posttest Design” has been used in the study. In line with the purpose of the study, data on Computer Thinking Skills and Technology Use Standards of pre-service teachers who participated in STEM education practices for 11 weeks were collected and analyzed at the beginning and end of the procedure.Design/Methodology/Approach: The experimental method “One-group Pretest-Posttest Design” has been used in the study. Ninety pre-service teachers who took Science and Technology Laboratory Practices I and II courses from Kastamonu University Faculty of Education and the primary school teaching department participated in the study.Findings: According to the results of the study, while it was seen that the candidates for STEM implementations were not generally effective in their classrooms, their preferences in one of the nearby backgrounds from one of the sub-dimensions considered only by the computer.

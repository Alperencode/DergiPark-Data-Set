Makale Başlığı: Active Face Spoof Detection Using Image Distortion Analysis
Özet: With the rising use of facial recognition systems in a range of real-world scenarios and applications, attackers are also increasing their efforts, with a number of spoofing techniques emerging. As a result, developing a reliable spoof detection mechanism is critical. Active-based techniques have been shown to be good at finding spoofs, but they have a number of problems, such as being intrusive, expensive, hard to compute, not being able to be used in many situations, and usually needing extra hardware. This research presented an active-based robust spoof detection technique capable of detecting a wide range of media or 2D attacks while being less intrusive, less expensive, low in complexity, and more generalizable than other active-based techniques. It doesn't require any additional hardware, so it can easily be integrated into current systems. The distortion variations of video frames of the user's face collected at varying distances from the camera are analyzed to detect spoofing. Both the legitimate and spoof attack datasets were created using real-world facial photo and video data. The proposed approach achieved a spoof detection accuracy of 98.18% using both machine learning classifiers and a deep learning model, with an equal error rate and a half total error rate as low as 0.023 and 0.021, respectively.

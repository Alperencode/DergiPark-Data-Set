Makale Başlığı: Opinions of social studies teachers on environmental literacy skills
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the views of social studies teachers about environmental literacy skills. In the study, the basic qualitative research design, one of the qualitative research methods, was used. The research participants were determined by purposive sampling method and consisted of 9 social studies teachers working in the 2021-2022 academic year in Şanlırfa. Research data were analyzed by content analysis. According to the results obtained, it has been observed that teacher-centered teaching is generally used in lessons in order to bring environmental literacy skills, as well as student-centered lesson activities are applied by some teachers. It has been concluded that the teachers' awareness of the scope of environmental literacy skills is high, but they have difficulties in bringing skills due to the lack of class hours, the crowded curriculum and the inability to perform out-of-school activities. Out-of-school learning environments should be used.

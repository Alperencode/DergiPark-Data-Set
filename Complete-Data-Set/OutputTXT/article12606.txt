Makale Başlığı: Determination of Environmental Stressors Perceived by Patients Hospitalized in the Coronary Intensive Care Unit
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the environmental stressors perceived by patients hospitalized in the coronary intensive care unit.Methods: This descriptive study was conducted on 315 patients hospitalized in the coronary intensive care unit of a hospital between 01.08.2019 and 01.12.2019. Patient Identification Form and Intensive Care Unit Environmental Stressor Scale (ICUESS) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 22,0 program. Results were interpreted at a significance level of p<0.05.Results: The mean ICUESS score of patients was 56.33 ± 12.09. Female patients, secondary school graduates, married patients and those previously treated in the intensive care unit were significantly more affected by the stressors in the intensive care unit (p<0.05). Patients with peripheral artery disease had lower scores than patients with myocardial infarction and arrhythmia, and those with coronary artery disease had lower scores than patients with arrhythmia (p<0.05).Conclusion: Patients in the coronary intensive care unit were affected by environmental stressors in the intensive care unit at certain levels. Some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients had affected the patients’s perceptions. It is recommended to control environmental stressors with measures to be taken in the light of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients, and to apply an individualized care approach instead of applying standard care plans in this process.

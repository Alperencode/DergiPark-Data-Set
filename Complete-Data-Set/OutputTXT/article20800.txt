Makale Başlığı: Prognostic significance of body mass index and diabetes in patients with malignant glioma
Özet: Aim: We aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between body mass index (BMI) and diabetes (DM) before treatment and survival with this study.Material and Methods: The results of patients who received radiotherapy between 2010 - 2018 were evaluated with this retrospective study. BMI was categorized into 3 groups: normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2), obese (≥30 kg/m2). Presence of diabetes was evaluated by considering oral antidiabetic use and file information before treatment. Patient, treatment and tumor characteristics were evaluated with descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meirer, log-rank and cox-regression analyzes were performed. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: The results of 174 cases were evaluated. Diabetes was present in 22 patients (12.6%). In univariate analyzes, being over the age of 65 (p <0.001), Karnofsky performance score (KPS) below 80 (p <0.001), diabetes (p = 0.017), having grad 4 pathology (p <0.001), performing subtotal excision / biopsy (p <0.001), hypofractioned / whole brain radiotherapy (p <0.001), and not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) (p <0.001) had a negative effect on overall survival (OS). In multivariate analyzes, being over 65 years old, having grad 4 pathology, performing subtotal excision / biopsy and not taking adjuvant CT were found to be effective on OS. Median overall survival in diabetics was 9.65 months and 17.74 months in non-diabetics (p = 0.017). No statistically significant relationship was found between BMI and OS.Conclusion: Pre-existing diabetes in malignant glioma patients is a risk factor for poor outcomes. It is important to control diabetes and related conditions.

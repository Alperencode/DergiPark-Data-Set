Makale Başlığı: Tensile and Morphological Properties of Waste Tire Rubber Granule/Polyester Polymer Matrix Composite
Özet: In this study, waste tire rubber granules were used as filler material for the fabrication of polymer matrix composite samples. The polyester resin which is one of the most preferred matrix materials and recycled waste tire rubber granules were combined at varying ratios with the open molding method. The samples were characterized experimentally by conducting tensile and hardness tests. The morphological properties of the specimens were examined with scanning electron microscope images. The study revealed that the addition of untreated waste tire rubber granules to polyester resin decreases the tensile and yield strength values, while it causes to increase in elongation and ductility of the material. The morphological examinations showed that waste rubber granules and polyester resin have poor interfacial adhesion and thus the waste rubber granules should be properly treated to be used as filler material. The study indicated that waste tire rubber granule/polyester composites can be used for non-structural applications with the benefits of using less fossil sourced raw materials and contributing to the decrement of environmental pollution.

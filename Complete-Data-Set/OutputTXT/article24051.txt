Makale Başlığı: The Influence of Environmental Factors on Sudanese Desert Goat Kids' Birth Weight, Weaning and Mortality in the Province of North Kordofán, Sudan
Özet: The recent experience was aimed to evaluate the effect season on birth, parity and growth performance on of Sudanese desert goat kids' in Northern Kordofán province Sudan. Thirty seven (37) kids of desert goats which were divided in (2) flocks according to the birth season (rainy and dry seasons). Kids were subjected to natural grazing. The results indicated that the season of kidding and parity number seemed to had no significant influence on kids' birth weight, growth performance and kids born during autumn time secured highest birth weight (2.12±0.08 kg) compared with kids born during the dry time (2.07±0.11 kg). The results showed that the birth type girth significant (P<0.05) effect on kids' birth weight; single born kids were heavier at birth (2.31±0.10) than twin born kids (1.96±0.12 kg). The gender of kids has highly significant (P≤0.01) influence on birth weight; male kids' were heavier than the female kids'. Type of birth and gender of kids' were not statistically significant affect growth performance of desert kids to weaning period, where Twin and female kids showed lightest body weight growth (4.06, 6.52 and 9.01kg and 3.96, 6.37 and 8.53 kg) respectively for twin and female kid. The findings stated that time of birth; parity number & birth type were not affected weaning weight and daily gain at 90 days of age. Gender of kids' was exerted significant (P<0.05) effected weaning weight, where male kids recorded (9.19 kg) compared to their counterparty female (8.53 kg). The two seasons of birth (rainy & cool, dry season), parity order did no exerted any significant effect on the pre weaning mortality. Twin born kids showed a high rate (P<0.05) of morality with 22% as compared with kids' born as single (5%). Also gender of kids significantly (P<0.05) effects mortality rate, where female had higher rate 18% as compared with male 9%. In conclusion, season of birth was the supreme important exporter of the variation in this treatment. As a result, in this study, the most important source of variation was the birth season and it was determined that environmental factors had a positive effect on live weight and growth rates in goats.

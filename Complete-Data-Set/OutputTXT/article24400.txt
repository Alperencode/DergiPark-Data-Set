Makale Başlığı: Medico-Legal Evaluation of Geriatric Patients and Mortality Predictors in the Elderly with Forensic Trauma
Özet: Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate demographic and epidemiological aspects of older people with forensic events and to determine factors affecting in-hospital mortality in geriatric patients with forensic trauma.Materials and Methods: All patients aged ≥65 years who were admitted to the emergency department between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018 and reported as a forensic case were included in the study. The demographic data, vital and clinical findings, forensic diagnoses and in-hospital mortality statuses of the patients were recorded. ‘Glasgow Coma Scale’ for all patients and ‘Injury Severity Score’ for patients with forensic trauma were calculated. Characteristics of patients with in-hospital mortality and surviving patients were compared. Also, a multivariate logistic regression analyses was used to assess the predictors for in-hospital mortality in patients with forensic trauma.Results: A total of 598 geriatric forensic patients were included in the analyses. The most frequent forensic admission reason was motor vehicle collisions (n=317, 53.01%). 3.17% (n=19) of the patients died. The multivariate logistic regression model was formed with age, gender, Injury Severity Score, presence of multitrauma, falling from height and ground level falls. Falling from height was found to be the most distinctive predictor for in-hospital mortality [odds ratio: 54.628], and as age increased, mortality increased as well.Conclusion: The most frequent forensic event in the older people was motor vehicle collisions. In forensic admissions, the trauma mechanism of falling from height clearly increases in-hospital mortality among the geriatric population.

Makale Başlığı: The Combining Constructed Wetland and Ultrafiltration to Increase Total Coliform Removal Efficiency of Wastewater
Özet: The horizontal sub-surface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW) is a green and sustainable technology that imitates natural wetlands for wastewater treatment purposes, efficient in removing pollutants from various types of wastewater. Hospitals in Palu, Indonesia, are facing problems due to the poor performance of existing WWTPs, especially in removing total coliform (TC) and total suspended solids (TSS). This issue needs attention because it can impact health and the environment. Efforts to use HSSF-CW for hospital wastewater treatment are expected to overcome these problems. The HSSF-CW usually produces an effluent low in organic matter and TSS but not for TC, so this system still needs to be combined with other systems. Combining HSSF-CW with ultrafiltration membranes (UF) is an exciting idea. The UF membranes with pores between 0.01 – 0.1 µm are expected can hold bacteria. This study aims to design the HSSF-CW and UF membrane combination system on a pilot-scale that considers aesthetic factors, then evaluates its performance using experimental methods. In this case, ware utilized ornamental water plants (Ludwigia adscendens, Echinodorus paniculatus, and Typha angustifolia) and gravel sand media measuring 5 – 8 mm. The results proved effective in removing TC and TSS parameters with 98.64% and 100% efficiency. Thus, the HSSF-CW and UF membrane combination system was suitable for hospital wastewater treatment in Palu, Indonesia.

Makale Başlığı: Scutellaria columnae All. (Lamiaceae), a new record for the flora of Turkey
Özet: Plant specimens belonging to the Scutellaria genus of the Lamiaceae family were collected from Zonguldak (Ereğli), Bolu (Gölcük), Bartın (Ulus-Uluyayla), Kastamonu (Azdavay-Cide) and Sinop (Ayancık) provinces in the north of Turkey between 2018-2021. The collected plant samples were dried in accordance with herbarium techniques. After detailed herbarium studies and literature reviews, it was determined that this species does not take place in the flora of Turkey, and it is Scutellaria columnae All. With this new record added to the Scutellaria genus in our country, the number of taxa belonging to this genus in Turkey has increased to 41. In this study, there are descriptions, detailed photographs, and distribution areas of Scutellaria columnae, as a new species record for Turkey. With new studies to be carried out in different regions, it is thought that new endemic, natural and invasive species records will be added to the floristic richness of our country, which has not been fully revealed yet.

Makale Başlığı: Linked Open Tafsīr Conference
Özet: An international symposium under the leadership of the Goethe University Islamic Science and Society Academy [Goethe Universität Akademie für Islam in Wissenschaft und Gesellschaft] was held in Bad Homburg, Germany, between 18-20 July 2022, with the participation of researchers from the different universities and research centers around the world. It is possible to divide the content of the symposium into two as scientific project presentations and subject descriptions; however, it should be said that both the projects and the subjects are aimed at understanding the early period of Islam. The title of the symposium, which was held on the occasion of the completion of the first phase of the Linked Open Tafsīr project database, which has currently been carried out by Goethe University, was determined as Reconstructing the Dynamics of the Emergence of Islam.  This paper introduces the the subjects and the projects of the symposium.

Makale Başlığı: Development of School Adjustment Scale
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to develop a scale for multi-dimensional evaluation in determining the adjustment of middle and high school students to school. The trial form of the developed scale was administered to two separate study groups consisting of 684 middle and high school students studying between six and 12th grade levels in eight different schools in Ankara. In the exploratory factor analysis conducted to the first study group data an eight-factor and 66-item application form was developed. As a result of the confirmatory factor analysis conducted with the second study group sufficient values were obtained in terms of fit indices other than two. Acceptable reliability values were achieved for the whole scale and its dimensions. With the developed scale, it will be possible to examine the school adjustment levels of middle and high school students with various dimensions.

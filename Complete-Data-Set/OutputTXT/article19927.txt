Makale Başlığı: Ganglion cell complex analysis in thalassemia major patients measured by optical coherence tomography
Özet: To analyze the changes in ganglion cell complex (GCC), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and central macular thickness (CMT) on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with thalassemia major. Forty one eyes of 41 patients with thalassemia major and 41 eyes of 41 healthy subjects were included in this prospective and comparative study. Peripapillary RNFL thickness, CMT and macular GCC thickness were evaluated with OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT 5000Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA, USA) in all patients and healthy controls. Additionally, disease duration, serum ferritin level, hemoglobin concentration, the dosage and duration of chelation therapy, count of transfusion,  patient’s weight were analyzed in thalassemia major group. RNFL thickness values were lower in the thalassemia patients but the difference was not statistically significant (except superior quadrant) and there was no significant differences in the mean CMT measurements. GCC thickness was thinner in all areas ( average, superior, inferior, superior-temporal, inferior-temporal, superior-nasal, inferior-nasal) but only the thinning in the inferior-temporal was statistically significant. GCC and RNFL thickness changes occur earlier than CMT changes in β-thalassemia major patients. GCC thickness measurements can be used for follow-up in combination with other diagnostic methods.

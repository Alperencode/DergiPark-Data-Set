Makale Başlığı: Compound Verbs in The Structure of Noun+Auxiliary Verbs in Târîh-i Reşîdî Tercümesi - Defter-i Evvel Written in Post-Classical Period Chagatay Turkish
Özet: The last period of Chagatay Turkish from the beginning of the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century and mentioned as "Post-Classical Period (1600-1921)" in Eckmann's classification, it is also the last period before modern Turkic dialects in Turkestan and Idil-Ural regions. In the works of this period, there is variety in the compound verbs in the formation of noun + auxiliary verb. When these works are examined; apart from the auxiliary verbs et-, eyle-, kil-, bol-/ol-, which have been seen in Turkish since historical times, it has been observed that there are auxiliary verbs such as körset-, tap-, which have the functions of these verbs and are used differently from their own meanings. The noun elements added to these verbs are mostly Arabic and Persian origin words and even phrases. These findings were selected from the examples in Târîh-i Reşîdî Translation - Defter-i Evvel, one of the works belonging to the period. The examples in the work mentioned in the study will be compared with other works in the same centuries to reveal the variety of compound verbs in the Post-Classical Period of Chagatay Turkish. The stated examples and usages are indicative of the richness of the compound verbs in the Chagatay Turkish period. It can be recommended to show these examples as lexical entry word in the dictionary studies where the vocabulary of this period is included.

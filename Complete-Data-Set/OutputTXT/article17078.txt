Makale Başlığı: Akkoyunlu turcoman poet Afsahaddin Hidayet's poems in respect of classical traditions of turkic literatures
Özet: The Azerbaijani literature, enriched with new literary title and facts, gained new pages in respect of Comparative Literary relations of the poets of the XV century. Afsahaddin Hidayat, who lived in the Aghgoyunlu period and saw the reigns of state Uzun Hasan, Sultan Khalil and Sultan Yagub, stands before us in medieval sources as a commander who was the participant in historical events and as well as a poet who represents our national literary heritage with his Turkish Diwan. Being a worthy representative of his state, Afsahaddin Hidayat mastered the literary environment of his period and became deeply acquainted with poetry and art, differed from his contemporaries by his innate talent and folk style. Unfortunately, only the Turkish Divan has survived from Hidayet's works. Generally, there is limited information about the life and works of the poet in medieval sources. For the first time, Hidayat as a warrior- poet in the Azerbaijani Turkish literature was introduced by Prof. Dr. Azizaga Mammadov, but the first systematic scientific studies, manuscript text studies were carried out by us and his Divan was published. There are literary traces of masters such as Ahmad Yesavi, Yunus Emre, Mevlana Rumi, Nizami Ganjavi, Nasimi, Khatai, Navai in Hidayat's poems. In Fuzuli's art, there is a tidings of the most delicate, poetic verses of Hidayat. Our article examines the poet's skill of using Turkish literature before him and his literary effects on our literature after him from the point of view of khalafism and salafism.

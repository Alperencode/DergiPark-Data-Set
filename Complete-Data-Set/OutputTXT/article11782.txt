Makale Başlığı: Two Examples of Industrial Heritage: Gaziantep Kürkçü and Elbeyli Soap Factories
Özet: Gaziantep is a convenient olive region due to its geographical location. In this context, soap factories were built in the city because one of the raw materials of soap is olive oil. Kürkçü and Elbeyli Soap Factories are two of the structures that have survived to the present day. There have been khans known by the same names next to the soap factories. While these khans were evaluated in various studies, it has been determined that the soap factories were ignored. However, the Kürkçü and Elbeyli Soap Factories, together with their khans, are an important industrial heritage that contributed greatly to the local economy of Gaziantep in the late 19th century. As a result, in this study, these soap factories have been discussed in detail for the first time with their architecture, space functions, facade features, and history. It has been introduced by comparing other soap factories in the region with similar examples outside Turkey.

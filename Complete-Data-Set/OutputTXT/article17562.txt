Makale Başlığı: A CONSIDERATION ON THE LIMITEDNESS OF THE RIGHT TO HOLD MEETINGS AND DEMONSTRATION MARCHES
Özet: In the doctrine of constitutional law, the concepts of “limitedness” and the “restrictions” of rights and freedoms have different meanings. In the case of “restriction”, the area guaranteed by right and freedom is interfered from outside and this area is narrowed; “limitedness” come from rights and freedoms themselves. In this study, firstly, the views explaining the concept of “limitedness” of rights and freedoms will be examined. After this examination, the issue of “limitedness” of the right to hold meetings and demonstration marches will be discussed. In this context, what is meant by the issue that the meeting and demonstration march should be “peaceful” and “unarmed” will be analysed in the light of the views in the doctrine and judicial decisions.

Makale Başlığı: Velicorus Chauvinism and Azerbaijan in the 50s of the XX Century
Özet: In the period after World War II, the ideology of equality of nations was gradually thrown into background. A new wave of Velikorus chauvinism began in the early 1950s. Since one of the factors impacting social and political life in the early 1950s was that campaign to deny national identity proceeded to a new stage after giving the name “Azerbaijani’’ by changing the real name of Azerbaijani people (Turk) in the late 1930s still. The Soviet government tried to separate the Azerbaijani people from their ethnic roots by changing their names. As a result, national intellectuals, who were the bearers of the idea of national and social opinion, were subjected to both physical and mental pressure. The aim was to strengthen the psychology of slavery on the nations and peoples of the Soviet empire and   to believe in a bright future and in the foundations of communism with the help of the "brotherly" Russian people. However, despite all the pressure and oppression, the Azerbaijani Turkic nation was still able to preserve its traditions and national language, which plays an important role in the formation of the nation. In response to the national colonial oppression of the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani Turks managed to preserve their national and moral values.

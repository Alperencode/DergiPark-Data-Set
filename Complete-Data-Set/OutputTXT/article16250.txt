Makale Başlığı: PRIVATE SECURITY EDUCATION (COMPARISON OF TURKEY AND NORTH CYPRUS TURKISH REPUBLIC)
Özet: The private security sector has gained a great momentum in recent years, which leads to competition among institutions providing private security training. This competition can sometimes lead to debate about whether companies can provide efficient and sufficient training in private security training institutions with an operating license in order to maintain their existence in the long term, to provide sustainable competitive advantage and an average profit return. Within the scope of the law, private security education is available both in private security education institutions and in associate degree programs of universities. As a result of the trainings given in private security training institutions, Private Security Officers (PSO) have been trained in Vocational Schools of Universities (VSoU) and training activities are carried out in Private Security and Protection Programs. The purpose of the study is to reveal the profile of private security education in Turkey and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Thus, the study will be grounded on a basis especially by comparing private security training differences. The different MODULE programs are applied to PSOs who will work in specific fields in TRNC private security training. In this context, in order to improve private security education in Turkey, this program can be included in the course content of Private Security and Protection Programs within the vocational schools by making use of the MODULE based program.

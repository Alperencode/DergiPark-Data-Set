Makale Başlığı: Investigating the Migrant Smuggling in Turkey within the Scope of Legal and Economic Aspects
Özet: Immigrant Smuggling Crime is the de facto act of an individual's agreement with other persons or organizations who specialize in the field of illegal migrant logistics in return for a fee to go illegally from the country of residence to another country with better opportunities in various respects. That crime was not defined in Turkish Laws until 2002. Many social, economic, political, and psychological factors lead individuals to commit this crime. Therefore, immigrant smuggling is a global problem that states need to take measures at since it can cause many consequences to the detriment of the people who are the subject of smuggling and the countries through which the smugglers pass. In this research, migrant smuggling cases in Turkey between 2016 and 2019 are analyzed from legal and economic perspectives using secondary data.

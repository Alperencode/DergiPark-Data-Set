Makale Başlığı: DIGITAL AGE EFFECT AND ITS PSYCHOLOGICAL REFLECTIONS ON RELATION BETWEEN DESIGN-VISUAL PERCEPTION
Özet: New tools and systems produced by technology have added new concepts to interior architecture terminology. These concepts include virtual space as an environment, cyberspace, metaverse, and interactive spaces. Although interactive spaces are a new field, they are increasingly integrated into social life. These spaces, which offer new possibilities for communication between the shell surface and the user, also change the visual perception of the space. The study aims to evaluate the effects of technological developments on spaces based on visual perception and psychological impact and investigate the digital age effect on the design-visual perception-psychology relationship. For this purpose, the visual content analysis method was used in the study. The study was carried out within the scope of installations, where examples of interactive space productions are frequently seen and described as spatialized art. The patterns created by the examples in the context of visual design principles have been determined. As a result of the study, it was determined that the boundaries of solid physical space became unclear, and technological developments reinterpreted the relation between the individual and the space. It has been found that the visual perception of space and the psychology of space have changed because of this situation, and new dimensions have been added to the space experience.

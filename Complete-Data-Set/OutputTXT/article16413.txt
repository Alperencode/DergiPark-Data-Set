Makale Başlığı: DEVELOPMENT OF AN UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLE FOR OFF-ROAD APPLICATIONS
Özet: With the development of science and technology, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have become important with the development of hyper-high-precision sensors and robust, high-potential control systems. In addition, the unmanned ground vehicle has applications in various fields. For civilian use, such vehicles make it possible to avoid major losses by eliminating accidents caused by complex road situations and driver inattention. In addition, the use of UGVs potentially contributes to preventing endangerment of soldiers in military applications. In this study, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with a compact chassis and four-wheel drive was developed for low speed (<1 m/s) applications. The prototype produced has a carrying capacity of 5 kg and can be controlled remotely with the help of a transmitter. The vehicle design was examined by FEM (Finite Element Method) methods and its structural strength was found to be suitable. In the field tests, the actual performance of the prototype was examined and its structural strength was verified. The prototype that has been uncovered can reach a maximum speed of 6 km/h in a straight line, can be active for 28 minutes with full load capacity and can turn with a zero degree turning radius.

In this study, a case with weight regain after bariatric surgery was evaluated. In this case, the individual was evaluated every week according to the four adaptation areas of the Roy Adaptation Model. Nursing interventions for the adaptation areas of the Roy Adaptation Model were applied to the individual, and their adaptation to the changing lifestyle was supported by providing training for 9 weeks, once a week for an average of 1 hour, in line with their needs. Nursing diagnoses of over-nutrition in the area of physiologic mode, low self-esteem in self-concept mode, ineffective role performance in role function mode, deterioration in social communication in interdependence mode were discussed and nursing interventions were applied for these diagnoses.

According to the results of the study, with the nursing process planned and applied for this case, the individual's optimum adaptation to the changing lifestyle after bariatric surgery was restored.

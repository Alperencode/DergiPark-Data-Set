Makale Başlığı: An evaluation on migration and children's rights
Özet: Migration is a sociological movement. Children constitute an important part of migrant people and groups. Therefore, the issue of children and children's rights cannot be ignored when considering the concept of migration. The fact that children are in need of protection makes their rights even more important. The issue of children's rights is an issue that is very important today and is also guaranteed by laws. The issue of children's rights, which has been neglected and almost no legal regulation has been made throughout the ages, has started to be a matter of interest and concern only since the beginning of the 20th century in the historical process. This study covers immigration and children's rights; It is a compilation study in which the right to survive, the right to development, the right to protection and the right to participate are discussed. First of all, a large literature review was conducted on the sources dealing with the connection between migration and children's rights. National and international studies on the reflections of the increasing migration on children for various reasons, the problems experienced by the children who migrated, and the solution proposals have been examined. In the examination, an evaluation was made by considering immigration and children's rights within the framework of the findings obtained from the studies. Giving migrant children their rights will provide a solution to many problems that may occur after migration. Particularly, the importance given to children's rights by countries will bring along a better future for migrant children.

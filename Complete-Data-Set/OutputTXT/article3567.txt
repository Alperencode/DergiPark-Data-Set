Makale Başlığı: Effect of Resveratrol on Total Oxidative-Antioxidative Status and DNA Damage in Rats Induced Methotrexate
Özet: In this study, the effects of resveratrol (RES) on leukocyte percentages, total oxidant (TOS) -antioxidan status (TAS) and DNA damage (8-OHDG) were investigated in rats induced by methotrexate (MTX). The rats used in the study were randomly divided into 4 groups each consisting of 10 rats.Control group , MTX group (20 mg / kg ip, once a week, for two weeks) ,RES group (40 mg / kg / day orally, for two weeks), MTX + RES group (20 mg / kg ip, once a week and 40 mg / kg / day orally for 2 weeks)At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken from the hearts of the rats and the percentage of leukocyte (neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte, monocyte) was examined by classical methods. The levels of TOS and TAS were measured by colorimetric kits and 8-OHDG level by ELISA kit. Neutrophil (p≤0.05) and monocyte (p≤0.01) percentages of MTX and MTX + RES groups were found to be statistically lower than control and RES groups. There was also a significant increase in TOS and OSI levels (p <0.001) and a significant decrease in TAS level (p <0.05) in the MTX group. In the MTX + RES group, the positive statistical significance of these parameters was determined. Changes in eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte percentages were statistically insignificant. In conclusion, it can be said  that  the RES treatment  for neutropenia and monocytopenia caused by MTX can not be effective but may be effective in reducing oxidative stress.

Makale Başlığı: Conflict Resolution and Neoclassical Realism: An Analysis of the Annexation of Crimea and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict
Özet: In 2014, Crimea was annexed and joined Russia's territory, despite international law. However, the problems between Ukraine and Russia could not be resolved. This article argues that in order to understand the ongoing tension between these two countries today, the annexation of Crimea should be analysed in detail. Because the annexation symbolises a turning point of the conflict in Ukraine. Therefore, the purposes of writing this article are to explain Russia’s decision to annex Crimea with neoclassical realist theory, to analyse the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and to offer potential suggestions for conflict resolution. The article also aims to link neoclassical realism with conflict resolution studies. From this point of view, this study aims to answer three main research questions: Is it possible to articulate the neoclassical realist approach and conflict resolution as opposed to traditional realist approaches? If possible, to what extent and how can they contribute to each other? Which factors or variables were effective in Russia's decision to annex Crimea? The article argues that both internal and external variables from all three levels of analysis were effective in Russia's decision to annex Crimea, and therefore, neoclassical realist theory is more explanatory in analysing the annexation decision. The article also argues that neoclassical realism and conflict resolution literature can make a complementary contribution to each other.

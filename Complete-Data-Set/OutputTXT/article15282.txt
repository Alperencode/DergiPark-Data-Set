Makale Başlığı: Gamewood: Digital Games as a New Propaganda Medium
Özet: Digital games can be used for commercial purposes in the entertainment industry, as well as for sharing ideological messages, as they provide access to large audiences. Especially single-player war games, which are scenario modes, are used to propagate the ideologies of the game producers and the country where the production takes place. In this study, in which it is accepted that these games are not only simple leisure entertainment, but also a means of propaganda,it is aimed to reveal the accuracy of the said acceptance. For this reason, the Call of Duty Modern Warfare game, which was criticized for being openly propaganda, was analyzed with Espen Aartseth's holistic analysis model of digital games and content analysis method. As a result of the analysis, it has been seen that as in the previous games of the series, East-West, Russia-US conflicts are established, the people of the Middle East and Muslims are presented in a marginalizing way; Unlike the previous games of series, important roles are attributed to Middle Easterners and female characters. In addition, it has been observed that game publishers, other players, the current climate of ideas and virtual game characters are effective in the perception and prevalence of the messages given in the digital game.

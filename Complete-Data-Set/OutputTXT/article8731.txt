Makale Başlığı: External Political Efficacy in The Period of Pandemic as Agamben's State of Exception: An Investigation in The Framework of Social Impact Theory
Özet: In this study, it was prepared to find the answer to the question of how the preventive and precautionary measures taken and put into practice during the pandemic period, based on Agamben's concept of "State of Exception", created a change in the feelings of external political efficacy of university students within the framework of Social Impact Theory. In this context, a field study was conducted on university students and the data obtained were evaluated by using correspondence analyses with the help of SPSS 23 software. As a result of these evaluations, it has been observed that while the external political efficacy of individuals who are close to the political power and thus to the winning parties is high, those who support the opposition political parties are low. However, as understood from the open-ended questions we asked that the students generally perceived this process as outside of politics. a much more comprehensive “state of exception” than it was.

Makale Başlığı: Concentrate and Polyethylene Glycol Supplementation in in vitro Incubations Enhance Ruminal Fermentation Characteristics of Some Shrub Species
Özet: This study aims to determine the chemical composition and in vitro fermentation characteristics of Quercus coccifera, Phillyrea latifolia, Ephedra major, Spartium junceum leaves at different sampling periods and to determine the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and concentrate feed (CT) supplementation on fermentation kinetics in in vitro incubations. Shrub samples were harvested in March, April, June, July, September and October. The chemical composition and in vitro fermentation characteristics of the shrub species were determined. Furthermore, the nutritive value of shrub species were estimated with the requirements for model goats’ maintenance and lactation periods in respect to energy and protein concentration. Dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and total phenolic compounds (TP) concentration differed significantly among sampling periods (P < 0.05). The cumulative gas production of Quercus coccifera, Phillyrea latifolia and Ephedra major were significantly changed by sampling periods (P < 0.05). The PEG treatments significantly increased the cumulative gas production in Quercus coccifera and Ephedra major (P < 0.05). The CT treatments significantly increased cumulative gas production in Ephedra major (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it is thought that the shrub species that are the subject of this study will not be adequate to meet the nutrient needs of a high-yielding goat, and supplementary with protein-rich feeding, will be needed.

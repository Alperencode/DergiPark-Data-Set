Makale Başlığı: Osteoid Osteoma
Özet: Osteoid osteoma, which is one of the benign osteogenic tumors that is detected incidentally in radiological examinations mostly performed for another reason, causes more severe pain at night, independent of activity. Standard radiographs may show the lesion, but computed tomography (CT) is required for demonstrating the nidus and determining the exact location of the lesion. In this benign tumor, which has a radiolucent area called nidus, the pain has been associated with high intra-nidus prostaglandin E2 level. Stress fracture, cortical bone abscess, and intra-cortical osteosarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In its treatment, the nidus must be completely removed. Marginal resection, intralesional curettage and radiofrequency ablation are among the treatment options. If marginal resection was performed, the radiology of the specimen should show whether it contains the nidus.

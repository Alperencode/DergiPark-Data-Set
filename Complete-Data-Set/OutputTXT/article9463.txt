Makale Başlığı: Comparison of intrahepatic cholestasis incidence and maternal perinatal outcomes in fresh and frozen embryo transfers
Özet: Objective: To compare the perinatal and maternal results of intrahepatic cholestasis (ICP) in fresh and frozen-thawed embryo transfer (ET) pregnancies.Material and Method: This research was performed retrospectively, including fourty-five pregnant women applied to our hospital between October 2010 and January 2021. Two groups have been determined, group:1 (Frozen thawed; n:21) and group:2 (Fresh; n:24). Common pruritus in the body and high fasting bile acids (FBA) levels (greater than 10 mmol/L) were accepted as diagnostic criteria. The exclusion criteria were spontaneous pregnancies, multiple pregnancies, chronic liver disease history. SPSS, version 26 was used for statistical analysis.Results: Statistically significant difference could not be associated between the two groups regarding age, maternal body mass index (BMI), smoking status, number of trials, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), types of infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) incidence (p-value >0.05). The way of birth, gender, congenital anomaly, need for meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), weight of newborn at birth, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), gestational age at birth and 5 min Apgar score also compared and significantly difference could not be associated between two groups (p-value > 0.05).Conclusion: This study supports the fact that frozen-thawed and fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancies in terms of maternal characteristics and perinatal results have no difference.

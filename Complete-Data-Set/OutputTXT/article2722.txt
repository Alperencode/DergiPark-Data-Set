Makale Başlığı: The Restoration Works Carried out in Edirne Selimiye Complex in the Years 1761-1762
Özet: The Selimiye Complex (1568-1574) in Edirne must have been repaired and restored dozens of times since its construction. This is an inevitable result of natural and human-induced factors such as earthquake, fire, flood, war and time. Determining the nature of the restoration works in the Selimiye Complex, which is one of the most important representatives of Ottoman architecture is of great importance in revealing its original characteristics. In this article, the repair carried out in the years 1761-1762 is discussed. It is based on the reports (Keşf-i Evvel, Keşf-i Sânî) prepared by experts before and after the repair of buildings. In addition, the bureaucratic correspondence reflecting the preparation process of the reports and provisions regarding allocation of appropriations is examined. In this respect, first of all, the current situation of the Selimiye Complex is discussed in general terms; then, the repair organization in the Ottoman period is briefly investigated and the archival documents are introduced. Afterwards, Keşf-i Evvel and Keşf-i Sânî registers along with repair, restoration, and renewal activities in the Selimiye Complex are studied in detail and the data presented by the documents are evaluated comprehensively. With this article, the duration, cost and technique of the restoration carried out in the Selimiye Complex between 1761-1762 have been brought to light; it has been determined that some terms in architectural terminology have changed from past to present and the types, locations and partially architectural features of the structures that have completely disappeared today have been revealed.

Makale Başlığı: The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of University Staff
Özet: Background: The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of university staff. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August 2020 with 326 staff (academic n=184, administrative n=142) working at Yalova University. Data were collected online using the Descriptive Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12). Results: The anxiety, depression and stress mean scores of the participants were 3.87±3.12, 4.95±4.07; 3.98±3.84 respectively; and IUS-12 prospective anxiety sub-dimension mean score of 21.05±5.96, inhibitory anxiety 14.04±5.16, and total BTS-12 score average 35.10±10.37. It was determined that 20.9% experienced moderate depression, 23.6% experienced moderate anxiety and 5.2% experienced moderate stress. A moderately positive and significant correlation was observed between the DASS-21 mean scores of the participants and the BST-12 prospective anxiety, inhibitory anxiety sub-dimensions and total score averages (p<0.001). Being a woman, being single/widowed/divorced, being between the ages of 31-39, having postgraduate education, being an academic staff, having 1-2 people living in the family, having chronic diseases in themselves and their relatives, poor perception of health status, COVID-19 following up-to-date information about and applying the recommendations made by scientists were found to be factors that increase depression, anxiety, stress and/or intolerance to uncertainty (p<0.001, p<0.01, p<0.05). Conclusion: As the intolerance of uncertainty increases, the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of university staff participating in the research increase. It is important to develop support systems in strengthening the psychological resilience and coping mechanisms of university staff.

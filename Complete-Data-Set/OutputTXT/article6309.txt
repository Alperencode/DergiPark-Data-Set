The study sample consisted of 624 students, of which 339 were female and 285 were male. Researchwas carried out in two public schools located in a large metropole in the Aegean region of Turkey. Datawere collected using the Anger Expression Style Scale, the Bar-On Emotional Intelligence Scale Child andAdolescent Form, and the Self-Compassion Scale and then analyzed using SPSS 21. We discovered a negativerelationship between adolescents’ self-compassion and emotional intelligence levels and their trait anger,anger-in and anger-out variables. Beyond this, we found a positive, significant relationship between angercontrolmean scores.The regression analysis conducted as part of our study revealed that self-compassion and emotionalintelligence negatively predicted adolescents’ trait anger, anger-in, and anger-out variables in the first andsecond steps, respectively. On the other hand, we discovered that self-compassion and emotional intelligencepositively predicted anger control in the first and second steps, respectively. After comparing our findingswith those of previous studies in the literature, we discussed the similarities and differences between them.

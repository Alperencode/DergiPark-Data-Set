Angels are important in that they to be in touch of divine revelation and are the most powerful communication elements between God-prophet-human. In addition, with a holistic approach, the Qur’an deals not only with beings known through the senses, but also with extrasensory beings such as angels, jinns and devils. Therefore, many books, theses and articles have been prepared in the scientific world on this subject. Although it is different in terms of subject, content and method, literature study is very important in determining the study subjects. That’s why, it is important to identify studies on angels in Turkey.In article, related studies are handled in a structure that includes a summary/synthesis with critical evaluation skills. In this way, by presenting the strengths and weaknessesof the studies, the areas that need future research are revealed by identifying the missing points that are controversial in the literature. The study aims to examine not only theses but also articles, books and symposium reports in other disciplines by not limiting them to the field of Kalam.

Makale Başlığı: Classification of thorax computed tomography findings of Covid-19 patients, their correlation with clinical and laboratory data
Özet: Aim: The aim of the study is to classify patients infected with Covid-19 in our population according to the radiological consensus defined by Radiology Society of North America (RSNA) and American College of Radiology (ACR) and to show the relationship of the patients with clinical-laboratory findings.Material and Methods: 127 cases (74 males, 53 females; age range 19-92 years) who applied to Ankara City Hospital with symptoms such as fever, cough and respiratory distress and whose laboratory findings were compatible with Covid-19 were included in our study. The thorax computed tomography (CT) findings of the cases were classified according to the RSNA criteria and their relationship with clinical-laboratory data was statistically evaluated.Results: 47.2% of them had fever, 62.2% cough, 22 dyspnea, 4.7% diarrhea and 28.3% fatigue-malaise symptoms. When the thorax CT findings were evaluated, 55% of the patients had a typical appearance, 21% intermediate appearance, 11% atypical appearance and 13% negative appearance.Conclusion: It is obvious that thoracic CT examination has many advantages in evaluating Covid-19 pneumonia. However, it was concluded that more observations should be made in order to classify the findings better and to reveal their relationship with clinical-laboratory findings.

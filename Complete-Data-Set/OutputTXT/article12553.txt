Makale Başlığı: Forms and the Vezins/Usuls Used in Iranian Classical Music
Özet: In this study, the forms used in Iranian classical music and the vezins (usûls) used in these forms were researched and examined by considering the music journals called radif of important musicians such as Mirza Abdollah (d. 1918), Musa Ma’rufi (d. 1965) and Ali Akbar Shahnâzî (d. 1985) as well as the works and interpretations of important theoricians of Iranian music. In the radifs of Iranian music, besides the azad (free vezin) gushes which form the dastgahs and avazs, there are also gushes with vezin (rhytmic). The gushes with vezin which form dastgahs and avazs, besides being just a gushe with vezin, were also sometimes used in a specific and depicted form. It is possible to sort these forms used in Iranian classical music as tasnif ( فینصت ), pish daramad ( دمآرد شیپ ), chahar mezrab ( بارضم راهچ ), reng (گنرِ) ) and zarbi ( یبرض ). This study is limited to above-mentioned forms and local and religious music forms of Iran are not taken into the scope of the research. In this study, using historical musicology, literature review and comparison methods, tasnif, pish daramad, chahar mezrab, reng and zarbi forms and the vezins of the forms were examined and compared with the forms used in Turkish music. However, some information was given about the general structure of Iranian music in the introduction part in order to shed light on the theoretical ground of the study before this examination and comparison were made. At the end of the study, it was determined that 2/4, 3/4, 3/8, 4/4, 6/8 and 6/16 vezins were used in these forms. Moreover, it came out that the reng form reminds of the sirto and longa forms used in Turkish music.

Makale Başlığı: Emulation of burst-based adaptive link rates in NetFPGA towards green  networking
Özet: In recent times, energy consumption in communication media has been increasing drastically. In the literature,  energy-saving techniques that enable network devices to enter sleep state or limit the data rate have been proposed to  reduce energy costs. In our earlier work, we proposed an energy-saving technique called burst-based adaptive link rate   BBALR , the simulation of which assures increased energy savings. In this paper, we have emulated the hardware  implementation of BBALR and compared its performance with the outputs of other prominent energy-saving policies  based on dynamic link rate adaption. The energy savings are mapped from the measured sleep time and reference power  values. We have used NetFPGA as the testbed, which is a research platform for building real-time network hardware  prototypes.

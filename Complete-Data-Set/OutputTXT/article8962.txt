Makale Başlığı: Ottoman-British Diplomatic Relations İn the First Half of the 19th Century (1793-1853)
Özet: Although the relations between the Ottomans and the British date back to the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the first diplomatic contacts were made in the 16th century. After this date, the relations between the two states continued through diplomatic means with the Ottoman Empire in order to increase the commercial activities of England. During the reign of Selim III, permanent embassies were established in the capitals of European great Powers in order to better follow the developments in Europe and to ensure success in reform movements. One of them is the London embassy, where Yusuf Agâh Efendi was first appointed. But permanent embassies were closed as a result of the developments after III. Selim was deposed. As a part of the reform movements initiated by II. Mahmud, permanent embassies were re-established and diplomatic contacts with European states regained momentum. During this period, during two major events such as the Greek Revolt and the Egyptian Governor Mehmed Ali Pasha rebellion, England had an important place in the Ottoman diplomacy traffic. England, which stood still during the first phase of the Mehmed Ali Pasha rebellion, took action after the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Hünkar İskelesi with Russian and spent all its efforts to nullify this treaty. As a matter of fact, as a result of these efforts, on the other hand, it increased his commercial activities with the 1838 Balta Limani Trade Agreement, and on the other hand, it succeeded in deactivating the 1841 London Straits Convention and the Hünkar İskelesi Treaty.

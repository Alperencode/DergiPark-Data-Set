Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of LRIG1 Expression in Larynx Pathologies
Özet: Objective:  Studies  have  been  performed  on  many  biomolecules  to  determine  the  prognosis  of  LSCC  and  predict  the  course  of  the  disease.  However, a molecular marker that can be used clinically has not yet been found. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the expression levels of LRIG 1 in laryngeal cancer.Materials and Methods: In our study, 219 cases who underwent surgery due to LSCC and 88 randomly selected patients whose pathologic result were benign and premalignant lesions in Marmara University Pendik Education and Research Hospital between 2003 and 2018 were analyzed. Patients’ data were obtained from the medical records. The tissue microarray method was used to evaluate specimens.Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the tumor differentiation, diagnosis, and the expression of LRIG1 (respectively p=0.045, p<0.001). Also, an increase in the degree of dysplasia in premalignant lesions correlates with a decrease in LRIG1 expression (p=0.015).Conclusion:  Our  findings  suggest  that  LRIG1  plays  a  role  in  the  early  tumorigenesis  of  LSCC.  Therefore,  LRIG1  can  be  a  target  molecule  for  treatment approaches. However, LRIG1 was not correlated with overall survival of the LSCC.

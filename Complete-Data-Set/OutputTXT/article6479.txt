Makale Başlığı: Effects of different salt concentrations on the germination in some turfgrass varieties used in landscape applications
Özet: This study was conducted in laboratory conditions to determine the response of some cool season turf grass species (Lolium perenne Caddieshack, Lolium multiflorum Jivet, Poa pratensis Evora, Festuca rubra Rassinante, Festuca arundinacea Starlet, Festuca ovina Ridu) to different salt doses during the germination period. In the study, 8 different NaCl doses, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 mM, were applied, germination rate (%), germination time (%), plumula length (cm), radicula length (cm) and vigor index values were examined. Because of the research, it was observed that the germination rate, plumula and radicula lengths increased at 30 mM concentrations and in general, significant damage occurred after the dose of 90 mM. Lolium perenne Caddieshack and Lolium multiflorum Jivet species showed the highest mean values and were less affected by increasing salt doses in all properties examined.

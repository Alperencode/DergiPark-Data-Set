Makale Başlığı: NEIGHBORHOOD LAW IN MİFTAH-I BEHİŞT
Özet: The word “neighbour”, which is derived from the verb “kon-“, is used to express the relationship between people who are placed close to each other. Neighbor and neighbor law has been a very important issue both in Turkish culture and in terms of Islamic morality. The importance of neighborhood is frequently encountered in both written and oral cultural heritages. The last chapter of the work called Miftah-ı Behişt, which consists of fifteen chapters, was devoted to the law of neighborhood and the author talked about the law of neighborhood by supporting it with verses and hadiths. In this study, the importance of neighbor law in Turkish and Islamic culture will be discussed by considering neighborhood law, based on this religious-ethical manuscript written in the 19th century.

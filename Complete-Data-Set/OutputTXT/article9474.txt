Makale Başlığı: A comparison of obstetric and perinatal outcomes of spontaneous and in vitro fertilization (IVF) twin pregnancies
Özet: Aim: We aimed to compare and analyze the perinatal and obstetric outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) method and spontaneous twin pregnancies.Material and Method: Pregnant women who had had IVF and those with spontaneous fertilization in a tertiary perinatology center between January 2016 and January 2021 were retrospectively included in this study. The demographic data of the women (gender, age, gestational week) and fertilization types (spontaneous or IVF) were analyzed. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM), preterm delivery (PD), and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was recorded. Additionally, Apgar scores, the presence of fetal anomalies, the need for neonatal intensive care (NICU) and mortality were analyzed. Results: Overall, 261 women who were pregnant with twins were included in this study. The median age of the mothers was 29 years (min 15-max 40 years), and 23.8% were ≥35 years. Spontaneous and IVF pregnancies occurred in 75.9% and 24.1%, respectively. The most common problems in the twin pregnancies were PROM (14.6%), PD (13.4%), GHT (11.5%), oligohydramnios (6.1%), GDM (4.6%), and polyhydramnios (2.3%). Also, 13.8% had IUGR. The median age of the women with IVF pregnancies was higher than the spontaneous pregnancies (33.0 vs 28.0 years) (p<0.001). The maternal age was found to be significantly higher in those women with PD compared to those without PD (33.0 vs 28.0 years) (p=0.009). The incidence of PROM and the rate of PD were significantly higher in the IVF pregnancies group compared to the spontaneous pregnancies group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The postnatal 1st and 5th minute Apgar scores of the twin babies were significantly lower in the IVF group (p<0.001). Over the half of babies needed NICU and this rate was significantly higher in the IVF group compared to the spontaneous pregnancy group (71.4% vs 50.5%) (p=0.004).Conclusion: IVF twin pregnancies are risky pregnancies in terms of PROM and PD. Additionally, the need for NICU is higher for IVF twin birth pregnancies than for spontaneous twin pregnancies.

Makale Başlığı: The Impact of Inter-Services Intelligence on Pakistani Politics
Özet: Before the establishment of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) in Pakistan, the Intelligence Bureau and Military Intelligence agencies were working in the field of intelligence. The failure of intelligence during the First Kashmir War with India in 1947 necessitated the establishment of a new intelligence agency. ISI agency has a structure intertwined with the Pakistani army. As a result of this situation, the military administrations in Pakistan (including some civilian administrations) have strengthened the ISI agency by increasing their powers in order to maintain their power. In this article, the establishment process, strengthening and structure of the newly established Inter-Services Intelligence agency in Pakistan were examined. In addition, in the light of this information, the power of the organization in Pakistani politics and the effects of this power against the State of Pakistan were evaluated within the process. Thus, it is aimed to contribute to the understanding of the influential factors on the politics of strategically strong Pakistan.

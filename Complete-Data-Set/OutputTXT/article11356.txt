Özet: Hybrid, asymmetric, and proxy wars stand out among concepts that are used to understand changing nature of war. Analyzing war from different perspectives are important to the sense-making of changing the nature of war and shaping defense mechanism. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the two-month time frame of the Russia-Ukraine war that started on 24 February 2022 from hybrid, asymmetric, and proxy wars and to make an inference for threats to public security in the warfare environment. This examination was made by analyzing news and views taking part in the domestic and foreign press. As a result, it was understood that the Russia-Ukraine war reflects features of hybrid, asymmetric, and proxy wars. In addition, as a result of this war, it was understood that hard power in international relations area is still important, that the most important shield versus hybrid war is the trust mechanism between governmental organs and society, and this war may take a long time because of it reflects features of asymmetric warfare.

Makale Başlığı: Reverse Segond fracture and associated knee injuries; a case report and the review of 13 published cases
Özet: Reverse Segond fracture is originally described as an indirect radiographic clue for a specific injury complex of the knee joint that includes posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture and medial meniscal tear. Herein, we describe one further case with reverse Segond fracture associated with PCL avulsion fracture instead of PCL rupture which is only reported once previously. We also reviewed 13 previously published cases of reverse Segond fracture and discussed its demographic and clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and treatment options. According to current literature review, reverse Segond fracture is not only associated with PCL and medial meniscal injuries, but also frequently associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries. Furthermore, medial meniscus and PCL may remain intact. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0121This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

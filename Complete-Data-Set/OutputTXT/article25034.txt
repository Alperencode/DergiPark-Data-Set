Makale Başlığı: POLAND IN THE PAN-EUROPEAN TRANSPORT CORRIDORS NETWORK
Özet: Poland is strategically located in the centre of Europe. In the past this geographical position was the cause of many hardships, in particular of political nature. Nevertheless, after the accession to the European Union, it is becoming one of Poland’s main assets. It is of great significance to international transport services rendered between the Baltic Sea Region and Southern Europe. The aim of this article is to elaborate on the importance of Pan-European Transport Corridors running via Poland for international transport service in Poland.In the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) the sea transport represents over the half of the overall trade in the region. In the case of Poland the figure amounts to one third, however, it is estimated that the Polish share in the trading activity with the BSR states will be systematically increasing until 2020. The Polish maritime transport faces the increasing competition from the other transport modes – road and railway.It is more favourable for Poland building highways connecting the North and the South than the East and the West, since it will create conditions for cargo sent from Polish ports to bypass German harbours.

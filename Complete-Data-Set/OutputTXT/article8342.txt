Makale Başlığı: THE COURSE OF CHİLDREN'S POETRY IN IRAN
Özet: Children's poetry as a type of literature that exists in the literature of all or most nations, including Persian literature, should be considered as an independent subject in literature. Considering that less research has been done on Persian children's poetry so far, the author has tried to address the subject of children's poetry in Iran. Since he is the future child of a nation, it is important to pay attention to his literature. What children see, hear and read affects them mentally and physically. That is why special children's literature or children's literature is an urgent need for any nation. I explained that the concept of childhood has emerged in recent times, and children's literature goes back to this recent period of human history. To answer those who object, I have explained that the concept of childhood is not a biological concept, but a social one. When we talk about the social concept of the child and childhood, it means that In a given society, at what age is a person still considered a child, that is, a member of a community and family who is not yet expected to take on social responsibilities. So this concept is the gift of the advanced community of psychological sciences and especially child psychology.

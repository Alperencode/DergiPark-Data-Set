Makale Başlığı: In vitro ZnO Nanopartikülleriyle Geliştirilmiş Bezelye (Pisum sativum L.) Fidelerinin Büyümesi
Özet: Zinc is a minor micronutrient that is also involved in carbohydrate, protein synthesis metabolisms. The present study was carried out to analyze in response to DNSA, proline, protein and MDA (Malondialdehit) responses in the form of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in Pisum sativum, for a period of 21st and 35th days.  Two P. sativum (Maro Tarım and Kars) were used as the material in the presence of 0.8 ppm and 1.8 ppm ZnO nanoparticulate. The length and biomass of plants increased significantly upon ZnO NPs application. The activation of shoot and root length in two tested ecotypes was remarkably increased by ZnO. Accumulation of Zn increasedin presence of 0.8 ppm Zn+ nanoparticle in P. sativum, which lower concentration more affected than higher concentration in terms of growth parameters. The amount of protein showed an increase, while those of DNSA and proline response to ZnO NPs in the higher concentration. However, there were significant differences between control and ZnO treatments in response to DNSA and proline. Malondialdehyde content displayed a gradual increase in leaf samples of P. sativum plants.  The results suggest that lower application of ZnO NPs (0.8 ppm) could be promoted to the development process of plants and can be stimulated as a Zn regulator factor for crop physiological mechanisms.

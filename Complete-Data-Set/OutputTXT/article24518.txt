Makale Başlığı: THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF WAR IN A CYBER-WORLD AND ITS IMPACT ON THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW
Özet: War as a social construct of dominating others to achieve ones interest at the expense of otherin a competitive global community is an enigma to resolve in the discourse of InternationalHumanitarian Law. Thus, the salience of the transformations of the structure of war in themidst of the current transition of geopolitics from a unipolar world to a seemingly multi-polarworld reverberate the debate of international law within the domain of cyber technologicalweapons, specifically, International Humanitarian Law. This has raised many questions in theapplication of international humanitarian law in a world where electromagnet weapons, cyberweapons and high-tech defensive system are developed to counter enemy attack. This paperdiscuss the changing nature of war in a cyber-world bringing to bear its impact on theInternational Humanitarian Law. The paper posits that with the fast changes in war strategyand cyber oriented weaponry, an improved sophisticated and inclusive laws with a strongerinstitutional backing must be developed considering the socio-cultural and technological ideasof countries to increase the level of compliance.

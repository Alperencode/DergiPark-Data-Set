Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of cardiovascular disease risk factors, inflammatory markers and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with hemophilia
Özet: Aim: To assess and compare the risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) between patients with hemophilia (PwH) and healthy controls in a single center cohort in Türkiye.Materials and Methods: Anthropometric parameters including height, weight, and body mass index were recorded. Fasting glucose, HbA1c, high sensitive C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, lipid parameters (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides) were assessed. International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) measurements were performed. The data from PwH (n=80) and healthy controls (n=36) were compared. Independent associates of CIMT value were analyzed.Results: Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and smoking frequencies were remarkable in PwH. Family history of CVD was significantly more frequent ( p=0.005) and when considered with IPAQ scores; PwH was much more sedentary than controls (p<0.001). Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol were significantly higher in the control group (p =0.003,=0.003) while hs-CRP levels were higher in PwH (p=0.009). Age and IPAQ score were significant independent predictors of CIMT (p=0.004 and 0.003, respectively).Conclusion: As a result of aging; PwH exposure to the same CVD risk factors as the general population. Screening for CVD risk factors in PwH other than hemophilia evaluation will be essential.

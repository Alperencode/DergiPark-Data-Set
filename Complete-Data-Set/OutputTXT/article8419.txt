Makale Başlığı: An examination on the rotio and proportion concepts located in elementary curricula in terms of interdisciplinary relationships
Özet: The concepts of ratio and proportion have an important part in elementary and secondary education level. These concepts which are very closely related to proportional thinking skills, are of critical importance in terms of science and mathematics courses at this level. In the studies conducted on the former curricula of such disciplines, it has been stated that the curricula of both courses does not have coordination in terms of supporting with each other. Therefore, those ones need be investigated in order to understand whether a similar coordination problem exists. In this study, it is emphasized whether the coordination problem mentioned is present in the relevant curricula being used, and how interdisciplinary connections can be made by considering the skills related to the aim of handling the mentioned problem. In this study, which was conducted by the document analysis, a qualitative study methods, the curricula of the relevant courses were subjected to content analysis in terms of the analyzing unit related to "rate” and “proportion". As a result of the comparison of both curricula skills in the context of ratio and proportion, it was concluded that the curricula of both courses were not in coordination. It has been determined that those integrated concepts are included in the mathematics curriculum for the first time approximately 16 weeks after the beginning of the sixth grade curriculum, and the relevant skills in the science curriculum are included from the 14th week at the 6th grade level. The results are important for understanding the timing of interdisciplinary relationships in the context of proportional thinking skills between the specified curricula for the teachers, adults and curriculum developers.

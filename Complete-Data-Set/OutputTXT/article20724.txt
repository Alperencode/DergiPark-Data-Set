Makale Başlığı: Using graphitic carbon nitride/graphene hybrid structures to ımprove supercapacitor performance
Özet: Designing high-efficiency, low-cost hybrid nanostructures with suitable morphology and excellent conductivity is promising for electrodes used in electrochemical storage devices. This study includes the results obtained from electrochemical studies and the production of a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid structure consisting of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGOH) structures for supercapacitor (SC) applications. As it is known, increasing the amount of specific capacitance in the supercapacitor is directly proportional to the contact surface between the electrode and the electrolyte used in the structure. Therefore, since the rGOH structure has a high surface area and thermal stability, and g-C3N4 increases the electrochemical activity in supercapacitors, the specific capacitance value of the electrode obtained by combining the existing structures was measured. By producing this electrode to be used as a supercapacitor, a high specific capacitance value was obtained. As a result of electrochemical studies, a high capacitance value of 157.4 F/g was obtained at 5 mVs-1 scanning speed of the g-C3N4@rGOH hybrid structure. It also demonstrated an unmatched cyclic stability performance of 112% at 1000 cycles.

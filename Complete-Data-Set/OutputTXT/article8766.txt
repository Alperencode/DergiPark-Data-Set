Makale Başlığı: Is there any connection between zinc deficiency and poor obstetric outcomes in pregnancy?
Özet: Aim: The present study aims to examine the effects of zinc deficiency on maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy. Material-method: The study was carried out in a secondary care hospital between 2020 January and 2020 December. Demographic data of all patients, zinc, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) levels at birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as oligohydramnios, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) were recorded. Maternal serum zinc levels of <56 μg/dL were considered deficient, whereas maternal serum zinc levels of ≥56 μg/dL were considered normal. Maternal and neonatal outcomes of the zinc-deficient group and the zinc-deficient group were compared. Results: Zinc deficiency was found in 36(35.2%) of these patients. The group with sufficient zinc levels had a mean zinc level of 74 μg/dL (56-120), while the group with zinc deficiency had a mean zinc level of 50 μg/dL (36-55) (p:0.000). The rates of PPROM and preterm delivery were significantly higher in the zinc-deficient group (p=0.03,p=0.039, respectively). The zinc-deficient group had significantly lower 1st and 5th minute APGAR scores (p=0.002, p=0.001, respectively). Zinc deficiency significantly increased the risk of PPROM by 1.7 times and preterm birth by 0.479 times (OR=1.713, 95% CI=0.662-0.824, p=0.043; OR=0.479, 95% CI=0.209-0.095, p=0.041, respectively).Conclusion: The results of this research indicate that pregnant women who were zinc deficient had a higher rate of preterm delivery and PPROM. In conclusion, zinc supplements given to pregnant women, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy, will reduce the negative perinatal outcomes associated with zinc deficiency.

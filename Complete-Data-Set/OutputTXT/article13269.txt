Makale Başlığı: Turkish teachers' opinions on secondary school grammar subject order: Problems and solution suggestions
Özet: The main purpose of this research is to determine the problems in the current curriculum for secondary school grammar subject order and to determine the solutions offered for these problems. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty Turkish teachers working in various cities in the study, which was carried out according to the case study, one of the qualitative research designs. Research data were collected with a semi-structured interview form. Through the interviews, the problems seen in the current curriculum were determined in the order of 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th-grade grammar topics, Turkish teachers' suggestions for solutions to these problems were taken, and the analysis of these views was carried out by dividing them into main and sub-categories. In the study, it was concluded that after the simplicity of grammar in the 5th grades, the density of the grammar topics in the 6th grades was very high; and that certain topics in the 6th grades should be distributed to the 5th and 7th grades and the density should be reduced. In addition, it was determined that the additional verb subject in the 7th-grades and the gerundial topics in the 8th-grades should be handled more superficially. It has been concluded that the subject of expression disorder, which is given in two stages in the 7th and 8th grades in the current curriculum, should be handled as a single topic in the 7th or 8th grades to ensure the integrity of the topic. Another important result obtained was the fact that some terms in the 5th-grades about spelling belong to the subject of the sentence elements taught in the 8th-grades, which also poses a problem in terms of understanding the topics. The data obtained in the study were discussed in the context of previous studies in the field of grammar and suggestions were presented.

Makale Başlığı: Validity and Reliability Analysis of the Turkish Version of the Sound Preference and Hearing Habits Questionnaire (Tr-SPHHQ)
Özet: Objectives: The aim of this study is to perform the Turkish adaptation, validity and reliability assessment of the Sound Preference and Hearing Habits Questionnaire (SP-HHQ) in normal hearing individuals. The second aim is to evaluate the sounds and listening preferences and habits of normal hearing individuals (NH), of hearing impaired but not using hearing aids (HI), and of individuals using hearing aids (HA). Materials and Methods: This study was conducted with 489 participants aged 18-68 (37,73±12,89) with NH, HI and HA. The SP-HHQ and The Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults was applied electronically. Results: The general Cronbach's α and Spearman-Brown coefficients of the Turkish version of the SP-HHQ were found to be 0,90 and 0,93, respectively. The fit indexes of the model were obtained as χ^2=492,871, df=209,χ^2/ df=2,358, Root Mean Square Errors of Approximation=0,066; Comparative Fit Index=0,905, Goodness of Fit Index=0,874. A significant difference was found between the SP-HHQ scores of the NH, HI and HA groups in One-Way ANOVA test (p<0.01).  According to the Tukey HSD test results, a difference was found between the scale scores of individuals with NI and IE (p<0.001) and individuals with IE and IC (p<0.001). Conclusion: The psychometric evaluation of the Turkish version of the SP-HHQ shows that the questionnaire has high reliability and acceptable validity. The OST-DA questionnaire can be used in clinical and research settings as a preliminary screening tool that will provide information about sound preferences and habits of individuals wearing hearing aids.

Makale Başlığı: Effects of Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) on seed germination and development in Rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.) and Cress (Lepidium sativum L.)
Özet: Rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.) is cultivated throughout the year. Thanks to the rich metabolites of its leaves, it has a wide usage area in pharmacy. Cress (Lepidium sativum) is in the group of annual vegetables and has a herbaceous structure. Due to its fragrant and slightly spicy structure, it is a vegetable that is used as an appetizer. Its seeds and green parts are very beneficial for health. Rocket is a short-day plant whose leaves are considered to be rich in many minerals and vitamins. The present research was conducted to investigate the effects of doses of Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) (0 (control), 15, 30, 45, 60 mg L-1 on the germination and development of seeds of rocket and cress plants grown in pot experiments. In order to determine the effect of DOT on the development and yield of rocket and cress plants, the percentage of germinated seeds, cotyledon length and dry matter amounts were determined. ANOVA test was used to analyze the data obtained in the present study. Tukey test was used to determine which groups were insignificant differences between the groups. Overall, it was seen that there were significant growth differences between the doses used statistically, the dose of 45 mg L-1 DOT positively affected the germination and dry matter content of rocket and cress seeds.

Makale Başlığı: A PROPOSAL FOR THE PRESERVATION AND REPURPOSING OF SARIKAMIŞ HISTORICAL CER ATELIERS INSPECTORSHIP BUILDING
Özet: Sarıkamış district of Kars province, which has hosted many civilizations from the past to the present, holds many historical buildings that are historically and culturally important. One of these buildings, the Revizor's Office (historical drawing workshops), constitutes an important landmark for the region in terms of its architecture and location as a historical document. The building has survived from the time it was built to the present day without any changes. However, today it is idle and may face the danger of extinction if necessary protection activities are not carried out. In this article, firstly, the historical and architectural values and architectural features of these structures are introduced. Then, a proposal is put forward for the purpose of utilizing the historical revision office building with a new function and the main principles of the project are determined. The proposed conservation project aims at keeping the building alive, transferring it to future generations and preserving the historical identity of the city.

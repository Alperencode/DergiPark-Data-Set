Makale Başlığı: COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE METHODS USED IN LABOR
Özet: The concept of birth is a natural phenomenon that has an important place in the life of women since the existence of mankind. Today, with the developing technology, the act of birth has become one of the medical initiatives that has been stripped of its naturalness. Due to the negative changes in the physiological and hormonal structure of women due to all kinds of external interventions, spontaneous and non-intervention birth is supported and recommended today.Due to the fact that the birth pain that occurs spontaneously during childbirth, the worries and fears that arise due to obscurity cannot be controlled by the mother, the mother's need for support is increasing. This need can be met with alternative medicine methods, the use of which has a long history and the use of which has increased in recent years, and the burden of healthcare workers is alleviated by preventing the side effects that may occur due to the use of medications. In this review, it is aimed to examine alternative methods that relieve the mother by reducing both pain and emotional tension that are often used during labor within the scope of the literature.

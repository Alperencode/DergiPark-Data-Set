Makale Başlığı: The Importance and Role of Non-Governmental Organizations in the Fight Against Poverty in Turkey
Özet: Today, one of the most important problems of states and nations is the phenomenon of poverty. Poverty, which has existed since the beginning of humanity and has continued, has also always been the subject of research in social sciences. The researches and the results have generally dealt with the issue of revealing the imbalances in the income distribution in the society and how to combat these imbalances. With the emergence of economic and social problems, a structural change began to occur in the family and society, and in this process, the state, local governments and non-governmental organizations began to take more active roles and duties. In Turkey and in the world, the understanding that the fight against poverty is not only the duty of the state, and that the society as a whole, either as single individuals or through non-governmental organizations, should assume responsibility by supporting the activities of the state in this field or by direct social assistance has begun to become widespread and expressed. In this respect, non-governmental organizations try to carry out their activities in the fight against poverty voluntarily and away from the authority of the state. Thus, in this study, written sources related to the subject were used, the relevant data were evaluated in terms of their relations with the subject and samples were given according to the needs.

Makale Başlığı: Effects of Thymoquinone (TQ) on the Molecular Structure and Total Antioxidant Capacity of Cerebellum Tissue of Healthy Rats
Özet: Objective: The neuroprotective effects of thymoquinone (TQ), the active compound of Nigella sativa, have been reported in accordance with the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant features of this drug. It has been suggested that the cerebellum plays a considerable role in neurodegenerative processes. In the current study, the possible effects of TQ on the structure and composition of cerebellum tissues and its total antioxidant capacity were studied dose-dependently. Materials and Methods: Fifteen adult Long Evans female rats were divided into groups as follows: G1: Control, G2: 10 mg/kg TQ treatment, G3: 20 mg/kg TQ treatment. TQ was injected into the rats intraperitoneally for two weeks. The control group only received corn oil used for the dissolving of TQ. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies and total protein, and antioxidant capacity measurements were carried out with cerebellum tissues which were removed following the decapitation of rats.  Results  and  Conclusion:  10  mg/kg  TQ  treatment  improved  the  saturated  and  unsaturated  lipid  and  protein  content  in  addition  to  decreasing nucleic acid content and lipid peroxidation and increasing the total antioxidant capacity of cerebellum tissues. However, 20 mg/kg TQ treatment did not have any significant effect.

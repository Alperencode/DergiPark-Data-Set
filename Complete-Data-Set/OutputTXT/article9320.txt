Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of iliotibial band volume with 3T MRI
Özet: Aim: The aim of our study is to evaluate the iliotibial band thickness (ITBT) and volume (ITBV) according to age and gender with 3 T MRI in a healthy Turkish population.Material and Method: In the current study, 150 patients who had knee MRI were retrospectively evaluated. They were divided into the following groups to examine the effects of age: group 1: 18–30 years old; group 2: 31–40 years old; group 3: 41–50 years old; and group 4: 51–60 years old. ITBV measurements were performed on axial T2-weighted knee MR images.Results: The mean age was 42.2±29.6 (range 18-60) years. The mean ITBT was 1.76±0.22 mm and the mean ITBV was 20,24±1,44 mm3 in all patients. There was statistically significant difference in mean iliotibial band thickness and volume between genders (p=0.001; p=0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in mean iliotibial band thickness and volume values between the groups in the one-way ANOVA test (p >0.05). Conclusion: Radiological studies on iliotibial band thickness and band area in healthy individuals are new in the literature. This study is the first radiological study in which the volume of the iliotibial band was measured in healthy individuals and was performed on a 3 tesla MR device. Also, it is the first study that is used artificial intelligence for iliotibial band evaluation and the technic is effective and more rapid according to our experience. ITBV and ITBT are statistically significantly higher in males than females. Most thick ITB was detected between the ages of 31-40. The values of our study, especially ITBT, differ from previous studies and the values are altered in a wide range. Therefore, standardization in the calculation is necessary. This topic is open to future research.

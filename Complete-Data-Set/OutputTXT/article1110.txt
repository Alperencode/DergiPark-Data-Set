Makale Başlığı: THE SHIRVANIS ILLUMINATE ANATOLIA AND SHIRVANI POETS IN AMASYA
Özet: Anatolia has always been the center of science and art and has attracted scholars and artisans from many geographies. Amasya, one of Anatolia's science and art centers, is an important cultural city that has managed to become one of these attraction centers. Amasya was home to hundreds of scholars and artisans in the field of Azerbaijan as well as all over the world in the Seljuk and Ottoman Periods. Because of the abundance of scholars from the Shirvan region, those who came here were called Shirvani, a known name.In the twelve-volume work titled Amasya History, Hüseyin Hüsameddin Yasar wrote the biographies of these names one by one and left an immortal resource. In our study, based on this work, we will try to introduce the Shirvanis who became famous in Anatolia, especially in Amasya. These names showed themselves in many different layers of society, from the grand vizier to the lowest official. However, their common feature is that they always take science and art to the fore. It is almost as if the Shirvanis weaved Anatolia's religious, mystic and artistic life. It is a fact that without the Shirvanis, many sciences and arts would be incomplete in Anatolia, especially in Amasya.Here, with this study, in which we will list these important names alphabetically and summarize the information about them, we will have obtained a neat "table of Shirvani scholars and poets in Anatolia, especially in Amasya".

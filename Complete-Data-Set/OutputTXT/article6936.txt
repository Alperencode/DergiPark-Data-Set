Makale Başlığı: Anatomical Structure of The Proximal Part of the Ulna
Özet: Background: The shape of the proximal ulna is one of the factors affecting the stabilization of the fractures and the rehabilitation of functions after surgery. If normal anatomical structuring cannot be achieved during reduction, this may cause joint dislocations, arthritis and loss of function. In small fragmented fractures where reduction cannot be performed completely, the anatomical structuring can be supported with the help of an appropriate plate. In cases where plate use is required, it is important to know the proximal ulna structure in detail.Materials and metods: This study was carried out on 62 (unspecified gender, 26 right and 36 left ulna) ulnas in the bone collection of Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram Medical Faculty, Department of Anatomy. In our study, angle measurements were performed along with the length and width measurements of the proximal ulna.Results: In our study, the mean total ulna length (UU) was determined as 24.59±2.00 cm. The mean radial notch height (IRY) and width (IRG) measurements were determined as 9.69±1.64 mm and 15.22±2.18 mm, respectively. Trochlear notch depth (ITD) was determined to vary between 7.30 and 13.70 mm (average 10.15 mm). The mean angles of PUTA, VA, AA, PUDA, TA, ODA were determined as 13.40±1.23º, 9.20±1.85º, 20.37±1.02º, 5.85±2.21º, 18.99±0.83º, 15.49±3.10º, respectively.Conclusions: Implants and prostheses, which are designed considering individual differences, increase the success rate of compatibility in the elbow joint and ensure the proper functioning of the joint.

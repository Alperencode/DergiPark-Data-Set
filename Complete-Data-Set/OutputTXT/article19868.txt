Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of HBsAg, Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV Reactivity in Covid-19 Patients
Özet: Objective:MethodsMethods2 emerged in China’s Wuhan province in 2019 and spread allover the world in a short period of time. It is a positive-sense, enveloped RNA virus that belong to the Coronaviridae family and is the causative agent of Covid-19 disease. It primarily represents with pulmonary manifestations, but it can affect many systems, especially the liver. Measures taken to educethe impact of the pandemic caused disruptions in the follow-up and treatment of chronic diseases such as hepatitis. In this study, HBsAg, Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV parameters and mortality rates of patients with confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis admitted to our hospital and followed up in out patient clinics, services and intensive care units were investigated.Methods: HBsAg, Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV data of patients whose diagnoses were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were obtained retrospectively from the hospitalin formation system.Results: There were 749 patients included in the study, 352 (47%) male and 397 (53%) female. The patients were divided into two groups according to survival. The meanage of the mortal group (n=144) was found to be higher than the survivor group (n=605) with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). When the mortality rates in the patient groups with reactive HBsAg and Anti-HCV results were examined, no statistically significan tdifference was found (p=0.59, p=0.13, respectively). The patients were divided into three sub groups according to the units theywerefollowed, as outpatientclinic (n=265), services (n=357) andintensivecareunit (n=127). The mortality rate of the patients followed in the intensive care unit was higher andstatistically significant (p<0.001).Conclusion: We think that, in addition to the primary effects of the pandemic on public health, it also has negative effects on the follow-up and treatment of chronic diseases and it is necessary to contribute to theliterature by conductings tudies on this subject.Objective

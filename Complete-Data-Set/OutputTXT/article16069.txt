Makale Başlığı: Investigation of predatory Orius species (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) in Balcalı District of Adana Province, Turkey
Özet: In this study, the presence of predatory Orius (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) species was investigated on different cultivated plants in the Balcalı District of Adana Province, Turkey in 2019-2020. Surveys were carried out on some summer and winter vegetables, field crops and fruit trees. In the sampling units, 20 plants from annual herbaceous cultivars and 10 plants from perennial woody cultivars were randomly selected. The flowers of the plants were included in the samples. Insects were collected by shaking the upper parts of herbaceous plants and the flowering shoots of fruit trees into a container. Individuals of Orius niger Wolff, Orius laevigatus (Fieber), Orius albidipennis (Reuter) and Orius vicinus Ribaut (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) were collected. The total number of adult Orius individuals collected was 211. Orius laevigatus was the most common species (69.7%), followed by the O. niger (29.4%), of all adults.

organs; Clinical features and surgical outcomes of double center experience
Özet: Objective: Hydatid disease (HD) is a parasitic infestation that most commonly caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. Peritoneal echinococcosis (13%) is usually secondary and primary peritoneal HD is very rare and only sporadic cases have been reported Methods: The demographic data, imaging findings, indirect hemaglutination test (IHAT) levels, surgical approaches, pathological findings, complications and outcomes were analysed. Results: The localization of the hydatid cyst are spleen, as an intraabdominal cys, right adrenal gland, mesentery of the transvers colon, omentum and left tuba, as a pelvic cys, right tuba, and uterus. The surgical procedures includes splenectomy, total cystectomy, partial cystectomy and omentoplasty, total cystectomy and omentectomy, and right adrenalectomy. Conclusion: Isolated primary peritoneal cyst without the presence of cysts in the other intraabdominal organs is very rare and has been reported about 2% of all abdominal HD. The differential diagnosis of primary peritoneal echinococcosis also includes soft tissue tumors, intraperitoneal abscess, cystic lymphangioma, embryonal cyst, ovarian neoplasms, teratoma, and other cystic and necrotic solid tumors. The management of extrahepatic HD is based on the size and location of the cysts and the health status of the patient. The goal of the surgery is removal of the cyst without any spillage.

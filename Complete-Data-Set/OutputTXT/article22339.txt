Makale Başlığı: Paraben Substituted Monospiro-Cyclotriphosphazene Compounds: Synthesis and Characterization
Özet: Parabens are among the potential biologically active compounds due to their low toxicity potential for humans and their effective antibacterial and antifungal activity. The properties of cyclotriphosphazenes increase their efficiency according to the properties of the side groups to which they are attached. For this reason, scientists use it as a platform to design target molecules in particular. In this study, new types paraben substituted monospiro-cyclotriphosphazene compounds (5-7) were successfully synthesized and these compounds were fully characterized by MALDI-TOF mass, 1H, 31P and 13C spectroscopy techniques. The molecular structure of compound 5 was also determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography.

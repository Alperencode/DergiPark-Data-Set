Makale Başlığı: The Intermediate Role of Supply Chain Innovation on the Effect of Innovative Leadership on Supply Chain Performance
Özet: In the study, the mediating role of supply chain innovation on the effect of innovative leadership on supply chain performance is investigated. Although there are many studies in the literature on the factors affecting supply chain innovation and supply chain performance, there are very few studies that include the innovative leadership effect. It is thought that the research subject, the model developed for the study, the applied sector (health services) and the findings would contribute to the literature. The reason for the selection of the health sector for the study is the fact that the Covid 19 pandemic has increased the importance of healthcare supply all over the world. In this context, the hypotheses of the study are tested with multiple regression analyzes with the data obtained from 418 public and private hospitals in Turkey by using a five-point Likert type questionnaire as the data collection method in the research. As a result of the analyzes made it is determined that innovative leadership and supply chain innovation have positive effects on supply chain performance. In the study, it is also seen that supply chain service and process innovation have a mediating role in the effect of innovative leadership on supply chain speed and environmental performance.

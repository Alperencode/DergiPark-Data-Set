Makale Başlığı: Synthesis, Characterization, and Comparison of Disinfectant Bioactivity Test of Two Triphenyltin(IV) Compounds
Özet: This paper aims to report the synthesis of two new organotin(IV) carboxylate derivatives, triphenyltin(IV) 4-aminobenzoate (2) and triphenyltin(IV) 4-nitrobenzoate (3) and to examine their antibacterial activity as a disinfectant. These compounds were prepared by reacting triphenyltin(IV) hydroxide (1) with 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, respectively. Compound (2) was obtained as a yellow solid with a yield of 84.09% and compound (3) in the form of a white solid with a yield of 80.70%. These compounds were well characterized using UV-Vis spectrometry, FT-IR spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The bioactivity test as a disinfectant was tested against Salmonella typhosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The activity test was carried out by measuring the optical density (OD) of the tested compounds with concentration variations of 5x10-3, 1x10-3, and 5x10-4 M in methanol and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), commercial Wipol (2.5% pine oil) was used as a positive control with observations monitored at contact times of 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. The results showed that of both compounds were active against the two bacteria compared to the positive control with compound 3 found to be more active than compound 2.

Makale Başlığı: Public spaces of rural architecture at risk of destruction: Laundries
Özet: The basis of rural settlements is the consciousness of doing business together under the influence of production dynamics and the culture of cooperation, sharing and social relations. The daily life, which continues with being together, solidarity and cooperation, develops around the village common room, coffeehouse, mill, bakery, tannery and laundries, which constitute the spaces of social relations together with the residences where the private life takes place and its immediate surroundings. The individuals who make up the community come together for a purpose in these places, both realize the purpose and know, learn, have fun and share by communicating. However, the majority of these spaces are not used as before or are completely out of use due to the differentiation of production dynamics and the updating of comfort conditions in accordance with contemporary living requirements. The places/structures that are out of use, on the other hand, become obsolete day by day, being forgotten by withdrawing from social life and disappearing physically. Within the scope of this study, laundries, which are one of the important representatives of rural architectural heritage and are in the process of disappearing very quickly due to their being out of use today, are the subject. Within the scope of the study, the laundries that were previously documented were determined by making a literature search, and the laundries were documented by conducting a field study in the Seyitgazi district of Eskişehir and Eskigediz district of Kütahya. Brought together to prevent the disappearance of an architectural culture and presented within the scope of typology, comparison and various discussions.

Makale Başlığı: Personal Names in Textbooks for German as a Foreign Language as representation of their country of origin
Özet: In foreign language teaching, along with language, the culture of that language is also taught. For this reason, textbooks contain much information about the target language’s culture and country, such as their traditions, eating and drinking habits, idioms, and celebrities. These include personal names and they, too, provide information about the country and its culture.This study aimed to investigate how the personal names in German textbooks represented the target language’s country and culture. It was also investigated whether the personal names had accompanying nationality information. Moreover, it was attempted to determine the prevalence/popularity of the names and whether there was a difference in German and Turkish names in this respect. Within the scope of the research, the first units of three local A1.1 level German language textbooks, Deutsch, Plus+Deutsch and Wie Bitte? used in Turkey’s high schools were examined.

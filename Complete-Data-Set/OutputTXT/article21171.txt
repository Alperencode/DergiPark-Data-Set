Makale Başlığı: Use of Powdered Steel Slag in Cement-Bentonite Slurry Wall Construction
Özet: Thispaper presents a comprehensive laboratory investigation into the workability,permeability and unconfined compressive strength of powdered-steel-slag,lime-amended cement-bentonite backfills using several series of mixtures. Prepared mixtures comprise various proportions of cement,bentonite, powdered steel slag, and lime,which have been tested for particle size distribution (PSD), liquid limit,plastic limit, permeability, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Foreach mixture, the effect of varying curing time was investigated. Theresults show that the permeability of the powdered steel-slag, lime-amendedcement-bentonite backfill is near enough to the 10-9 m/s (10-7 cm/s) required by standards. The laboratoryobservations clearly show that cement-bentonite-steel slag (CBS) backfill-evaluatedin this study strengthens with time. When placed, the backfill is viscousliquid; later, it is a material strong enough to stand vertically. Amendedmixtures including 9% of bentonite content have identified that they do notonly give higher strength values but also present lower permeability considersto other mixtures as two most important keys in slurry wall construction.Therefore, it is concluded that CB–powdered steel slag–lime blended mixturesare superior materials for constructing slurry walls.

Makale Başlığı: A THEMATIC CLASSIFICATION ON THE NAMES OF EQUİPMENTS RELATED TO AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK IN EASTERN ANATOLIA REGION PROVINCIAL DIALECTS
Özet: The ancient Turks who had an equestrian-nomadic economy and a nomadic lifestyle, mostly made their living from animal husbandry, kept livestock and kept horses and sheep. Living in the steppe culture and having a nomadic culture led to a widespread belief that the Turks were only engaged in animal husbandry and did not have an agricultural culture. However, studies show that Turks were engaged in agriculture before the periods that can be traced through written documents. The vocabulary of Old Turkish about agriculture, Chinese annuals and the finds unearthed in archaeological excavations give about important clues about the agricultural life of the Turks.Dialect studies are important building blocks in the emergence of the phases of a language, in illuminating its historical periods, and in determining the vocabulary. In this respect, Turkey Turkish dialects are an important source in determining the rich vocabulary related to agriculture and animal husbandry.In this study, the names of tools and goods related to agriculture and animal husbandry in Eastern Anatolian Dialects were determined. For this purpose, with the Compilation Dictionary, books, theses and articles on Eastern Anatolian Dialects were scanned and the identified vocabulary was classified.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF HYPERURICEMIA ON RENAL OUTCOMES IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH NEPHROTIC SYNDROME
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of hyperuricemia at the time of diagnosis and to investigate whether hyperuricemia has an effect on renal outcome in adult patients with nephrotic syndrome. Material and Methods: Patients who applied to the Nephrology Clinic between 2010-2021 and underwent kidney biopsy were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by evaluating the laboratory and follow-up data of the patients. Results: Of the 106 patients included in the study, 59.4% were male and the mean age was 49.4 years. Of the cases, 72.6% had primary and the rest had secondary nephrotic syndrome. Hyperuricemia was detected in 54 (51%) of the cases. The mean uric acid level was 6.80 mg/dl. The frequency of hyperuricemia in primary nephrotic syndrome was 47.4% and 62.1% secondary nephrotic syndrome. Response to treatment was observed in 62.3% of patients with primary nephrotic syndrome and 17.2% of patients with secondary nephrotic syndrome (p<0.0001). In patients with hyperuricemia (n=54), the glomerular filtration rate was lower (54.4 vs. 72.67 ml/min. p=0.007) and the rate of sterile pyuria pyuria was higher (38.9vs 9.6%; p=0.03). Conclusion: Hyperuricemia is seen in half of adult nephrotic syndrome cases This situation is correlated with the severity of the kidney failure.

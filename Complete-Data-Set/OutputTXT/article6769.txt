Makale Başlığı: Covid -19 Pandemic: A Short Visit to Beck's Risk Community or Permanent Residential!
Özet: Although the Covid-19 pandemic is a global health crisis, it comes to mind first that it is the subject of medicine, but it has strong sociological dimensions with its causes and consequences. In the study, the risk society theory of Sociologist Ulrick Beck was examined in order to understand the Covid-19 pandemic, which was experienced for the first time as a global disaster, its effect is expected to last for many years, and contains uncertainties for the future with its negative impact on all social areas. In his theory, which has attracted great attention since its publication, Beck described the transformation process of the industrial society into a risk society, what it means to be a risk society, and the changes experienced in the society in this process. Covid-19 pandemic experienced globally since December 2019; It has been examined in relation to the similar and divergent aspects of Beck's theory of risk society. Starting from the zoonotic origin of the Covid-19 pandemic, the multiple social, political and economic effects were explained by associating it with the epidemic period. It has been discussed whether the risk society theory is an approach that helps explain the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the theory, the Covid-19 pandemic can be considered as a manufactured risk. The social, political and economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are in line with the risk society theory.

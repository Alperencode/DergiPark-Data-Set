Makale Başlığı: Innovative Approaches Used by Universities in Nursing Education in Turkey
Özet: Objective: Nurse educators need to include innovative approaches in the nursing curriculum to increase students’ professional knowledge and skills to initiate and sustain innovation. This study aimed to determine the use of innovative approaches to nursing education in nursing schools in Turkey that provide education at the university level.Material and Method: The research is designed in descriptive type. The universe of study at the graduate level of nursing education in Turkey has created 128 universities. From this universe, 89 universities responded to the survey questions by mail between August 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020, constituting the search sample. The data were collected by the “Survey on Innovation Profile” prepared by researchers through a literature review.Results: 32.6% of the nursing programs included in the study have provided undergraduate education for 1-10 years, and 97.7% of these programs have a Department of Women’s Health Nursing with the highest rate. 98.9% of the nursing schools have vocational skills laboratories, and 55.1% of them have simulation laboratories. In nursing programs, low-reality mannequins, part-task tutorials, and augmented models have been used at the highest rate; computer-aided simulators and simulated/standard patients have been used less frequently; and virtual reality, webbased training modules, and moulage have been used the least.Conclusion: It can be said that nursing schools providing undergraduate education partially use innovative approaches in their education, and the use of these approaches needs to be improved.

Makale Başlığı: Antagonist Figure in Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar’s A Mind at Peace
Özet: The antagonistic figure makes the values represented by the protagonist visible and enables the said values to be embodied. Antagonist figures are the representatives of opposite values and the obstacles to the self-realization of the protagonist, who stand against the values represented by the protagonist and reveal the intrigue of the dramatic action in the fiction. Although Suat, who is the exact opposite of the protagonist in the novel Huzur, is discussed because of his “nihilistic” personality and his interest in Dostoyevsky's novel characters, it cannot be said that he is evaluated in the context of the dramatic action of the novel. In this study, the function of the antagonist figure in the novel and its effect on the dramatic action of the novel will be examined through Suat, who is the individual and social opposite of Mümtaz, who is the representative of certain values in the novel A Mind at Peace, and who commits suicide to prevent Mümtaz from realizing himself, and the 'value-opposite value' problematized and discussed in the A Mind at Peace. It will be read over Suat.

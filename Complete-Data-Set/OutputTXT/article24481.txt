Makale Başlığı: Case of Rhabdomyolysis in a Patient Undergoing Hemodialysis: A Possible Association with Tramadol HCl
Özet: DOI: 10.26650/cjm.2019.43.31Tramadol hydrochloride (HCl) is a syntheticanalgesic agent, which is generally safe at a low dose. Its adverse effects arereported in cases of intoxication. Here we present a 59-year-old male patientwith multiple relapsing parathyroid carcinoma-related refractory hypercalcemiaand generalized pain. Being prescribed tramadol HCl, he consumed an increaseddosage following increased pain, resulting in rhabdomyolysis, which improvedafter cessation of the drug. Nevertheless, the patient died owing to pulmonaryembolism. Rhabdomyolysis owing to tramadol HCl consumption is very rarelyreported. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered in patients consuming tramadolHCl and having generalized muscle weakness.Cite this article as: Trabulus S, ÖzbalakM, Kaya E, Apaydın T, Özkaya HM, Açbay Ö, et al.

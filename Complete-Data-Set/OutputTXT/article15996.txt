Makale Başlığı: The Evaluation of the Public Officers in the Democratic Republic of Germany After Wiedervereinigung in terms of Human Rights and the Rule of Law
Özet: One of the inevitable consequences of periods of major social transformation and political regime changes is the process of confrontation with past and the transitional justice. Therefore, one of the most important ways to confront with the past is to the remove public officials from the state who caused human rights violations during the restruction of the administrative organization. One of the most significant example of this policy is the purification process (lustration) that took place after the unification of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990. In this study, the events that led to this process, the sources of purification activities in positive law, the implementation by the administration and the evaluations of these purification activities in judicial decisions will be considered in all aspects and in the light of comparative law, it will be discussed to what extent the purification activities post-1990 in the Federal Republic of Germany are compatible with the rule of law.

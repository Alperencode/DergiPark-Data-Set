Makale Başlığı: Exploring the relationship between L2 writing self-efficacy and language proficiency level
Özet: This study aims to explore if EFL learners’ self-efficacy perceptions of their L2 writing performance vary by proficiency level. As the research design, the quantitative method was employed and a questionnaire measuring EFL learners’ L2 writing self-efficacy on a Likert scale was used as the data collection instrument. The participants were EFL students (n=47) enrolled in the preparatory program of an English-medium instruction state university in Türkiye. Data analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the participants’ proficiency level and their perceptions of L2 writing self-efficacy. The findings indicate that EFL students develop a more positive attitude towards L2 writing as they progress in language mastery and the preparatory programs appear to be feeding into the appearance of this positive perception. Nevertheless, some points among which idea production represents the biggest concern continue to be an issue deserving much attention across the levels. This finding suggests that L2 writing training should be enhanced with strategies as well as activities that can assist students in producing ideas on given topics.

Makale Başlığı: LIBERALISM AND LIBERAL TENDENCIES IN TURKISH POLITICAL LIFE
Özet: Its feature of bringing the individual to the forefront made liberalism popular in many geographies, the Ottoman and Turkey took steps in this direction. The libertarian innovations that started to be felt in the last period of the Ottoman Empire could not go far due to the excessive centralism and state-people relationship that the state inherited from the past. Although there was a shift to liberal ideas to a certain extent with the Republic, statist practices remained largely dominant in Turkey, whose industry was underdeveloped, due to reasons such as the Great Depression, the Second World War and even the Korean War. While Ronald Reagan in the USA and Margaret Thatcher in England were prominent figures in the following process, Turgut Özal came to the forefront in Turkey during this period. The liberalization wind that started with Özal has come to these days, sometimes by taking conservatism, sometimes religiosity, and sometimes traditionalism with it. Although liberalism with the Justice and Development Party showed the possibility of attain the climax, conservative and traditional character which exhibited by the party was obstructed this.

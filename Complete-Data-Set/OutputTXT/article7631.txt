Makale Başlığı: The Physicochemical Properties of Tecer Lake (Ulaş/Sivas) and Its Phytoplanktonic Communities
Özet: In this study, the physicochemical properties of the water and phytoplankton species composition of Tecer Lake were investigated. The sampling was performed at a single station, which is approximately the middle point of the lake, in monthly periods between December 2010 and December 2011 for a period of one year. A total of 63 species were identified in the lake, representing the groups of Bacillariophyta (27), Cyanobacteria (15), Chlorophyta (14), Ochrophyta (3), Cryptophyta (2) and Euglenozoa (2). The mean values of physicochemical parameters in the lake water were estimated as: water temperature; 11oC, dissolved oxygen (DO); 8 mg/l, electrical conductivity (EC); 9,68 mS/cm, turbidity; 5,42 NTU, suspended solids (SS); 28,7 mg/l, pH; 9,32, calcium; 4939 mg/l, hardness; 1460 mgCaCO3/l, total alkalinity (TA); 261 mgCaCO3/l, sulfate; 805 mg/l, silica; 0,54 mg/l, chemical oxygen demand (COD); 150 mg/l, chloride; 1255 mg/l, total phosphate (TP); 67.9 µg/l, total soluble phosphate (TSP); 48,5 µg/l, soluble reactive phosphate (SRP); 13,9 µg/l, chlorophyll-a; 1,212 µg/l, ammonium (NH4-N); 0,048 mg/l), nitrate (NO3-N); 0,1282 mg/l and nitrite (NO2-N); 0.0048 mg/l. This lake water was classified as very hard water in regard to the data of the water hardness, however it is also designated as Class I waters in terms of temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, iron and manganese values, Class II waters in terms of total phosphate and Class IV waters in terms of pH, chloride, sulfate and chemical oxygen demand according to the Water Pollution Control Regulation.

Makale Başlığı: TWO TEXTS ON THE REFLECTIONS OF OTTOMAN MODERNIZATION IDEAS IN ENGLAND
Özet: Turkish modernization is seen as a development driven by innovations in the educational and military fields. The inability of the economic and political model of the Ottoman Empire to react to the new conditions imposed by the world system, as well as the shortcomings in the military field due to the inadequacy of modern techniques, led to the emergence of a new model of society from the end of the 18th century. In addition to the emergence of the concept of nation, as a result of the change brought about by the spirit of Enlightenment of the French Revolution, the industrial revolution that began in England and the Russian pressure, which manifested itself in the military plan, were the triggers for efforts to keep up with the times in different areas. In this context, a text published in English as early as 1892 by a Turkish writer (İbrahim Hakkı Bey) and the criticism of this text by an English writer (Hyde Clarke) are important to show Turkey's efforts to prove and explain its modernization and progress. These two texts are very informative as they show the British approach to topics such as education, administration, culture, finance and even the sultanate and caliphate. In this article, we will discuss the British approach to Turkish modernization through the article "Is Turkey Progressing?" published in the British press on Ottoman and Turkish modernization efforts and the debate it has sparked.

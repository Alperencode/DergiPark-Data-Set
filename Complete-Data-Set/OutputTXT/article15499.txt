Makale Başlığı: ROW SEEDING CONFIGURATION REGULATES YIELD, QUALITY AND COMPETITION IN COMMON VETCH (Vicia sativa L.)-SUDANGRASS (Sorghum sudanense (Piper.) Stapf.) MIXTURE
Özet: Intercropping used in modern agricultural systems is designed for growing more plant species in the samefield for maximized growth parameters. This study was conducted to understand the effects of row seedingconfiguration (same, alternate and cross seeding row) and different Sudangrass ratios (25 and 50%) on yield,quality, and competitive ability of common vetch in second crop production. Among row seedingconfiguration, same row seeding maximized the aboveground biomass production but decreased belowgroundbiomass, crude protein content and NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber). Plant height, ratio, ADF (Acid DetergentFiber) content, AGRNE (Aboveground Relative Neighbor Effect), and BGRNE (Belowground RelativeNeighbor Effect) were not affected by row seeding configurations. In order to maximize the utilization fromthe row seeding configuration, the same row seeding can increase the aboveground biomass but mitigatebelowground biomass and crude protein content. The row seeding configuration may represent a potential foryield, quality, and competitive ability when sown as a mixture using 25% Sudangrass ratio.

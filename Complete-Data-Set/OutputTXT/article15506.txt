Makale Başlığı: DETERMINATION OF OIL QUALITY AND FATTY ACID COMPOSITIONS OF SOME PEANUT (Arachis hypogaea L.) GENOTYPES GROWN IN MEDITERRANEAN REGION
Özet: This study was conducted to determine the performance of fifteen peanut lines from India and four peanut varieties (NC-7, Halisbey, Sultan and BATEM-5025) registered in Turkey. The present study was carried out in Osmaniye, which is under Mediterranean climate conditions as main crop season in 2020 and 2021. The experimental design was randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The highest oil content of peanut was observed in ICGV 10193 (52.16%±0.34), followed by ICGV 10179 (51.58%±0.35) and ICGV 16013 (51.47%±0.35). However, Oleic Acid / Linoleic Acid (O/L) ratio and iodine value are both indicators of peanut shelf life and oil stability. ICGV 15074 and ICGV 16013 came to forefront with high O/L ratio (9.46±1.46, 5.44±0.61) and low iodine value (72.68±0.60, 76.41±0.69), respectively. As a result of the study, it was concluded that some Indian peanut lines, mentioned above, can be proper to include breeding program due to their higher oil and oleic acid contents.

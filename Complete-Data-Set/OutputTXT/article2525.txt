Makale Başlığı: The Effect of the Covid-19 Epidemic on Forestry Activities in the Bartın Province
Özet: This study was discussed to reveal the negative effects of the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic on forestry activities with a multidimensional approach in the province of Bartın. To this aim, the data obtained from the questionnaire study, which was applied by face-to-face interview method in the full field with the employees of Bartın and Ulus forestry enterprise directorates and Bartın Nature Conservation and National Parks Branch Directorate, were used as material. Data were analyzed and evaluated via descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, Kruskal-Wallis H test. In the study, the coronavirus exposure levels of each forestry activity and the 12 forestry activity groups created were analyzed and different groups were determined according to the answers given by the forestry organization employees to the five-point Likert scale propositions. Correlations between the views on the levels of forestry activity being affected by the Covid-19 and some personal characteristics were determined. The null hypothesis (H0), which states that the views on the effects of the coronavirus are not different according to some personal characteristics, was checked. At the end of the study, it was found that erosion control and rangeland improvement, silviculture, and wood production works with an impact score of ≤1.49 were not affected at all (0%) by the Covid-19 epidemic; the construction and maintenance of forest roads, afforestation and sapling production, forest and village relations activities, forest cadastre and non-wood forest product production with an impact score of 1.5-1.99 were negatively affected at a “very little” rate (13%); human resources management, forest protection, operating and marketing activities with an impact score of 2.0-2.49 were negatively affected at a “little” rate (25%), and nature conservation and national park activities with an impact score greater than ≥2.5 were negatively affected a “medium” level (50%). According to the findings, some suggestions were developed to reduce the effects of the Covid-19 epidemic, thus positive contributions were made to sustainable forestry and social welfare.

Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATING PRESERVICE TEACHERS’ LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES ACCORDING TO VARIOUS VARIABLES
Özet: The aims of this study are to determine how preservice teachers spend their free time, in which social and cultural activities they engage, their hobbies, the status of meaningful relationships between their leisure time activities and their undergraduate program, their needs, and to make suggestions in this regard.  Within the scope of this survey study, the leisure time activities of participating preservice teachers from a public university in İstanbul were investigated according to various variables. Among 187 senior preservice teachers from the departments of social sciences, science, special education, and Turkish education in the faculty of education, 125 preservice teachers (85 females, 40 males) were selected as participants on a voluntary basis using the convenience sampling technique. A Likert-type survey developed by the researcher was used to collect the data. The chi-square statistical test was processed to analyze the demographic data obtained. The results revealed that the preservice teachers’ leisure time activities and hobbies do not vary according to age. Similarly, no significant relationship was reported between the preservice teachers’ leisure time activities and hobbies and the educational level of their parents. The results underlined a relationship between the participants’ leisure time activities and hobbies and gender, university department, type of high school diploma obtained, the participation in the activities organized by a cultural center other than the university and the desire to pursue a graduate education.

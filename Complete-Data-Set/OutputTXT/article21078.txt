Makale Başlığı: Potential Effects of Central Bank Digital Currency in Turkey: An Assessment with SWOT Analysis
Özet: The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey announced in its press release dated September 15, 2021 that it has established a “Digital Turkish Lira Cooperation Platform” with Tübitak, Aselsan and Havelsan. In this study, the potential effects of the central bank digital currency (CBDC), which is still in the design phase, on the Turkish economy are evaluated with SWOT Analysis. The aim of the study is to identify the strengths/weaknesses of the Digital Turkish Lira in the context of data on the Turkish economy, and to discuss possible opportunities and threats to CBDC. According to the findings of the study, the “optimal” Digital Turkish Lira, in which the financial sector is included in its design, will positively affect the efficiency and security of the financial system. The weakness of the technical infrastructure and the "inadequate" transformation of the financial system, especially the TCMB, are factors that may hinder the general acceptance of the CBDC. Institutional reforms implemented with the CBDC issuance can increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy and with the expansion of financial inclusion, the TCMB can gain a competitive advantage over “private payment systems”. We advocate that the “negative attitude” of the banking sector towards the CBDC and the concerns about digital data privacy that may occur in the society are serious threats to the Digital Turkish Lira. Depending on the CBDC design and the position of the banking sector, strengths can turn into weaknesses, opportunities turn into threats. For this reason, we suggest that CBDC design works be carried out jointly with the banking sector as a policy proposal.

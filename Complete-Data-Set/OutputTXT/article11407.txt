Makale Başlığı: Web-Based Bibliometric Evaluation of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer: Analysis of Turkey Data
Özet: Aim: Prostate cancers are the second most commonly diagnosed cancers in men. The developments in robotic surgery brought along a period in which all number of articles were written. This study, we researched the field and contribution of articles written in the world and in Turkey on robot assisted radical prostatectomy with bibliometric analysis in a web-based software. Material and Methods: In our study, 1434 original articles in the world and 57 original articles in Turkey, which met the criteria, were scanned in ISI Web of Knowledge-Science (WoS) data base by using the keywords ‘robot, prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy’. The parameters, country of the article, publication year of the article, WoS category of the article, the name of the journal where the article was published, type of the article (Original), language of the article (English) and WoS index (SCI-E), were evaluated with bibliometric analysis method. Results: Analysis of countries points out that the United States of America ranked the first with 563 (39.2%) articles, while Turkey ranked in the 11th place with 57 (3.9%) articles. According to publication year, it was found that the highest number of articles published in the world was in 2020 with 173 (12.06%) articles, while it was in 2021 with 10 (17.5%) in Turkey. With respect to field categories in WoS data base, the world was found that the field of Urology-Nephrology ranked the first with 1042 (72%) articles, while similarly Urology-Nephrology ranked the first with 35 (61.4%) articles in Turkey. According to journal name, BJU International was the journal in which the highest number of articles were published in the world with 157 (10.9%), while Journal of Endourology was the journal in which the highest number of articles were published in Turkey with 10 (17.5%) articles. In the citations and H-index rates of articles by year, it was 78 in the world and 15 in Turkey which show rising curve over the last two decades.Conclusion: Current developments in robotic surgery have a significant place in world scientific publication performance. Turkey has made valuable contributions to literature since 2014 with increasing number of articles and citations.

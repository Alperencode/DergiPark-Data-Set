The data were collected using a questionnaire prepared by the researcher asking demographic information, first aid and safety information of their own fields. All mine workers participating in the study were male, the average age of the mine workers was 37.09 ± 4.35 (24-58) years, 34.4% (n = 104) were high school graduates, 92.4% (n = 279) is married. More than 50% of the workers participating in the study answered the questions about first aid and safety information of their fields. Percentages of responding correctly to the questions of survival in disaster and first aid knowledge level of those who had an occupational accident (62.36 ± 7.11) were higher than those who had no occupational accidents (60.69 ± 8.05) (p = 0.048 p <0.05). In line with the data obtained from the research; It was determined that more than half of the participants in the study had a work accident, and more than 40% of them misunderstood the practice of heart massage and artificial respiration, which are the cornerstones of first aid.When all the data collected in the study were evaluated, it was concluded that the trainings given to the mine workers were updated and these training periods were increased.

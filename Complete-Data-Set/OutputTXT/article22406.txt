Makale Başlığı: Forecasting power transformer failure using different methods: An application on a 403 MVA transformer and an economic analysis
Özet: Power transformers (PT) are one of the most important components of power systems. PTs take a major role in energy transmission and distribution processes. So continuous operation of PTs must be ensured to maintain the power systems quality and reliability. Although the organizations responsible for electricity generation, transmission and distribution have done their best to obtain continuous transformer operation, many transformer failures have been witnessed. The experiences obtained from the result of these failures are of great importance in terms of detecting and eliminating the faults that may occur in the future. In this study, a PT failure is deeply investigated from technical and economic point of views. Investigated PT has 403 MVA installed power and it is the step-up transformer of a thermal power plant. The first aim of the study is to determine the predeterminable of the failure in this PT with 403 MVA power using the effective analysis methods selected from the literature. In this context, an actual measurement values obtained from PT were evaluated using five analysis methods. The second aim of the study is to calculate the economic loss due to failure and to make some suggestions to avoid this loss. As a result of the analyzes and calculations, it was seen that the failure could be detected and prevented before occurrence by the analysis methods used in this study. In addition, some inferences and recommendations in order to prevent economic loss are summarized in the conclusion section.

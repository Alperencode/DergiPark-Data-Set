Makale Başlığı: Urban Ecological Corridor Model: The Case of Malatya
Özet: Recently, expansion in urban areas puts pressure on ecosystem processes. Ecology-based models are being developed to detect and control this pressure. From this point of view, the study aims to develop an urban ecological corridor model that will contribute to the development of land use policies that will regulate energy flow and natural species flow, reduce the urban heat island effect and increase habitat connectivity in the case of Malatya city, and will guide cities. To achieve the stated purpose, satellite images, climate data, topographic data, and demographic data sets of different scales and temporalities were associated using different remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques, and an urban ecological corridor model was created. It was determined that the ecosystem most affected by urban growth in Malatya between 1985-2021 was the agricultural ecosystem. Based on the prediction that the urban population will reach 888,784 people in 2050, it has been determined that urban areas will reach 173 km2. While the pressure on agro-ecosystems will continue to increase between the years 2021-2050, as in the 1985-2021 period, the link between ecosystems will gradually weaken. Ecological corridors will undertake various ecological functions such as energy flow, natural species flow, urban heat island effect mitigation, groundwater regime regulation, and habitat connectivity, by guiding urban sprawl among the most ecologically sensitive and largest integrated patches of agriculture and steppe ecosystems. In Malatya, 13 ecologically sensitive areas from the agricultural ecosystem and 5 from the steppe ecosystem were determined and an ecological corridor with an area of 694 km2 connecting the ecosystem spots was proposed.

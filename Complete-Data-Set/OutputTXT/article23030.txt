Makale Başlığı: THE CHALLENGE OF REALITY WITH FANTASY: ANALYSIS OF THE FILM “EYES WIDE SHUT” WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF LACANIAN PSYCHOANALYSIS
Özet: Cinema has been in contact with many different disciplines since its inception, thanks to its mixed structure, and has become a means of expression that enriches itself by feeding off this fertile atmosphere. Psychoanalysis, which is one of these disciplines, emerged simultaneously with cinema towards the end of the 19th century and in the following process, it crossed the boundaries of psychology and established inseparable ties with various branches of art. The relationship between psychoanalysis and cinema, which sees the dynamic and intricate link between the human soul and the universe as an important object of investigation, intersects at this point. Because, in addition to being two fields that support each other, both try to infiltrate the background of the seemingly haphazard content of daily life and to solve the mystery of human characters. The post-Freudian approach of Jacques Lacan, a student of Sigmund Freud in the 20th century, breathes new life into this discipline. Lacanian film reading does not focus on the characters, but on how the audience experiences the film. In this study, the movie Eyes Wide Shut, adapted to the cinema by Stanley Kubrick in 1999, is discussed through the four basic concepts of Lacanian psychoanalysis the (unconscious, repetition, transference, the other). The desire and pleasure in the establishment of the subject were tried to be illuminated with Lacanian psychoanalysis on the axis of the characters in the film; as well as the relationship between appearance and reality; The unconscious repressed symbolic meanings behind life and death, dream and waking are discussed.

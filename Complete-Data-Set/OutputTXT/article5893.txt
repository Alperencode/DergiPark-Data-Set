Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Study of Medieval Begging Monks and Wandering Dervishes
Özet: During the end of the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, there have been importanttransformations in religious and social life throughout Europe, the Middle East, and India.Apart from official religious authorities, different religious communities includingbegging monks and wandering dervishes emerged and played important roles in medievalreligious and social life. However, historians generally have dealt with this phenomenonlocally. For example, while medieval European historians have focused on beggingmonks in the Catholic World, medieval Islamic historians have worked on dervish communitiesin the Middle East. Yet, we need to analyze the religious commonalities morebroadly. Therefore, in this article, emphasizing common motives and shared trends, Iwill examine begging monks in Medieval Europe and wandering dervishes in the IslamicWorld in a comparative way. Thus, disregarding local dynamics and religious boundaries,I will highlight how religious transformations took place in Medieval Europe and theIslamic World in a similar vein.

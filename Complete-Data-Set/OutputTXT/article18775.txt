Makale Başlığı: Factors Affecting Platelet Count in Platelet-Rich Plasma
Özet: Introduction: The amount of platelet count in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is very important for the concentration of growth factors, which play a major role in the effectiveness of PRP.Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of demographic and clinical parameters on the number of platelets in PRP.Materials And Methods: The data of 50 patients who received PRP in our stem cell center were scanned retrospectively in electronic environment. Demographic and clinical parameters (age, gender, body mass index, blood group, comorbidities, hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes, alcohol and cigarette usage) of the patients were recorded.Results: The results of the correlation analysis performed to evaluate whether there was a relationship between age and BMI with regards to platelet count in PRP revealed no statistical significance (p>0.05). Analysis of Mann Whitney-U and Kruskal Wallis-H showed that there was a statistically significant difference in terms of platelet count, gender, presence of hypertension and coronary artery disease (p<0.05). It was observed that the mean platelet count of female patients was higher than that of male patients, and the presence of hypertension and coronary artery disease also caused a decrease in platelet count with a statistically significance (p<0.05).Conclusion: According to the results of this study one can conclude that gender, presence of hypertension and coronary artery disease were correlated with platelet count of PRP. Additionaly the demographic and clinical findings such as age, BMI, blood group, diabetes mellitus, smoking and alcohol consumption had no significant effect on platelet count in PRP.

Makale Başlığı: Applications of laser radiation on cotton fabrics Dyed gall oak (quercus infectoria olivier)
Özet: In this study, at different ratios mordanted with iron (II) sulfate (FeSO₄.7H₂O) and potassium aluminum sulfate [KAl(SO₄)₂12.H₂O] cotton fabrics were dyed gall oak (Quercus infectoria Olivier). Laser radiation firstly was used on raw cotton fabrics and secondly, cotton fabrics with different ratios of metallic mordanted and dyed with gall oak were irradiated to examine the laser radiation effects on textile color using several combinations of the two main laser parameters namely the number of pulses and energy density at 1064 nm. Colorimetric analysis of the cotton fabrics was measured by CIEL*a*b* spectrophotometer and examined surface alterations. Morphological analysis was performed using optical microscopy. The color coordinates and fastness values of washing rubbing, and light were investigated by comparing them with each other.

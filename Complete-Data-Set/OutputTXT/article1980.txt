Makale Başlığı: THE IMPACT OF THE MODULAR CONCRETE WALL BUILT BY TURKEY ON THE IRANIAN BORDER UNDER THE INTEGRATED BORDER MANAGEMENT MODEL ON IRREGULAR MIGRATION
Özet: The huge increase in the number of migrants in the 21st century has pushed states into a protectionist position and led them to develop new border security strategies. As a result of full membership negotiations with the EU, in 2006, within the scope of the national action plan on borders, the aim was to adapt to the EU integrated border management model. Within the scope of this target, new institutions and boards were established, and the deficiencies identified within the framework of EU membership were tried to be eliminated with certain projects. Turkey has tried to develop a new border management strategy, taking into account its harmonization process with the EU and its own security problems, and has taken important steps to increase border security in this context. The most important expectation of both the EU and Turkey in this new border security concept is; irregular migration has been prevented. In this context, Turkey has started the construction of a modular concrete wall on the Iranian border, where irregular migration crossings are most common. In this article, the effectiveness of the firewall that Turkey has built on the Iranian border as a result of its efforts to adapt to the integrated border management model will be discussed in preventing irregular migration.

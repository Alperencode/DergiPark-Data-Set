Makale Başlığı: Supervision of a wind farm connected to the grid by the electric production distribution method
Özet: Face to the growing demand in electricity, and to avoid the use of polluting fossil energies (oil and gas), several countries turned to renewable energies including wind turbine. The integration rate of wind farms into the electrical network has become increasingly significant. Consequently, several instability problems arise because, so far, they do not take part in the system services. Our study is focused on the control and management of the production of active and reactive powers of a wind farm. Indeed, this power management is guaranteed by a supervision algorithm based on proportional distribution. An analysis of the transferred powers by the wind system and an estimation of the maximum production capacity of the powers are carried out to provide the necessary information to this algorithm and to guarantee its accurate operation. A supervision algorithm was proposed for our system in order to coordinate the reactive power references distribution between the DFIG stator and the grid converter. This algorithm added reactive compensation flexibility for the wind farm by considering three operating modes. The presented simulation results validate the algorithm developed for the powers supervision of the wind farm connected to the grid during different operating modes.

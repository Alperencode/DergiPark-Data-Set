Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Organizational Cynicism on Employee Performance and Organizational Commitment in Pandemic (Covid-19) Conditions: An Application in the Health Sector
Özet: In this study, "Does the organizational cynicism perceptions of health professionals have an effect on employee performance and organizational commitment?" The answer to the question has been sought. In this context, an online questionnaire was prepared and filled by 218 health professionals who could be reached. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS 18 application. Frequency, percentage, correlation and regression analyzes were used in the analysis of the data. According to the results obtained, it was determined that the organizational commitment and organizational cynicism levels of the health workers participating in the survey were moderate, and the employee performance perception levels were high. An inverse and moderate relationship was found between organizational commitment and organizational cynicism. Again, while there were negative and moderately significant relationships between the cognitive and affective dimensions, which are the sub-dimensions of organizational cynicism, and organizational commitment, the inverse and significant relationship between the behavioral dimension and organizational commitment was found to be weak. In the regression analysis performed between organizational cynicism and organizational commitment, it was determined that there was a moderate and inverse significant relationship, as in the correlation analysis.

Makale Başlığı: Pipe Finds from Amorium City Excavations
Özet: The subject of this study is the pipe finds found in the Amorium City excavations between 1988-2009 and 2013-2022. The pipe appeared in parallel with the consumption of tobacco, which is thought to have entered Anatolia through the British since the 16th century. With the widespread use of tobacco from the 17th century onwards, the pipe production centers increased at the same rate until the beginning of the 20th century. Various forms have emerged in the pipes with the effect of the fact that the bowl production has spread over a wide geography and time period and also with the effect of local tastes. The bowls produced by pressing the mold or by processing on potter's wheels were also found in the layers associated with the Late Ottoman Period settlement in the excavations of the Amorium City, as in many ancient cities. The pipe finds found in the Amorium excavations consist of a total of 102 pieces. However, 39 pieces forming from the mentioned 102 pipe pieces were introduced in catalog. A typological grouping was made out of 23 pieces of which bowl parts were present. The pipe finds, which are considered in 6 different types, have been dated based on similar samples from Anatolia and outside Anatolia and the findings belonging to the settlement layer.

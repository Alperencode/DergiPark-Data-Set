Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the performance of some bread wheat genotypes under drought conditions by GGE Biplot Analysis Method
Özet: Today, the most important factor limiting wheat production and productivity is drought. In order to increase wheat production, it has become imperative for plant breeders to develop varieties that are suitable for the growing conditions of the region, resistant to drought, and have high adaptability. In the study, it was aimed to evaluate the agronomic performances of some bread wheat genotypes in Diyarbakır conditions and to determine the genotypes with high yield for the region by the GGE Biplot analysis method. The study was carried out under rain-fed conditions in the experiment area of the Faculty of Agriculture of Dicle University in the 2018/2019 wheat-growing season. In the study, 36 advanced bread wheat lines obtained from the International Corn and Wheat Development Center (CIMMYT) and commercial varieties Empire and Pehlivan were used. Due to the late establishment of the study, the effect of partial drought and heat stress experienced in terms of precipitation in the growing season negatively affected yield and yield items. The highest grain yield was obtained from ZT-18, ZT-19 and ZT-11 genotypes and 19 genotypes were able to exceed the average yield. According to the "which-where-won" model of the GGE biplot analysis, ZT-18 and ZT-19 genotypes were determined as the most suitable genotypes in terms of BU, BBS, BTS, BTA and TV traits since they were clustered in a single Mega Environment and a micro sector.

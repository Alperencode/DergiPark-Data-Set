Makale Başlığı: Determinants of Dynamic Capital Structure and the Speed of Adjustment to Optimal Leverage: A Study on Financial Institutions in Turkiye
Özet: This  study  examines  whether  financial  institutions  in  Turkiye  revise  target  debt  ratios  when  determining  capital  structures, in addition to investigating the speed of adjustment to  optimal  capital  structure  in  the  presence  of  adjustment  costs.  The  data  were  obtained  from  the  COMPUSTAT  Fundamentals  database,  which  is  maintained  by  Standard  &  Poor’s.  The  dataset  covers  1,570  firm-year  observations  from  114  financial institutions (deposit banks, Islamic banks, securities,  real  estate  investment  trusts,  and  insurance  companies)  between  1996  and  2018.  Using  the  dynamic  panel  data  analysis  method  GMM-SYS,  the  speed  of  adjustment  to  optimal  capital structure is determined to be 26%; however, during the global financial crisis (2007–2010), when financial institutions’ total debt ratios declined, this speed plummeted to 19%. Based on the results of the analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that financial firms conduct balancing behavior around a target debt  ratio  to  maintain  optimal  debt  ratios  when  structuring capital, rather than making a hierarchical selection  among  alternative  financing  options.  As  the study is an exploratory endeavor to determine the speed of adjustment, the factors affecting the adjustment  speed  and  the  extent  to  which  these  factors increase or decrease adjustment speeds in different periods are beyond the scope of the study. Future  research  should  consider  institutional  and  macroeconomic determinants of adjustment speed to  help  advise  firm  executives  about  the  optimal  capital structures of their respective firms.

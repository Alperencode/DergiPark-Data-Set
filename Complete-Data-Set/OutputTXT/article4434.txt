Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Ghost of Tsushima Game According to the Actantial Model of Griemas
Özet: The success of digital games is possible with a gripping story and surrealistic depictions of places and characters. When the stories of popular games in the recent past are examined, the abundance of games that deal with historical and mythological events draws attention. In this study, the structure of the plot in the Ghost of Tsushima game, developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2020, was examined according to Greimas' model of actors. The analysis of the play is based on its model, a qualitative approach traditionally developed by Greimas (1973) to examine and describe the different roles, functions, and actions in storytelling. This model presents the interconnections of the relationships, functions, and possible actions in the scenario in a table. As a result of the research, the plot in the play was defined according to the subject, object, sender, receiver, supportive and obstructive elements, which form the basis of the pragmatic narrative model and also known as the semiotic frame, and the relations between the actors and the operation scheme of the narrative were revealed.

Makale Başlığı: Reading The City and the Urban Dicotomocy Over the Concepts
Özet: It is frequently seen that the concepts of “urban” and “city” are used interchangeably in the literature on the urban,such as public administration, architecture and sociology in Turkey. The fact that there is a direct relationshipbetween the city and civilization in Islamic sources and that the phenomenon of modernity, which emerged as asocial product of the Industrial Revolution, is generally handled on the urban level, supports the view that there isa deep meaning difference between the concepts of “urban” and “city”. This study provides an original guide tothe content of the concepts in question by making a terminological analysis of the periods in which the conceptsof “urban” and “city” were used from the past to the present. In addition, It determined the trajectory of the methodof our study, where the term city representing organicity and value produced the concept of home, and the termurban representing mechanicalness and utility produced the concept of housing. In this sense, it is aimed to revealthe similar and different aspects of the use of the city and the concept of the urban in the literature, and to clarifythe terminological use border between them. In this framework, it has been concluded that the concepts of “urban”and “city” are the products of different dynamics.

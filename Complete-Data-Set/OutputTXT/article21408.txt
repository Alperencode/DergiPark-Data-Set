Makale Başlığı: Wideband patch array antenna using superstrate configuration for future 5G  Applications
Özet: In this work, four distinct antenna configurations for future-centric 5G applications are proposed. Initially,  a single rectangular patch is designed to operate at the frequency of 28 GHz while maintaining a wide operational band.  Performance of the antenna is improved by incorporating an array of identical rectangular elements resulting in a higher  gain and wider bandwidth. The proposed arrangement consists of three rectangular elements realized using 0.508-mm thick  Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 laminate. The bandwidth is further enhanced by increasing the number of radiating  elements in the array from three to five. Evolution of the proposed design is concluded by stacking the superstrate  layer above the five-element array structure, thereby improving the gain associated with the proposed configuration.  The antenna covers the frequency band from 25.1 GHz to 30.5 GHz under consideration for 5G communications. The  proposed antenna occupies a physical footprint of 3.5 × 3.5 cm$^2$. Performance of the presented antenna configurations is  analyzed using different electromagnetic descriptors including bandwidth, reflection coefficient, gain, radiation patterns,  and radiation efficiency obtained using Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio  CST MWS  software. The  measured results, obtained after fabrication and testing, demonstrate good overall agreement with the simulated outcome.  The formulated design is a prime candidate for deployment in 5G applications of the future.

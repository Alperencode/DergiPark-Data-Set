Makale Başlığı: Measuring the Impact of the Covid-19 Epidemic on the Food Industry with Data Envelopment Analysis: An Application on the XGIDA Index
Özet: A virus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, spread all over the world in a short time. This virus, which affected the whole world, was named as coronavirus and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In order to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, each country has made some social and economic restrictions within itself. In the period when environments such as cinemas, theaters and cafes where people were in mass were closed, economic problems began to emerge. In this study, it is aimed to determine the effective and ineffective ones by measuring the efficiency values of 25 companies in the XGIDA index in 2020, when the impact of the pandemic was felt intensely, with the BCC input-oriented DEA method. It has been determined at what rate ineffective companies should make changes in their inputs in order to reach effective values. Current ratio, total assets, cost of sales input variables in the analysis; net profit and sales revenue are taken as output variables. 8 of the 25 companies subject to the analysis were found to be efficient according to the BCC input-oriented DEA model. When the results are examined, it is seen that the lowest relative efficiency score is 0.73. As a result, it has been determined that efficiency is good in companies in the food sector listed on Borsa Istanbul during the pandemic period.

Makale Başlığı: Sampling Techniques and Application in Machine Learning in order to Analyse Crime Dataset
Özet: Machine learning enables machines to learn information and make inferences using the information it has learned. In this article, five years of crime data were analyzed and the learning process was completed with the data in the machine's hands. One-Hot Encoding and Min-Max Normalization methods and Principal Component Analysis algorithm were used in the analysis of the data. The model was asked to predict whether the criminal could be caught, the security of the area, and the type of crime committed using the K-Nearest Neighborhood, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms. However, no matter how successful the model is in imbalanced datasets, the result will be misleading. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to transform the imbalanced data into a balanced one by various methods and to find the most accurate sampling method for the data, which is compatible with the classification method. For this purpose, one statistical sampling method (Stratify), three over sampling method (Random Over Sampler, Synthetic Minority Over, Adaptive Synthetic), three under sampling method (Random Under Sampler, Near Miss, Neighborhood Cleaning Rule) and mix samplig method (Smote Tomek) have been applied to avoid imbalance of data in target areas such as Arrest, Crime Type,Security. As a result of the sampling methods applied, efficient and effective results were obtained.

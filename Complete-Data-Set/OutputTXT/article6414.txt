Makale Başlığı: THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN STATE BUILDING IN KOSOVO
Özet: EU countries were the most affected during the disintegration process of Yugoslavia. Therefore, the EU intervened during the Yugoslav wars and made efforts to resolve the conflicts through peaceful means. The EU, which was also involved in the Kosovo war, which is the last of the wars in the geography of the former Yugoslavia, has been active in establishing peace after the war and is trying to contribute to the state-building process in Kosovo through the EULEX mission after Kosovo's declaration of independence. EULEX, the rule of law mission of the European Union (EU), is assigned to the police and justice sector. EULEX is the second mission established by the EU in the Western Balkans. With the EUFOR mission it established, the EU carries out studies for the establishment of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this article, the role of the EU in the state-building process in Kosovo, its job description, the work it has done in Kosovo since its establishment, and the contribution of these studies to the state-building in Kosovo and whether they are successful or not are examined. In the study, first of all, the institutions and their fields of duty were examined in the state-building process in Kosovo. Secondly, the task of the EU's EULEX mission in the state-building process in Kosovo and its work are examined.

Makale Başlığı: A Story in the Grip of Poverty: On Nevzat Üstün's "Akrep Uretim Ciftligi"
Özet: Poverty, which is both the source and the result of some of the social problems, has not fallen from the agenda from the past to the present; It is a universal phenomenon based on economic, social, political and cultural grounds. Starting from the idea that poverty can be made visible through literature, many writers and poets want to draw attention to this universal issue from different perspectives. Poverty, which has emerged with a serious corpus of village literature in Turkish literature, is a subject that has not found much field of study in the literature.	Nevzat Üstün, who has been evaluated as a socialist realist writer due to his political ideas as well as the themes and approaches in his works, is among the names in Turkish storytelling after 1960. Nevzat Üstün brings up many issues such as unemployment, migration, women's and children's rights in his columns, and carries the hunger/poverty theme to his poems and stories with a critical eye. In his stories, the Superior, who works with a critical and sometimes observant attitude along with his living conditions, approaches not only the problems of his own country, but also the problems of the nations of the world with great care and seriousness. In this study, Nevzat Üstün's story "Akrep Üretim Çiftliği" which he tells the life of the people who are in poverty, will be evaluated.

Makale Başlığı: Application of Tree Seed Algorithm on Clustering Problems
Özet: Seperating gathered data into consistent subgroups is an imprtant phase to retiriewe meaningful information from data. Seperating data into groups can be performed with two different operation which are classification and clustering. While the labels of data groups and so the number of subgroups are known in classification, class labels are not known in clustering process. So, clusteing is an unsupervised machine learning operation. In clustering process, data objects are seperated into subgroups according to similarity and dissimilarity among data samples. Optimization algorithms are useful method which try to reach optimum solution among possible solutions and are used to solve nonolinear problems. Besides commonly used traditional clustering methods, optimization methods are recently applied on clustering problems because of their characteristics for reaching optimum solutions among possible solutions space. In this study a recently developed optimization algorithm called Tree Seed Algorithm is applied on 17 different clustering problems and the results are compared with the performances of traditional clustering methods like K-Means, K-Medoids and Fuzzy C-Means. It is seen that Tree Seed Algorithm has better performance than traditional methods for clustering problems.

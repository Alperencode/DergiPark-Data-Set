Makale Başlığı: Organizational Cynicism And The Age Factor As Mediators In The Relationship Between Presenteeism And Job Satisfaction
Özet: The goal of this study was to learn more about the impact of presenteeism perception on occupational health and safety experts job satisfaction, as well as the relationship between organizational cynicism and age factors that mediate or regulate this effect. Data was collected using an internet-based questionnaire from 251 occupational health and safety experts in order to examine the research problem using quantitative methods.  The least squares method was used to create two regression models. The direct effect of absenteeism perception on job satisfaction, the direct effect of organizational cynicism, and the mediation effect were investigated in the first regression model. The manager/moderator effect of the age factor on these effects was questioned in the second regression model. While not being present at work has no statistically significant effect on job satisfaction, the effect of presenteeism perception on job satisfaction is statistically significant when combined with the mediation effect of the organizational cynicism factor. As a result, organizational cynicism serves as a full mediator. Changes in two variables have a negative impact on job satisfaction levels. In this relationship pattern, the age factor has a significant executive effect. However, the managerial effect of age is only significant on the organizational cynicism factor and its mediating effect, not on the effect of presenteeism level alone. The impact of presenteeism on job satisfaction through cynicism tends to increase as people get older.

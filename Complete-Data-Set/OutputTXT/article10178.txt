Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF ÇAYKUR’S TRANSFER TO TURKISH WEALTH FUND AND FINANCE PROBLEM
Özet: Recently, different state economic enterprises have been transferred to the Turkish Wealth Fund in Turkey. ÇAYKUR is one of the enterprises that are subject to the transfer process. However, the transfer of state economic enterprises to wealth funds is controversial. For this reason, considering the purpose of establishing wealth funds and the nature of the companies in the fund in the international literature, it has been analysed whether state economic enterprises are suitable for the structure of wealth funds. Afterward, the compatibility of the transfer procedures with the national legislation was also discussed. In addition to these, the focus of the study was the financing problem of ÇAYKUR. Because the bank loan debts, which increase every year, have reached severe levels in recent years. In this respect, the reasons for the financing problem have been tried to be revealed by considering the financial statement data of the enterprise. Thus, attention was drawn to the measures that could be taken for a sustainable business structure. As a result, in the study, a financial analysis was made with data analysis and the legal assessment of the status of ÇAYKUR.

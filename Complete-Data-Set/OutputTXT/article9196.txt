Makale Başlığı: A New Iterative Scheme for Approximating Fixed Points of Suzuki Generalized Multivalued Nonexpansive Mappings
Özet: In this paper, we study to approximate fixed points of Suzuki generalized multivalued nonexpansive mappings by using a three-step iterative scheme (1.1) introduced in [17]. We establish some weak and strong convergence results for mappings satisfying condition (C) with the newly proposed iterative scheme in the framework of uniformly convex real Banach spaces.

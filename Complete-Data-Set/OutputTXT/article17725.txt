Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF JOB APPLICATIONS WITH MACHINE LEARNING METHODS
Özet: The most significant asset for an institution or business is its manpower. For the manpower tobe strong, the right staff should be hired first. Today, staff requirements, candidate qualifications andthe number of job applications have increased. This situation made the process of identifiying the rightcandidate more complex and difficult by increasing the amount of data to be analyzed to very highdimensions. The recruitment decision is a critical decision which is hard to reverse and has long-termconsequences. This critical decision has to be made by a limited number of staff who have to followmany different tasks at the same time. Artificial intelligence is the primary technology that can help newstaff selection, thanks to its ability to provide meaningful outputs by examining large-scale data. Withinthe scope of this study, in order to reduce the problems in recruitment process and to reach the rightcandidate in a shorter time, an application which can pre-eliminate by evaluating application forms withmachine learning algorithms has been developed. With the application, recruitment teams will be ableto perform the evaluation processes which can normally take days or weeks in a short time. It has beenobserved that machine learning algorithms trained with the evaluations made in the past can makepredictions with high accuracy on new job applications.

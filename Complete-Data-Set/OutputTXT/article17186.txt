Makale Başlığı: SIGNING AVAL THROUGH A REPRESENTATIVE
Özet: Although there is no clear article in the TCC about the signing aval through a representative, essentially it is evaluated based on the fact that it is an exchange commitment feature. In this respect, authorities of commercial representative and commercial agent’s on the issue of signing aval become different. In our study, first of all, the basic terms (essentia negotii) that should be included in the aval through the representative have been tried to explain. We have tried to support these statements with some guiding judical decisions that we have established. Meanwhile some of these judical decisions have been criticized because of the way they handled the subject. A balance have been tried to be established between freedom of contract and ensuring that the represented person is not exploited on the issue of signing aval in favor of the representative himself/herself.

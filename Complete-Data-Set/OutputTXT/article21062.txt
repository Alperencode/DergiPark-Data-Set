Özet: Hugh IIof Lusignan, the fifth king of the Kingdom of Cyprus, was still a baby when he ascended the throne in 1253. Therefore, his mother, Plaisance of Antioch, became his regent. Queen Plaisance of Antioch served as the regent of both the Cyprus and Jerusalem Kingdoms, and after the death of the Queen, the question of who would be the regent among the Lusignansarose. In the study, the issue of who came to the regency is examined in detail. The struggle between Hugh of Antioch and Hugh of Brienne, cousins of King Hugh II of Lusignan for the regency, ended in favor of Hugh of Antioch. In 1267, King Hugh II of Lusignan died and left no heirs. The person who succeeded him was the regent Hugh of Antioch, so the Kingdom of Cyprus continued from Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan, the son of Isabella of Lusignan who was daughter of Hugh I of Lusignan. Then, Melisende of Lusignan's daughter Marie made a claim for the throne, but no avail. Marie applied to Pope Gregorius X, sold her rights to Charles of Anjou.

Makale Başlığı: EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF THE AGE OF STARTING PRIMARY SCHOOL ON THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: A MIXED METHOD STUDY
Özet: The main purpose of this study is to examine the 'effect of the age of starting primary school on academic success'. In this design, qualitative and quantitative data were collected at the same time and analyzed separately, and a holistic evaluation was made by integrating them into the conclusion part. The study is discussed in two ways. First, what are the opinions of classroom teachers regarding the effect of school starting age on academic success? Secondly, what is the statistically significant relationship between the students' mean scores and the school starting age? In this research designed as a mixed method study, triangulation design was used.  Qualitative data were obtained from the opinions of 117 teachers working in the city center of Tokat. Quantitative data consists of age and grade information of 1792 students who continue to 7th grade in Tokat city center. The qualitative data of the research were analyzed by converting them into codes and categories with the help of NVİVO program. Quantitative data were edited and analyzed using the SPSS program. Qualitative and quantitative findings analyzed separately were explained by integrating in the conclusion part of the research. Both qualitative and quantitative results of the study show that students starting school early in Turkey are less academically successful. Teachers' opinions also support the academic failures of students who start school at a younger age.

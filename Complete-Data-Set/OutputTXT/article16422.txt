Makale Başlığı: Determination of Some Physicochemical Properties of Honeys from Tokat Region and Their Compliance with the Turkish Food Codex
Özet: In this study; some physical and chemical properties of honey taken from the districts of Tokat province, where plant diversity is quite high, were determined. Results of some physicochemical, pesticide, and mineral analyses conducted with Turkish Standards (TS) 3036 Honey Standard and internationally accepted analysis methods of flower honey samples (24 in total) obtained from 12 districts in 2019 and 2020 Turkish Food Codex (TGK) Honey Communiqué (2020/7) has been investigated for compliance. Moisture content in honey samples is 13.0-20%; total acidity 26±0.12-48±0.16 meq/kg; electrical conductivity 0.33-0.86 mS/cm; the amount of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) 0.05-8.69 mg/kg; proline value 422.56-1222.56 mg/kg; diastase number 0.0-10.9; protein and raw honey Δ13 C difference -0.84-1.23; C4 sugar content 0.0-5.26%; amount of sucrose 0.30-1.96%; fructose+glucose amount 62.54-76.67%; fructose/glucose ratio was determined as 0.98-2.62. Pesticides were detected in a total of three samples in honey samples. These are triamenol+triadimefon, metrafenone, cypermethrin, boscalid, deltamethrin, and kresoxim methyl. In three samples, the limit values are exceeded, and in the other samples, the limit values are in the range. Mineral content of honey (in mg/kg); zinc (Zn) 0.0-24.306; nickel (Ni) 0.0-2.906; chromium (Cr) 0.0-3.850; manganese (Mn) 0.0-4.660; copper (Cu) 0.0-17.099; lead (Pb) content was determined in the range of 0.314-2.729. The total phenolic content of the samples was 254.14-776.94 µg GAE/g honey; free radical scavenging activity was 129.47-587.37 µg TE/g honey; cation radical scavenging activity was in the range of 93.33-1187.78 µg TE/g honey.

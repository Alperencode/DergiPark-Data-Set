Makale Başlığı: Analysis Of The Educational Environments Of Konya Science Center In The Context Of Space And Technology
Özet: Recently, informal education environments that support existing schools have been created due to changing educational needs. Science Centers, which are one of the informal education environments, have also started to become widespread in our country in recent years and all this has brought about the design problem of these buildings.  The aim of the study is to reveal how the interiors of science centers should be constructed within the context of the relationship between space and technology. As a result, while the study is expected to guide the interior architects for the science center designs, the exhibition areas should be highlighted as the focus point as an educational area. In addition, interactive exhibition dec dec which can be tried by touching and playing between space and technology themed exhibition areas in science centers for students are among the places that make the greatest contribution in terms of informal education. In this direction, the educational units of Konya Science Center are examined.

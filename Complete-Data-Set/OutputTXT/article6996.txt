Makale Başlığı: Phenotypic Correlations between Carcass Part Yields and Meat Quality Characteristics in Quails
Özet: Objective: This study aimed to determine phenotypic correlations between carcass part yields (breast and thigh yield) and meat quality characteristics (pHu, lightness, redness, yellowness, chroma, hue, thawing loss, cooking loss, water holding capacity, and texture) in Japanese quails.Material and Methods: This study was carried out on a total of 130 Japanese quails with mixed sexes. Twenty-four hours after slaughter, pHu and color measurements were performed in the right breast muscle to determine meat quality characteristics.Results: Mean breast and thigh muscle yields were determined as 24.19% and 14.41%, respectively. Significant phenotypic correlations were found for carcass part yields and meat quality characteristics in quail meat. While determined negative significant (p<0.05) phenotypic correlations for pHu and lightness (-0.193), yellowness (-0.288), chroma (-0.266), and thawing loss (-0.248); pHu’s relationships with redness, hue, water holding capacity and, texture were insignificant.Conclusion: In this study, the significant negative phenotypic correlation determined between pHu and lightness shows that selection for breast meat lightness in quails can affect the ultimate pH and lead to an improvement in quality characteristics, and this situation can be used to reduce meat quality defects.

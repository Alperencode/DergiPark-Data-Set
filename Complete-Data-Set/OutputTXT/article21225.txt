Makale Başlığı: Healthful Behaviour during the Pandemic: Physical Distancing
Özet: The purpose of this naturalistic observation study was to observe, in a natural setting, the actions of shoppers at retail outlets. In doing so it was hoped that numerous behaviors could be observed that would indicate a level or extent of observance of physical distancing guidelines. It was found that the observed sample was often in compliance with physical distancing guidelines and avoiding contact with others while shopping in retail contexts. The wearing of masks was noted and the cleaning of hands upon entry and exiting was commonplace. Overall, the sample demonstrated an informed and obedient behavioural mode observing the advice from various levels of government.

Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF INTERCULTURAL COMPETENCIES OF SPA EMPLOYEES IN THE SCOPE OF CONTACT HYPOTHESIS
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine the opinions of SPA employees working in four and five star hotels operating in Çanakkale with a scale created on intercultural competence and social contact. Within the scope of the study, semi-structured interview technique was preferred as the primary data collection technique, one of the qualitative research methods. Study data were collected by face-to-face interviews with SPA employees in April 2022. The interviews with the participants were held between 15-20 minutes and the note-taking technique was preferred. The semi-structured interview form, which was created to collect data, consists of three parts. In the first part, demographic questions for the participants; in the second part, intercultural competence; in the third part, there are questions to determine contact situations. The questions asked to the participants within the scope of the study were formed under the dimensions of “Intercultural Competence Level” and “Contact Hypothesis”. It is seen that the participants generally gave positive answers to the questions in both dimensions. As the difficulties, they experienced in the process of adapting to Turkish culture, the issue of communication and neighborly relations were expressed, as the spices used in our country are difficult to find due to the difference in culinary cultures in general.

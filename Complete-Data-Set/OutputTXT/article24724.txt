Makale Başlığı: The Methods of Coping with the Stress Among Medical Faculty Students and the Relationship between Sociodemographic Characteristics and these Methods
Özet: Objective: Aim of the study is to examine the methods of coping with the stress among the 1st , 3rd and 6th year medical faculty students at Pamukkale University and to examine the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and these methods.  Material and Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the 1st , 3rd and 6th year medical faculty students at Pamukkale University in June 2012. Folkman and Lazarus' &#8216;Ways of Coping Scale' was applied to participants.  Results: The mean age of the students was 21.9± 2.7 and 55.2% were female. 42.7% of students were in the 1st, 42.7% in the 3rd, and 14.6% in the 6th grade. The method of &#8216;Self Confident Coping' was higher in men (19.9±4.2) than women (18.3±3.3) (p = 0.005). The method of &#8216;Optimistic' was higher in men (13.4±2.5) than women (12,3±2.2) (p=0.005). Multivariate analyzes showed that men (p=0.006) and older age groups (p=0.026) used &#8216;Problem-focused/Active' style of coping with stress, participants in the 1st and 3rd class (p=0.01) and (p=0.03) more frequently used &#8216;Emotion-focused/Passive' style of coping with stress.  Conclusion: Medical students are mostly using the method of &#8216;Self Confident Coping' and infrequently using the method of &#8216;Seeking of Social Support'. Men and older ones mainly use &#8216;Problem-focused/Active' style of coping. Health services for medical students to provide support about coping with the stress need to be activated and the results of this study and similar studies need to be used to improve the quality of services for students.

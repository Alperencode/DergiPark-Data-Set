Makale Başlığı: An Approach to Housing Problem from the Past: Local Governments and Housing Provision
Özet: The right to the city is a socio-spatial right for all in terms of social, spatial, and economic aspects, including all components in the city. The right to shelter, one of the most critical components, must be provided inclusively and unconditionally, as promised in international documents and The Constitution. Housing provision as the subject of urban speculation is a multi-actor and multi-component instrument of the right to housing. Centralization in housing provision can sometimes lead to results that diverge from the demands and needs of the locality. On the other hand, local governments, which represent public will and stand as an administrative unit closest to local community, do not play an active role in housing supply by only being a facilitator of housing supply. Taking the authority and responsibility by local governments for housing supply and existence of housing supply methods to achieve this is quite significant to preserve public interest for locality. The main aim in this research is to demonstrate the positive effects of the intervention of local governments in housing policies to cope with the problems which are existing housing supply in Turkey -not compatible with the characteristics of localities- and income inequalities depending on speculation.

Makale Başlığı: Generalized Procrustes Analysis Method: An Application on Sensory Data
Özet: In this study, it was aimed at the evaluation of the relationships between lambs sensory properties and meat samples using with Genaralized Procructes Analysis (GPA). In sensory analysis, the characteristics of juiciness, flavor, odour, tenderness and overall liking of the meat samples were evaluated by hedonic scale ranging from 1-9 by 41 semi-trained panelists. Accordingly, the first two factors obtained from the GPA analysis explained approximately 76.74% of the variability between the sensory properties of the meat samples. The tenderness, juiciness and overall liking characteristics played an important role in the formation of the first factor which has the most contributed (40.72%) to the explaining of the total variation. Residuals of the meat samples were generally found close to each other. At the same time, the consensus configuration map obtained from the GPA of the meat samples has clearly distinguished by the panelists. However, the majority of panellists have provided a consensus between the meat samples in terms of sensory properties. As a result, GPA method provides an effective and alternative solution for the examine of the panel behavior and reducing the variability between panelists who are involved in the sensory analysis.

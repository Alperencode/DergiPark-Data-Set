Makale Başlığı: THE FIRST NOTATION FOLK INSTRUMENTS ORCHESTRA IN AZERBAYJAN
Özet: Azerbaijani music culture, which is one of the branches of Turkish culture, has a unique and ancient history. In addition to the traditional types of Azerbaijani music such as mugham - maqam, ashiqs, folk music, religious music, there are also many stringed, wind and percussion instruments with high performance art and great technical possibilities.The meeting of the performing art- which was made with the “meşk” (model teaching –practice teaching) system based on the master-apprentice relationship, and which has become a tradition for centuries- with the notation system emerged on different dates in each country. The notation system which is currently used in Azerbaijani dates back to the years of 1816-1818 (Abbasova E. Gasımov K. - 1970). Before those years, the notation symbols which were different from the current notation system had been used in many countries as in Azerbaijani. In this study, it is aimed to examine the technical features of the Azerbaijani folk instruments in the orchestra by revealing the formation, historical development and current situation of the first folk instrument orchestra connected to the notation system in Azerbaijan.

Makale Başlığı: Analysis of the Efficiency of a 4-Point Fabric Inspection System that is Used before Cutting to Reduce Fabric-Related Defects in Garment Manufacturing
Özet: Fabric costs are in the first place among cost items in garment manufacturing. Of course, a significant part of these costs consists of fabric-related second quality costs. This study aims to identify fabric-related defects at a facility that manufactures garments and reveal the efficiency of a 4-Point Fabric Inspection System (4P-FIS) that aims to minimize potential losses by the identification of fabric-related defects before the cutting process of the fabric. For this purpose, data were collected through the classification department of a facility that manufactures trousers from woven fabrics that is placed after the cutting department and functions as an additional inspection unit. Accordingly, the cutting department of the studied facility was monitored for 10 days, and the numbers of defects in each defect class were determined by inspecting the cut pieces in the classification process. In the second 10-day period, the necessary inspections were made based on 4P-FIS while the fabrics were still in storage, and the numbers of defects in each defect class were determined. The SPSS Version 22 program was used to analyze the data. The data were subjected to One-way analysis of variance (Oneway Anova), Duncan’s test, correlation analysis and paired-samples t-test to determine the efficiency of the system. According to the statistical analysis results, the proposed 4P-FIS reduced the number of products with fabric-related defects by 90%, and the labor costs caused by the repair of defects decreased by a mean rate of 89.68%.

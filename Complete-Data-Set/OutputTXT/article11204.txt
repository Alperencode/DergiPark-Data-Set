Makale Başlığı: Mapping and Recording of Ancient Shipwrecks by Using Marine Remote Sensing Techniques: Case Studies From Turkish Coasts
Özet: Within the context of the “Shipwreck Inventory Project of Turkey (SHIPT),” numerous acoustic remote sensing and photogrammetric surveys have been carried out along the coast of Turkey with the aim of detecting, mapping and documenting underwater cultural heritage. During the surveys, many ancient shipwreck sites have been discovered thanks to advanced technologies such as high-resolution side-scan sonar (SSS), sub-bottom profiler (SBP), and remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Once acoustic anomalies have been located, shipwreck sites have been verified by ROV and documented by 3D photogrammetric survey. Analysis of the collected data confirmed that the survey design and data acquisition parameters are the most important criteria for obtaining best quality image. Performing high-resolution remote sensing and photogrammetric survey for shipwrecks using optimal data collection techniques provides rapid results, decreasing time and budget and increasing the quantity of underwater cultural heritage that can be recorded. This paper discusses proper survey stages for the rapid, effective, high quality detection and recording of the shipwrecks using advanced technology. Acoustic images of shipwrecks comparing cargo, period, and form are also introduced in this paper, for the first time, which provide data on interpreting anomalies accurately for further exploration and monitoring surveys.

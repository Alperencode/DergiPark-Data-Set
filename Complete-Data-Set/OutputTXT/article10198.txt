Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Mechanical Alloying Time on the Hardness and Electrical Conductivity Properties of Cu-Cr Alloys Produced by Hot Pressing Method
Özet: This study concentrated on alloying 0.5% chromium reinforced copper particles by weight by mechanical alloying method accordingto different alloying times and intensifying the produced powders by hot press method. 10:1 ball:powder ratio and 400 rpm rotationspeed were selected as mechanical alloying parameters and the times were determined as 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hours as variable. Hotpressing parameters were used as constant in all experiments and were determined as 500 ⁰C and 600 MPa. As a result of theexperiments, it was determined that the powders with initially spherical and irregular morphology had a flake-like morphology after0.5 hours of mechanical alloying. In addition, as a result of the experiments, the highest specific surface area was obtained after 1 hourof mechanical alloying and was measured as 0.0667 m2/g. The lowest and highest hardness values of the compact samples producedwithin the scope of this study belong to the samples that were not mechanically alloyed and subjected to 1 hour mechanical alloying,respectively, and were measured as 71.97 HB and 99.12 HB. The highest electrical conductivity value belongs to the sample subjectedto mechanical alloying process for 4 hours and it was measured as 91.27% IACS. In this study, the effects of time, which is one of themechanical alloying process parameters, on the morphology and size of the particles, the microstructure and physical and mechanicalproperties of the compact material were determined.

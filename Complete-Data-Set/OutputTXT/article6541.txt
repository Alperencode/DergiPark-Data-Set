Makale Başlığı: Chemical Risk Factors in Work Safety and Security: Carbon Monoxide (CO) Exposition of Workers
Özet: Chemical hazards are at the forefront of the sources of danger that adversely affect the health and safety of employees in working environments. Gaseous chemicals, which are classified as simple asphyxiant, irritant and chemical asphyxiant, carry serious risks for the working environment.In this study, it is aimed to determine the carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels of gasoline distributors, taxi-bus drivers and automotive industry workers in Gümüşhane province, which are exposed to exhaust gases, and to propose occupational health and safety (OHS) measures for them to work in a healthy and safe environment.In the study, blood samples were taken from the workers who were exposed to CO due to their profession and from the control group who were not exposed to CO, and their COHb saturation percentages were determined by the CO-Oximetry device. An 11-question semi-structured questionnaire was applied to determine the relationships between COHb levels, smoking habits, professional experience, and whether or not they received OHS training, and the results were evaluated with the SPSS program.As a result of the study, significant differences were revealed between the COHb levels of those exposed to exhaust gas and the control group. When variables such as %COHb levels and the professional experience of the employees, whether they have received OHS training or not, are examined, it is seen that these variables do not affect the result.

Makale Başlığı: Determination of Germinating Properties of Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) Lines at Low Temperatures
Özet: With this study, the germination rates of pumpkin seeds in our region, the moisture content of the seeds and the protein, sugar and oil content of the seeds were investigated. Considering the ecological conditions of the region, germination and poor germination and emergence occur due to low soil and air temperature, especially when sowing pumpkin seeds in spring at the end of April- beginning of May in Central Anatolia conditions. The aims of this study were to investigate germination-emergence  rates, germination index, protein and oil contents of in 15 pumpkin lines collected from Develi and Tomarza districts of Kayseri and inbred up to S5 and S6 levels at 12 and 15°C. The germination performances of the lines under two different temperatures were found to be 86 - 100% at 15°C and 55 - 100% at 12°C. The protein content of the seeds varied between %18.76 - 29.48 and the oil content between %30.85 - 45.93. Relationship between germination and seed oil, protein and levels were also investigated. Looking at the results of low temperature germination tests, it was determined that the protein and oil content of the seeds had a significant effect on seed strength. As a result, it was determined that there are differences among the lines compared under two different temperatures among the parameters examined. This situation should be taken into consideration by breeders. calculated,

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Adult Literacy Courses and Turkish Language Trainings for Syrian Refugees
Özet: AbstractSince 2011, approximately four million Syrians have sought refuge in Turkey due to their safety. Temporary protection status has been given to Syrians admitted to Turkey with an open door policy. In this study, literacy courses and Turkish language education for Syrian adults between the years 2011-2020 were examined using the data of the Ministry of National Education Strategy Development Directorate. The course participation data were examined within the scope of the study, which drew attention to the importance and necessity of these trainings for the social cohesion of adult Syrians. In the study, in which the qualitative research method was used, the data were collected through document analysis. Quantitative data were interpreted by transforming them into tables. Within the scope of the research, it has been found that literacy and Turkish language education for adult Syrian individuals is not at the desired level. It has been stated that 22.16% of the total adult Syrian population attended literacy and language training courses in public education centers in 2020, and this rate is also quite low. A decrease was observed in the course success rates of female participants, and it was stated that determining the course participation barriers would contribute positively to the process. It has been suggested that in order to carry out social cohesion studies in a more qualified manner, the rate of course participation should be increased, and especially the literacy course programs should be updated in a way that facilitates teaching literacy to foreigners.

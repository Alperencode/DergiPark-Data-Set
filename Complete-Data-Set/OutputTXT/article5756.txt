Makale Başlığı: ASSESSMENT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS’ ONLINE SPECIFIC EPISTEMOLOGICAL BELIEFS
Özet: The purpose of this study is to develop a domain-specific scale that would be used to determine epistemological beliefs of university students towards online learning media. In the developed scale epistemological beliefs are designed as multidimensional to reflect both belief system perspective and developmental perspectives as revised by Hofer and Pintrich (1997). 1058 volunteer students that attended remote classes during the Covid-19 pandemic participated in the study and answered scale items. In this scope as a result of exploratory factor analysis, factor structure of the 15-item scale came forward as 2-dimensional, namely Nature of Knowing and Nature of Knowledge dimensions. It was noted that load distribution factor of scale items varied between 0.40 and 0.74. Cronbach Alfa coefficient calculated for scale reliability was found to be 0.80 for each dimension. Also, it was established that this two-factor structure explained 39.44% of total variance. It is considered that the sample of the study has a rich cultural diversity and acts as a bridge between the Asian and European continents adding an intercultural structure to the scale. Thus, it is believed that deductions and comments made with the 2-dimensional, 15-item “Online-Specific Epistemological Beliefs” scale would be valid and reliable.

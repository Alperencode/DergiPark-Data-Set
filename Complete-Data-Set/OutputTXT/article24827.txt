Makale Başlığı: Using the SAMR Model for Evaluating Technology-aided Mathematics Activities
Özet: DOI: 10.5152/hayef.2019.19017With the help of technologicaldevelopments, the knowledge and skills that students need to acquire constantlyevolve, and evaluation instruments and approaches accordingly change. In thiscontext, it is necessary to assess and evaluate at what level thetechnology-aided activities allow for the development of such knowledge andskills. SAMR model is one of the approaches that allow this evaluation. TheSAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition) model is afour-step approach to the selection, use, and evaluation of technology ineducation. The purpose of this study is to examine the process of assessingtechnology-aided activities developed by mathematics educators and itsreflections on teaching according to the SAMR model. The study utilizing thecase study method received the opinions of the faculty members with writtenassessments and semi-structured interviews. In this study, content analysis wascarried out. It is thought that this study will provide an insight into thefuture studies in terms of exemplifying the evaluation of the integration oftechnology into education with the SAMR model and addressing it for the21st-century learners within the context of technological competences.Cite this article as: Aydoğan Yenmez, A.,Gökçe, S.

Makale Başlığı: Determınatıon of Relatıve Feed Value, Energy and Nutrıent Contents of Annual Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the effect of the number of harvests on the feed value of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). The annual ryegrass grown in a private family farm in Hürrempalangası Village, Erzincan was used as the research material. The ryegrass was harvested twice in the experimental period. After the plants were harvested in the flowering period and baled, samples were collected using a drill and probe. The samples were analyzed according to the harvest time in terms of chemical content, metabolizable energy (ME), net energy lactation (NEL), total digestible nutrients (TDN), and relative feed value (RFV). The obtained data were subjected to analysis of variance, and the differences between the means were determined by Duncan multiple comparison tests. The difference between the plants harvested in different periods was statistically significant in terms of nutrient contents (p<0.05). The NEL, ME, and TDN contents were calculated using the nutrient composition of the ryegrass. The difference between the harvests in terms of TDN and RFV was significant (p<0.01). The mean CP, RFV, NEL, ME, and TDN contents of the annual ryegrass were found to be 12.74% and 18.72%, 111. 56 and 98.79, 1593.9 and 1589.4 Kcal/kg DM, 2352.2 and 2345.5 Kcal/kg DM, and 59.19% and 57.02% in the first and second harvest, respectively. In conclusion, considering the climate of Erzincan, chemical composition and RFV parameters of the annual ryegrass, it can be asserted that the annual ryegrass has a high potential for a forage source and may be used in ruminant rations.

Makale Başlığı: Monkeypox: Past to Present
Özet: Monkey pox, a zoonotic disease belonging to the Poxviridae family, was isolated from monkeys in 1958. It causes clinical findings similar to smallpox in humans. Transmission is typical through the bite of an infected animal, contact with bodily fluids and droplets. Since 2003, it caused epidemics in many countries, especially in import and tourism-based travel. In the epidemic in 2022, transmission is thought to be related to sexual activity. Individuals who are not immunized with smallpox vaccine constitute the risk group for the disease. The average incubation period is considered to be 6-13 days. The presence of fever, lymphadenopathy and myalgia are different from other diseases with rash. It is essential to confirm the differential diagnosis by sending the samples to the reference laboratory. Local public health authorities should be informed about suspected cases. Supportive treatment is essential. Antiviral treatments such as tecovirimate, brincidofovir or cidofovir may be used for specific patient groups with the approval of public health authorities. In any case considered as a differential diagnosis, contact, droplet and respiratory isolation precautions should also be applied until the diagnosis is excluded. Smallpox vaccine can be administered for pre/post-exposure prophylaxis, again with the approval of local public health authorities.

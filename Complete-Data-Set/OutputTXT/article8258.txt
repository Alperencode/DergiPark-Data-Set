Makale Başlığı: MOSAIC REMAINS AS AN ART PRACTICE IN MALATYA REGION
Özet: Mosaic art, which dates back to ancient times as an application technique, can be defined as a decoration created by applying various materials such as stone, ceramic, glass and wood to a surface according to the determined shape. We see that mosaic art, which we encounter mostly as a floor or wall application depending on the architecture, is applied in different techniques depending on the material.In this study, the mosaics found in the Malatya region were investigated and the application techniques and the variety of patterns used on their surfaces were examined. It is seen that the mosaics found in the region belong to the Roman period and the Seljuk period, and these mosaics were processed in stone mosaic and ceramic mosaic techniques, and mainly geometric and figurative forms were used as motifs.

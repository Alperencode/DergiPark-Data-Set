Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Efficacy of Posterior Approach Quadratus Lumborum Block for Postoperative Analgesia after Lumbar Discectomy Surgery; Retrospective Observational Study
Özet: Lumbar disc hernia is one of the most common diseases among intervertebral disc pathologies. Lumbar discectomy surgery is, therefore, one of the leading neurosurgery interventions. Opioids are frequently used in the postoperative pain management of these patients. However, to avoid side effects of these drugs, current block techniques are frequently used today. Quadratus lumborum block (QLB)  is one of the promising blocks in this context. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy and safety of QLB performed under ultrasound guidance in single-level lumbar discectomy surgery. Bilateral QLB applied, 20 patients were included in the study as the block group, and 25 patients who were not applied were included in the study as the control group. Patients were evaluated in pain scores and postoperative intravenous opioid consumption at 2-6-12-24 hours postoperatively. Pain scores were significantly lower in the QLB group in all time periods (p0.05). Opioid consumption at the 2nd and 6th hours after the operation was significantly lower in the block group than in the control group (p= 0.004 and p= 0.011, respectively). The results of our study showed that bilateral QLB can be used as a successful option in the management of analgesia after lumbar discectomy.

Makale Başlığı: A HOME INDUSTRY BASED ON WOMEN'S LABOR: HAND KNITTING
Özet: Historically, production of textile products has been a woman’s practice since early times. Among these, hand knitting, which is dominated by women at all stages of the production process, is a globally accepted field with the expression “women’s work” in the social framework. Hand knitting, a portable act that can be done with portable tools, is a collective cultural act that is passed down from generation to generation. It has become one of the tangible legacies that make up the visual traditions and the world of myth in societies, and has been integrated into the ready-made clothing industry over time. By continuing to provide public supplies, it created an identity based on economic relations, and this identity was shaped around women's labor. On the other hand, hand-knitted products have been a production activity carried out by domestic women with the main motivation of reducing the clothing expenses of the household. As a result, it has acquired various social definitions such as outdated, needy, rural, and poor. The expressions about hand-knitted clothing that are rooted in the collective memory and the image of the domestic woman, which has taken a place in the collective consciousness about hand-knitting, are obsolete by the new discourses about knitting. In the research, the ownership of women-centered experiences accumulated for thousands of years in hand knitting, which has a unique value as it is based on domestic production, and women's labor and social identifications that bring hand knitting to the present day have been examined.

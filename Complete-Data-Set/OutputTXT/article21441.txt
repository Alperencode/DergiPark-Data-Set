Makale Başlığı: On ternary Diophantine equations of signature $ p,p,2 $ over number fields
Özet: Let $K$ be a totally real number field with narrow class number one and $O_K$ be its ring of integers.  We prove that there is a constant $B_K$ depending only on $K$ such that for any prime exponent $p>B_K$ the Fermat type equation $x^p+y^p=z^2$ with $x,y,z\in  O_K$ does not have certain type of solutions.  Our main tools in the proof are modularity, level lowering, and image of inertia comparisons.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Theses Published Between 2005-2020 on Teaching the Nature of Science in Turkey
Özet: The aim of this study is to analyze the theses on teaching of the nature of science in Turkey and to present these studies as a whole. In the study, in which the document analysis method was used, 124 theses published between 2005-2020 were examined. Theses were analyzed in terms of "the type and year of the thesis, university and province where the study was conducted, the research method (study group, data collection tool, and analysis methods), the distribution of theses according to courses/subject areas, the approaches used in teaching the nature of science and its effects, and suggestions". As a result of the analysis, it was seen that the number of master's theses was high, the publications were mostly made in 2019, and the studies were mostly carried out in certain provinces and universities. It was found that the studies focused on secondary school students and teacher candidates, quantitative research methods were used the most, data were collected mainly through scale/survey/test, and most of them were foreign-sourced, t-test/descriptive statistics/content analysis/descriptive analysis was frequently used as the data analysis method. When the distribution of theses to courses/subject areas were examined, it was determined that some courses/subject areas were focused on, explicit-reflective approach and implicit approach were mostly used in teaching the nature of science, and the results of the studies were not entirely consistent. It was seen that the thesis authors made some suggestions for "Ministry of National Education [MoNE], teachers, Higher Education Institution [HEI], academicians and researchers", and most suggestions were made for researchers and MoNE. As a result of the analysis of the theses, deficiencies or less studied areas in the literature were determined, and suggestions were made in this direction.

Makale Başlığı: Awareness of Pre-Service Teacher on Digital Eye – Strain
Özet: Eye defects are the most common health problems for school-age children. Eye defects affect not only the health but also the academic success of the student. Spending too much time with tablets and computers is leading to a deterioration in vision. It seems possible to take prevention with early diagnosis of the symptoms of eye problems. Pre-service teachers might be aware of the symptoms of eye problems and take the necessary precautions with early diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the awareness of pre-service teachers about digital eye-strain symptoms. Participants are twelve pre-service teachers studying at ESOGU Education Faculty in the fall semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. Phenomenological design was used in the study. According to the results of the study the pre-service teachers stated the general eye defect symptoms, listed the possible negative effects of these defects on students’ academic life, and described what teachers should do in such cases. The pre-service teachers couldn’t distinguish between digital eye-strain and general eye defects. It is suggested to provide pre-service and in-service training opportunities for pre-service teachers and teachers about digital eye-strain.

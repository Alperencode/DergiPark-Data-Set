Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of Different Cooking Methods  on Conjugated Linoleic Acids in Red Meat
Özet: This study was carried out to investigate the effect of different cooking techniques applied to meats on total CLAs, cis-9,trans-11-CLA (c9,t11-CLA) and trans-10,cis-12-CLA (t10,c12-CLA). . In the study, four different cooking methods such as boiling, frying, baking and grilling were applied to meat samples taken from the bovine carcasses. In raw and cooked meat samples, CLA, cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 isomer amounts were examined in Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) device.It was determined that the meat samples with frying treatment had the highest average value in total CLAs and c9,t11-CLAc9,t11-CLA. The difference between the total CLA values was found to be significant at the level of P < 0.01 and the difference between the mean values of the c9,t11-CLA at the level of P < 0.001. In other cooking methods, the difference between the mean values of total CLA, c9,t11-CLA and t10,c12-CLAwas not significant (P > 0.05). According to the findings obtained, it was concluded that thermal processes do not have a significant enhancing effect on the amount of CLAs in the meat and therefore, meat and products should be supplemented with CLAs to benefit from its positive effects.

Makale Başlığı: Ricci curvature for pointwise semi-slant warped products in non-Sasakian generalized Sasakian space forms and its applications
Özet: We find Ricci curvature bounds for pointwise semi-slant warped products submanifolds in non-Sasakian generalized Sasakian space forms in this work, and analyze the equality case of the inequality. The derived inequality is also used to develop a number of applications.

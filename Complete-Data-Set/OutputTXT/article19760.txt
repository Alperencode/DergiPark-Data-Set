Makale Başlığı: A DARK CONCEPT IN TOURISM: WAR TOURISM AND TWO INCIDENTS WITH RUSSIA
Özet: Tensions and conflicts between different nations from time to time have existed throughout history. Some of them even continued for years and eventually went to war. Many of these wars caused radical changes in those societies, and some even changed the fate of those societies. Naturally, tourism activities, whose subject is human, have also been affected by these conflicts and wars in many ways. Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by social events such as political turmoil and terrorist incidents within or outside the national borders. Today, the number of visits to the battlefields, which are carried out mostly with the effect of spiritual and national feelings, and their place in the tourism sector are increasing day by day. In this study, the results of the downing of a Russian army plane within the borders of Turkey on 24 November 2015 and the reflections of the Russia-Ukraine war that started on 26 February 2022 were evaluated in terms of tourism.

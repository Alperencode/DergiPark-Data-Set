Makale Başlığı: Classroom management of pre-service and beginning teachers: From dispositions to performance
Özet: Classroom management is a central aspect of effective teaching. It is related to student motivation and learning achievement. Unfortunately, pre-service and beginning teachers lack on classroom management competence. Therefore, this study aims to find out, which classroom management facets pre-service and beginning teachers struggle with and how they are associated with each other. Professional knowledge, self-efficacy, professional vision, and performance of 206 pre-service and beginning teachers were measured. As a result, medium to high levels of classroom management competence were found. Although self-efficacy and knowledge were partially associated with professional vision, professional vision was not significantly related to performance. Implications for further research on classroom management are discussed.

Makale Başlığı: The First Record of Viviparus contectus (Millet, 1813) in Demirköprü Dam Lake and Evaluation of Some Biometric Parameters
Özet: The aim of this study is to investigate some biometric characteristics of Viviparus contectus (Millet, 1813) in Demirköprü Dam Lake, Manisa province. Measurements of 180 individuals collected in the study area were performed using calipers and precision balances, and weight (g), width (mm), height (mm), aperture length and width (mm), spiral height (mm), body whorl height data were obtained. It was determined as 20.23±5.16 mm for shell height, 16.11±3.33 mm for shell width, 11.93±2.39 mm for aperture height, 9.71±2.11 mm for aperture width, 15.71±3.87 mm for body spiral height, 4.49±1.73 mm for spiral height and 4.50±0.93 g for weight. According to principal components analysis, there is a strong relationship between Shell height (KH), Shell width (KW), Aperture height (AH) and Body helezone height (VHS).V. contectus species has been reported for the first time from the region with this study.

Makale Başlığı: Do Individual Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Used During Pregnancy Show Any Differences in The Risk of Neonatal and Childhood Outcomes: An Overview
Özet: This review summarizes current data on the risk of neonatal and childhood outcomes associated with maternal use of individual selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy. Research articles and meta-analyses published in English language and curated in PubMed between January 2005 and April 2020 were screened. Based on limited available data, compared to others, slightly higher risks associated with individual SSRIs are as follows: paroxetine for preterm birth, escitalopram for low birth weight, sertraline and paroxetine for spontaneous abortion, fluoxetine for persistent pulmonary hypertension and fluoxetine and paroxetine for poor neonatal adapdation syndrome. Sertraline for persistent pulmonary hypertension and sertraline and paroxetine for autism spectrum disorders may be relatively safer compared to the other SSRIs. The current evidence is inadequate for definitive conclusions. Futher multicenter comparative studies are urgently needed.

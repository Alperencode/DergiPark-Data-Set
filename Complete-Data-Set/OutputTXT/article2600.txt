Makale Başlığı: Investigation of University Students' Internet Addiction Levels and Social Media Use Characteristics: A Descriptive Study
Özet: Excessive Internet use can lead to addiction and cyber bullying behaviors based on technology especially among the young. The aim of this study was to examine the Internet addiction levels and characteristics of social media use of peers following peer education regarding Internet addiction and cyber bullying awareness conducted among university students. This study is the second stage of the İzmir Universities Platform Administration Era of Dokuz Eylül University Social Responsibility Project: Digital Citizenship: Do Not Be Addicted and Bully, Use the Internet Consciously and Safely. The study examines the Internet use characteristics and Internet addiction levels of young people through interviews with university students who attended the peer awareness education with their peers. The study sample consisted of 1644 students, of which 188 students were entitled to receive a certificate following completion of peer education, selected by random sampling. The data were acquired through a Peer Interview Form, Internet Addiction and Cyber Bullying Peer Satisfaction Survey, and Internet Addiction Scale. The research findings revealed that Internet addiction was higher in male students than in female students, and the students who used the Internet more than 4 hours a day had high levels of loss of control, desire to stay online, and social relationship breakdowns. The students used the Internet mostly for social interaction/communication, listening to music, and watching movies rather than education and academic purposes. This study demonstrated that peer education can be used as an effective method in awareness studies regarding Internet use.

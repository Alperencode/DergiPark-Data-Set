Makale Başlığı: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: awareness and level of knowledge of a group of Turkish physicians
Özet: Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate physicians’ level of knowledge and awareness regarding the side effects of bisphosphonates (BPs).Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at University Hospital. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire given to a group of research assistants all of whom were required to prescribe BPs, including internists (oncologists, endocrinologists and rheumatologists), orthopaedic specialists, physiotherapists, obstetricians and gynaecologists, and urologists. The questionnaire consisted of a range of questions covering such matters as length of time in occupation, how information is given out, whether a dentist is consulted before or in the course of prescribing the medicine, and previous experience of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) and any treatment modifications.Results: Ninety-one out of 106 physicians included in our sample were found to be treating patients with BPs. Although 89% of the physicians informed their patients about the side effects of BPs, only 16.5% advised their patients to consult a dentist for dental treatment before prescribing BPs. When the different specialist groups were ranked in terms of their rate of dental referrals, from highest to lowest, the order was as follows: physiotherapists, internists, obstetricians and gynaecologists, urologists and orthopaedists. A statistically significant correlation was found between knowledge and specialty (p=0.02), but no significant correlation was observed between knowledge and years of experience (p=0.3).Conclusion: There is a lack of awareness among research assistants about the risk of MRONJ when prescribing BPs. Therefore, continuous education programmes and multiple interventions are needed to increase awareness.

Makale Başlığı: An Review on the Warfare Tactics of Qilij Arslan I, the Sultan of the Seljuqs of Rūm and the Military Characteristics of the Turkish Army in the First Crusade
Özet: At the end of the 11th century, the Christian world of Western Europe took action with the slogan of liberating Jerusalem, to expel the Turks from Anatolia and to damage the Islamic world dominating the Middle East. First the disorderly vanguards of the Crusaders, and then the professional armies entered Anatolia. The Seljuqs had to engage in a homeland defense against the Crusaders in Anatolia, where they settled a short time ago. Turkish armies under the command of Qilij Arslan I, the Sultan of the Seljuqs of Rūm, made pitched, siege, defensive and guerrilla warfare against the Crusaders. The Turks benefited from all the activities and factors required by these war types, each of which has different characteristics. In the uphill struggles between the Turks and the Crusaders, besides the main factors that constitute the army in material terms, including people, organization and equipment, many spiritual elements faced also each other. In this study, as part of the siege of Xerigordos, the raid of Drakon, the defense of Nicaea and the Battle of Dorylaion in the First Crusade, some evaluations will be made about the warfare tactics of Qilij Arslan I and the military characteristics of the Turkish army.

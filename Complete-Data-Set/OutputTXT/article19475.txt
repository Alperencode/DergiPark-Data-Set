Makale Başlığı: Personality Types Critized in the Qur'an within the Context of Baudrillard's Simulation Theory and Seeking the Reality in the Modern World
Özet: The simulation theory of Baudrillard, one of the important names of French world of thought, has been recently started to be taken into consideration in academic studies.. The basis of the simulation is pretending and this way of behaviour and thinking is intensely seen in the field of religion as well. Today’s people also spread the simulation to the field of religion in the large part of their daily lives. The truth revealed by religious texts is simulated by the changed references of reality and the reality becomes liveable on behalf of religion. It is seen that pretending that forms the basis of Baudrillard’s simulation theory has its counterpart in Islamic thought as well. The kinds of people behaving similarly to this way of behaviour are mentioned in Qur’an and hadiths. The examples are explained via hypocrisy, discord and shirk. In this context, it has been tried to reveal in our study that Baudrillard’s simulation theory is parallel to the concepts of hypocrisy, discord and shirk in Islamic sources.

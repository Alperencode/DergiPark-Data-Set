Makale Başlığı: Malaria as Fever Etiology Differential Diagnosis: A Case Study
Özet: Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by the bite of an anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium vivax is responsible for most cases. The gold standard for diagnosing is peripheral blood smear. Babesiosis is another zoonotic parasitic disease in which intra-erythrocyte parasites are recognized. After an indefinite period of years, P.vivax may progress with relapses. The clinical signs, laboratory findings and examination findings are very similar in malaria and babesiosis. Therefore, for the patients diagnosed with erythrocyte parasites are detected in the peripheral blood smear, the pre-diagnosis of both malaria and babesiosis should be considered and further investigations should be performed for the differential diagnosis. In this study, a case of malaria mixed with babesiosis is presented.

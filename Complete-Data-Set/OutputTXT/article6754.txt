Makale Başlığı: Galaxaura rugosa (J. Ellis & Solander) J.V. Lamouroux for Cosmeceutical Application: Antioxidant, Antibacterial, Tyrosinase and Elastase Inhibition Properties
Özet: Red seaweeds are considered novel sources of natural products with diverse biological activities that can be harness for drug synthesis. The bioactive properties of red macroalga, Galaxaura rugosa were studied. Results showed that the macroalga contain a total phenolic content (TPC) of 12.11 ± 0.22 mg GAE/g. The antioxidant activity of G. rugosa exhibited potent ABTS+ radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 81.00 μg GAE/ml) and high copper reduction capacity (IC50= 19.26 μg GAE/ml). Assessment of tyrosinase and elastase inhibition properties of G. rugosa extract showed that the alga has effective inhibitory activity with IC50 of 88.00 μg GAE/ml and IC50 of 243.00 μg GAE/ml, respectively which are more efficient than kojic acid and tocopherol. The seaweed extract exhibited potent antibacterial activities against common bacterial skin pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) = 125 μg/ml), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 125 μg/ml), and Staphylo- coccus epidermidis (MIC = 250 μg/ml). This study is considered a pioneering investigation that shows the potential of G. rugosa for cosmeceutical application.

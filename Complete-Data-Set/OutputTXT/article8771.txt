Makale Başlığı: Intensive care follow-up of an infant who underwent Yasui procedure due to interrupted aortic arch and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
Özet: Interrupted aortic arch (IAA) is a highly complex and difficult to manage congenital heart disease (CHD) manifesting in the neonatal period. In these cases, there is an anatomical and luminal interruption between the ascending and descending aorta. Formerly, IAA was considered to be a cardiac anomaly with high mortality, but nowadays its life expectancy is getting higher. The treatment of IAA is surgical repair of the arch. The presence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) requires more complicated surgical techniques. In this article, the intensive care process of a baby who underwent Yasui procedure for type B IAA and LVOTO and followed-up in neonatal intensive care unit after postoperative day 12 was discussed within the framework of cardiac patient monitoring principles.We aim that our experiences on the management of infant patients undergoing open heart surgery will be beneficial for nurses and physicians dealing with heart care.

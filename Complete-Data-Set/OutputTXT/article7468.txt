Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of Functional Levels of Children with Cerebral Palsy on Parents' Quality of Life in Northern Cyprus
Özet: The aim this research, determine the level of influence of families with children with cerebral palsy in Northern Cyprus and to reveal the difference in being affected between parents. The study was carried out on 49 children with CP and 49 couples of parents. Pediatric Functional Independence Measure (WeeFIM) was used to evaluate the functional status of children, and the Impact of Family Scale (IFS) and the Quality of Life Scale (SF-36) were used to measure the influence of families. Those with WeeFIM total score between 18-90, the group requiring observation (CNO) (n = 34), and those between 91-126 were divided into independent group (IC) (n = 15). No relationship was found between IFS, SF-36 score of parents and functional level of their children. There was a positive correlation between mothers and fathers in IFS and SF-36 scores within groups (CNO IFS p: 0,021 r: 0,394; CNO SF-36 p: 0,001 r: 0,546; IC IFS p: 0,038 r: 0,602; IC SF-36 p: 0,001 r: 0,825). When the levels of influence and quality of life of the mothers and fathers within the groups were compared, it was observed that there was not a significant difference between the mothers and fathers in the group CNO and in the IC group (p>0.05). According to this study family influences of parents with children with cerebral palsy in Northern Cyprus are not affected by their functional levels. The fact that there was no difference between mothers and fathers in terms of quality of life and level of influence revealed the geographical cultural difference in favor of women.

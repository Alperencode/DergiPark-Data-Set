The present study is of great cruciality since it includes the evaluation of the mentor system in Turkish music by the school representatives through the traditional education, on the basis of reed flute, and additionally what phases are taken in the process are narrated also by the school representatives. In this study, the population is confined to the notion of degree of competence in Turkish music and the sample is confined to one of the prominent figures of reed flute in the classical style, Kutb-i Nâyi Niyazi Sayın and his school. At the level of degree of competence in music, three students of Niyazi Sayın impose limitations on this study. As for methods, literature review and interviews are employed in the study. In the findings and discussions, the main focus is on the general components of the notions “style” and “degree of competence.” The headings, also the secondary problems of this study are interrogated through the interviews with three people who impose limitations on this study. As for the result, it has turned out that the notion of degree of competence adopted currently has been sustained to keep the traditions alive. However, it has been concluded that socio-cultural impacts are the most influential factor and obstacle in keeping the traditions alive and it is necessary to maintain the process for the degree of competence in music education and provide education accordingly.

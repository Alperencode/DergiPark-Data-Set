Makale Başlığı: Investigating Redundant on-Screen Text, Learner Control and Self-Regulation in a Foreign Language Learning Context
Özet: There are not sufficient guidelines for designing a multimedia learning environment for language teaching. This study aimed to examine the effects of the redundant on-screen text, learner control and self-regulatory skills on students’ learning simple past tense in an online tutorial that were variably used. English as foreign language learners (n=132) with beginner level of English studying at the preparatory school of English and Vocational School of Justice participated in this quasi-experimental study. All the groups received narrated slides, but additional instructional components in four treatment conditions were changed: Text with student control, text without student control, student control without text, and without text and student control. Each participant was given a prior knowledge test, an academic self-regulation scale, a retention test and a transfer test. Statistical analysis of data showed that redundant on-screen text is not a hinder in language learning context; and that providing novice learners with a learner-controlled system would result in a deterioration in learning. Rather, it is more useful if the learners are guided through a pre-structured and controlled system, which would alleviate the cognitive burden in the novice learners with low experience and prior knowledge in the course material. Further, results for self-regulation are not congruent with each other: In some conditions students with low self-regulation outperformed students with high self-regulation in retention or transfer tests, and in some others vice versa. The study discussed the findings and presented some implications.

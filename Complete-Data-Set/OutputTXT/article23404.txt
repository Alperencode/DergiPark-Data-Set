Makale Başlığı: The use of Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and Rorschach Inkblot Test in the evaluation of mental trauma in clinical and forensic context
Özet: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health problem that can occur generally because of the threat of death or serious injury. Psychological assessment tools are often used in the clinical evaluation of PTSD, whose symptoms are likely to be confused with different diagnoses. In forensic areas, people working in the mental health field often have to evaluate the presence of PTSD, especially in applications with compensation claims. This study, it was aimed to examine the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), and Rorschach Inkblot Test which are widely used in clinical and forensic psychological evaluation, and the profile characteristics that emerge in the studies where trauma victims are evaluated. Besides, the presentation of compiled information in the literature is also among the aims of this study. Studies showed that MMPI, TAT, and Rorschach Inkblot Test can be used successfully in the evaluation of trauma, but it is frequently emphasized that the information obtained from the tests alone can cause misleading results when deciding on diagnosis or forensic situations. In such cases, it is especially important to use psychological evaluation tools, and mental health professionals evaluating PTSD should have knowledge of the literature on this subject and follow current studies and so it could be ensured that the evaluations are handled more accurately.

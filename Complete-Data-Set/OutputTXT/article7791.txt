Makale Başlığı: Pollen Morphology of Some Taxa Belonging to Polygonum L. and Rumex L. (Polygonaceae) and Its Taxonomic Significance
Özet: In this article, the pollen morphologies of 14 samples in total, 12 taxa from Polygonum L., Rumex L. (Polygonaceae), and two variations of Rumex scutatus L. were studied in detail by light microscopy and SEM. Solutions to taxonomic problems of these species were sought with palynological information. Pollen grains of some taxa belonging to Polygonum are studied as a result of palynological research; 3-colpate, 3-colporate, pantoporate, oblate-spheroidal, prolate, prolate-spheroidal, tectate, and exine surface are microechinate-perforate and reticulate with the free-standing columella. Pollen grains of some taxa belonging to Rumex; 3-colporate, rarely 4-colporate, pollen shapes are oblate-spheroidal, suboblate, tectate, and exine surface are microechinate-perforate.

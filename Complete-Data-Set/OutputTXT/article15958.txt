Makale Başlığı: Effects of different uprooting dates on rooting and vegetative development parameters of different American grapevine rootstock scions
Özet: This study was conducted in the years 2013 and 2014 to determine rooting and vegetative development parameters of different American grapevine rootstock (‘5BB’, ‘110R’, ‘140Ru’, ‘1613C’, ‘1103P’ and ‘41B’) scions uprooted in different dates. Present findings revealed that hard and insufficient rooting problems especially of ‘140Ru’, ‘41B’ and ‘110R’ American grapevine rootstock scions were resulted from genetic characteristics and insufficient number of days between uprooting and planting dates. Significant increases were observed in rooting ratio (%), number of roots (roots/scion), root fresh weight (g scion–1), root scale (0–4), shoot length (cm), number of nodes (leaves) (nodes/scion), shoot fresh weight (g scion–1), scion weight (g) and shooting ratio (%) of American grapevine rootstock scions with the increasing number of days between uprooting and planting dates.

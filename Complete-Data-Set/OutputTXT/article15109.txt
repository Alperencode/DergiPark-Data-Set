Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the effects of boron application on germination and early seedling development of sugar beet
Özet: Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is a major source of sugar on a global scale. Despite the fact that the sugar beet crop has a high need for boron (B), there is little data on the effect of B applications on germination and seedling growth. A laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the effects of boron application on sugar beet germination, and seedling stage. The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design with three replications. Cultivar ‘BR1’ was treated with five levels of boron (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 ppm) for the experiment. According to analysis of variance (ANOVA). It was found that the root length, seedling height, seedling dry weight as well as seedling emergence rate and seedling emergence vigour were considerably affected by boron administrations. As a result, 0.2 ppm boron application had a positive effect on the root length, seedling height, seedling dry weight, seedling emergence rate and seedling emergence vigour. However, 1.6 ppm boron application had a negative effect on investigated traits.

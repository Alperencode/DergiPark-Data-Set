Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Individuals' Financial Risk Tolerance, Financial Literacy and Financial Attitude on their Financial Behaviors
Özet: Studies in the personal finance literature reveal that individuals are influenced by psychological factors in their financial decisions. In this context, research on sociocultural and demographic factors is insufficient in studies to examine financial behavior of individuals. In the research, the effects of financial risk tolerance, financial literacy, and financial attitude factors on individuals' financial behaviors are tried to be examined. The data obtained with the voluntary participation of 1347 individuals from İstanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Kocaeli, Bursa, Sivas, and Karabük cities of Turkey were collected by questionnaire method. The collected data were analysed by multiple linear regression method. As a result, in the study, which aims to examine the factors affecting the financial behavior of individuals, it has been determined that financial risk tolerance, financial literacy and financial attitude have a significant effect on financial behavior.

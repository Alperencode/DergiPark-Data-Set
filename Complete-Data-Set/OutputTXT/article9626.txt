Makale Başlığı: OPTIMIZATION of PLATINUM BATHS USED in JEWELRY INDUSTRY in TURKEY
Özet: Platinum group metals are used a lot in fields such as jewellery, electronics and health due to being precious metals and their brightness, corrosion resistance, thermal resistance and electrical conductivity. With the excessive increase in the prices of gold and rhodium, which are the most used in the jewelry sector, a tendency towards the more affordable platinum metal has begun. In this study, the optimization of baths used in the jewelry industry, which is one of the areas where platinum coating is used most, is discussed. The conditions required for the re-coating of the platinum bath, which is used and separated as waste in jewelry workshops, were investigated experimentally. A waste bath was taken from a jewelry plating workshop in the Grand Bazaar, and the content of the bath was determined by ICP-OES analysis and IR Spectroscopy. Later, on this waste platinum bath, a few substances, which are used as brighteners in the market, and which show parallel diffraction with the original bath in FTIR analysis were added and the effects of temperature, current and time parameters on the coating were investigated. L*a*b values were measured with PCE Instruments Colorimeter device by making platinum coating on brass-coated plates using the waste bath to which brighteners were added. As a result of the study, the brighteners and color properties of the coated surfaces and the reference coating properties were compared.

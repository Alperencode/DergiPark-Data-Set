Makale Başlığı: Population Fluctuation and Predators of Tinocallis (Sappocallis) saltans (Nevsky, 1929) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Harmful on Elm Trees (Ulmus glabra Hudson) in Erzurum Province
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the population fluctuation and predators of Tinocallis (sappocallis) saltans (Nevsky, 1929) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) found to be intensely damaged in the Elm (Ulmus glabra Hudson) plant in Erzurum (Atatürk University Campus) between May and September in 2016 and 2017. T. saltans was determined for the first time on this elm species in Turkey with this study. Elm tip shoots were taken from the area at 4 days intervals and brought to the laboratory condition and adults and nymphs counts were made in this study. In addition, predator species were collected with the help of aspirator, atrap and Japanese umbrella. Pre-adult periods of predator species were brought to the laboratory together with the shoots and adult outputs were obtained by culturing. At the end of the study, T. saltans in July 27 (56.83 adult+nymph), 4 August (52.32 adult+nymph) and 24 August (47.66 adult+nymph) in 2016, and 12 August (39.36 adult+nymph) in 2017, has reached the highest number of individuals per leaf. A total of 12 predators from 4 Coccinellidae (Adalia bipunctata (L.), Adalia fasciatopunctata revelieri Mulsant; Coccinella septempunctata (L.), Harmonia quadripunctata (Pontoppidan) of Coleoptera; 1 Anthocoridae (Orius horvathi Reut.), 1 Nabidae family (Nabis pseudoferus Rem.) of Hemiptera; 5 Syrphidae (Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), Eristalis pratorum (Meigen), Sphaerophoria rueppelli (Wiedemann), Sphaerophoria scripta (L.), Syritta pipiens (L.) of Diptera; 1 Chrysopidae (Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens)) of Neuroptera were identified in this study. Of these species respectively, A. f. revelieri (39 individuals), H. quadripunctata (21 individuals), C. semtempunctata ve Ch. carnea (16 individuals) and E. balteatus (14 individual) were the species with the highest number of individuals. T. saltans for all of these predator species were determined as the new host for the first time in this study in Turkey. It is great importance to consider these predators in these insect-control studies.

Makale Başlığı: Online listening strategy instruction in teaching Turkish as an L2
Özet: Listening strategies are enacted plans that one can use to better understand, learn, remember, and comprehend a target language. The present study aims to examine how the process of listening strategy instruction may be implemented in the teaching of Turkish to L2 learners. The study was a qualitative one, conducted with the action research method on an online platform, Zoom. Five Turkish L2 learners participated in the study. The results show that students used the listening strategies in various frequencies and combinations during the implementation process. Throughout the implementation process, the least used strategies were relating with prior information, performance evaluation, monitoring, and inferencing, while the most frequently used strategies were note-taking, determining keywords, translating, and prediction. The students stated that prediction, note-taking, and planning were the most useful strategies for them during the implementation process. Also, the use of authentic videos in online listening strategy instruction lessons contributed to students' learning in diverse areas of interest, particularly learning new vocabulary, and thus motivate them.

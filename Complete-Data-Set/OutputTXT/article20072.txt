Makale Başlığı: Personalization of the Found Object
Özet: The transformations that art has been through in the 20. century involve the material as well. Material is a concept which has inspired many ideas in the 20. century not only because of it’s relation with the form but also with the content. Especially, this transformation period has gained wide currency globally beginning from the mid-century. The incorporation of everyday objects into the art, has given many opportunities to create aut-hentic language for the artists besides the art movements. The potential of the found material allows not only plastic arts but also the multisciplinarily structured contemporary art to have an international language enables common communication. The art object which has developed semantically by means of philosophy has also improved content creation capacity. In this context, the found material has an important role at creating contemporary thought compatible with today’s life.

Makale Başlığı: Security Control Process Modeling During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Example Of Esenboğa Airport
Özet: Airport facilities are places where constantly updated measures, regulations and improvements are implemented. Simulation modeling plays an important role in ensuring the high efficiency and user friendliness of such arrangements. Especially in recent years, simulation has become an indispensable need for the aviation industry. Contrary to traditional theories, the simulation approach reveals a more realistic system behavior analysis. One of the most important operations carried out at airports is undoubtedly the security checkpoints. Simulation of airport security checkpoints is the basis for more efficient use of these service points, improving the service level, identifying bottlenecks in the system and producing solutions. In this study, it is aimed to calculate the delay and queue data created by the precautions and regulations applied in the Esenboğa Airport terminal building after the Covid-19 pandemic, at the security checkpoint after the visa checkpoint. In the study, it is aimed to determine the problems that can be caused by the precautions and regulations taken in airport security by modeling the security control process after the Covid-19 pandemic by using the simulation method. The simulation model was created by taking expert opinions in accordance with the operation carried out at the airport. Finally, the results of the simulation model were evaluated, and suggestions were made to the airport stakeholders.

Makale Başlığı: International Institutions’ Employment Policies Regarding Elderly Labor: An Analysis of Certain Countries
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the employment policies of international organizations regarding the elderly workforce along the axis of the global demographic transition process. For this purpose, the study investigates the measures taken toward elderly employment in certain developed countries where the effects of aging have been felt intensely for a long time. In this context, the study first examines the changes in regional population structures with respect to the world and development levels between the years 1950-2050 and then discusses the proposals international organizations have developed regarding the aging population issue based on the effects these changes have had on economy and social security, which are heavily affected by aging. Afterward, the study looks at examples of good practices within the framework of three policy axes that came to the fore in the policy documents of these organizations that have increased the employability of older workers: rewarding long stays in employment, late retirement, and encouraging employers to employ older workers. As a result, taking all the steps that support elderly employment in cooperation with all social parties, especially the state, employers, and workers, is considered an important issue for implementing policies on elderly employment.

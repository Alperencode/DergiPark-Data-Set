Makale Başlığı: THE FORMATION PROCESS OF FIBER ARTWORKS CREATED WITH NATURAL FIBERS AND NATURAL DYES: BEYOND WATER
Özet: Natural life is a phenomenon that exists in the creation of human beings and is focused on fulfilling the purpose of meeting basic needs. In the context of clothing and textiles, people obtained fibers from plants and animal hides and used them to cover their bodies due to the need for protection from cold weather conditions and other environmental factors. With the development of technology and the diversification of materials over time, new techniques have been discovered and fibers have been turned into textile surfaces. These textile surfaces are used with their own natural colors as well as being colored with the help of different natural and artificial dyes. Many colors in different structures and tones can be obtained from natural dye sources such as flowers, leaves, plants, soil and rocks. Within the scope of this study, dyestuffs were obtained from different natural sources and natural fibers were colored with these dyes. Colored fibers were used in different forms and shapes. Within the scope of this study, the importance of marine life and the effects of sea and water pollution on the environment and living life were emphasized. The fiber art work called “Beyond Water” was revealed. The work has been applied on the canvas, and the design process and applied steps have been conveyed.

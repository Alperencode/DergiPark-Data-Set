Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Chitosan and Chitosan Oligosaccharide on Serum Mineral and Vitamin Levels in Rats with Experimental Fluorosis
Özet: Fluorine toxicity occurs in different parts of the world. It is caused by the increase in the fluorine level in the waters, especially due to the dissolution of volcanic rocks over time. Water with high fluorine content can be taken with plant and animal irrigations, and foods obtained from plants and animals, or it can be taken directly with drinking water. In this study, the effects of chitosan (CS) and chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) on some serum trace minerals and vitamin levels in experimental fluorosis rats were investigated. Six groups were formed as control, fluorosis, fluorosis CS and COS groups, healthy CS and COS groups. CS and COS were administered orally for 28 days at a dose of 250 mg/kg. At the end of the study, ketamine anesthesia was administered and the heart was directly cannulated. Trace minerals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Se) and vitamins (retinol, α-tocopherol, D3) were analyzed. Cu, Zn, Se and Mn levels were found to be decreased in the F group compared to the control group. A significant increase was found in the Zn level in the F+CS group and in the Cu, Zn and Se levels in the F+CS group compared to the values in the F group. Serum retinol and α -tocopherol levels were decreased in the F, F+CS, F+COS and CS groups. In conclusion, our findings showed that there was a decrease in serum Zn, Cu, Se, retinol and α-tocopherol levels in rats with fluorosis, and COS was more effective than CS against the decrease in mineral and vitamin levels.

The theses included in the scope of the study were examined under different headings such as year, type, subject, approach, research design, sample, data collection tool, and data analysis techniques. This research is important in terms of giving a general idea about the studies carried out in the field of gifted students and mathematics education, providing information pertaining to the relevant literature for the studies to be carried out, helping expand the field with studies with more different content by determining the subjects and scopes that have not been researched in the field, and giving inspiration related to different research ideas that will contribute to the literature.

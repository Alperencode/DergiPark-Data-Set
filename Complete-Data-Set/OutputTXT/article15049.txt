Makale Başlığı: TEMPORARY REPRODUCTION OF LITERARY AND ARTISTIC WORKS DUE TO TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
Özet: According to the Law on Intellectual and Artistic Works, the right of reproduction of a work is an exclusive right of the copyright owner (Art.22). Reproduction means making the work directly or indirectly perceptible by human senses by fixing it to a tool that is used for the transmission or repetition of a sign, sound or image. Whether the determination is permanent or temporary is irrelevant according to the applicable regulation for the right of reproduction. Thus, a wide-ranging protection is provided to the owners of the works. However, the inclusion of temporary reproductions arising from technical requirements in this context is incompatible with some requirements of the information society. For this reason, in the draft text regarding the amendments envisaged to be made in the Law on Intellectual and Artistic Works, an exception provision has been introduced for reproductions arising from technical necessity. In this study, the application conditions of the draft provision are examined and other ways to solve the problem within the framework of current regulations are discussed.

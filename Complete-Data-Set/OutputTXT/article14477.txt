Makale Başlığı: A Comparison of the Short-Term Efficacy of Physiotherapy Approaches in Patients with Lateral Epicondylitis
Özet: The study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of radial nerve self-mobilization [RNSM], manual therapy [MT], and extracorporeal shock wave therapy [ESWT] on pain, pain-free grip strength, functional status, and patient satisfaction in patients with Lateral Epicondylitis [LE] and to determine the superiority of these methods to each other. 48 patients diagnosed with LE were included in the study and were randomly divided into three groups. RNSM was applied to all patients as a home program. The first group [n=16] received only the RNSM as a home program, the MT  group [n=16] received MT combined with RNSM, and the ESWT group [n=16] received ESWT combined with RNSM. The RNSM was applied five days per week, and the MT and ESWT for two sessions per week for three weeks. Pain severity, pain-free handgrip strength, functionality levels, and patient satisfaction were evaluated before and after three weeks of treatment. The pain level significantly decreased, and handgrip strength and functionality increased in all groups after three weeks [p<0.001]. In comparison between the groups, the decrease in pain level, the increase in maximum grip strength, and patients' overall satisfaction scores were found to be higher in the MT group than in the ESWT, and only the RNSM groups [p<0.05]. MT application combined with radial nerve self-mobilization exercises in the treatment of LE appears to be more effective.

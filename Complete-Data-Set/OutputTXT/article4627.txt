Makale Başlığı: Oral and Written Interlanguage Performance Analysis of Yeditepe University ELT Pre-service Teachers
Özet: Committing errors is one of the crucial issues of language learning. Nevertheless, most of the time, instructors are not able to understand the reasons behind these errors. Therefore, one of the concerns that EFL instructors have in mind is the errors that the foreign language learners make because it is essential to see the learner's progress and provide accurate feedback. In this respect, Error Analysis (EA) tries to demonstrate language learners' interlanguage, what the learner knows and does not know (Corder, 1974). That is why this study aims to explore sources of errors made by the five Turkish ELT program pre-service teachers in their written and oral performances through a data collected spontaneous procedure and free written and oral designed tasks.  Also, it tries to assist EFL instructors in becoming familiar with the most frequent errors committed by EFL learners and lead language practitioners to take into account significant issues about understanding the prominence of error analysis and ways of error correction in the process of foreign language teaching.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Nitrogen Doses and Application Periods on some Yield Components of Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the effects of different nitrogen doses and application periods on plant growth and plant yield in oil sunflower under Kırşehir ecological conditions in 2020. In the study, which was carried out to the randomized blocks design in split plot arrangement with three replications, 6 different nitrogen doses (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 kg/da N) and 3 different application periods (100% sowing period, 50% sowing-% 50 anchor periods and 100% anchor periods) were applied. In the study, emergence, flowering and maturity time (day), stem thickness (mm), seed kernel ratio (%), harvest index (%), total grain number (piece/head), full grain ratio (%) and plant seed yield (table/g) were determined.While the increase in nitrogen doses, the emergence, flowering and maturation period were postponedand stem thickness, seed kernel ratio, number of grains, full grain ratio and plant yield were increased. According to nitrogen application periods and nitrogen dose applications, the highest plant grain yield (72.64 g/plant) was obtained from 100% planting period and 12 kg/da nitrogen application.

Makale Başlığı: Semi-Symmetric Generalized Sasakian Space Forms On Some Special Curvature Tensors
Özet: In this article, semi-symmetric generalized Sasakian space forms are investigated on some special curvature tensors. Characterizations of generalized Sasakian space forms are obtained on some specially selected $\sigma-$curvature tensors. By examining the flatness of these $\sigma -$curvature tensors, the properties of generalized sasakian space forms are given. More importantly, the cases of $\sigma-$semi-symmetric generalized Sasakian space forms are discussed and the behavior of the manifold is examined for each case. Again, necessary and sufficient conditions have been obtained for $\sigma-$symmetric generalized Sasakian space forms to be Einstein manifolds.

Under these conditions, it is understandable how important in hot regions the opportunity to drink ice water is in hot regions. Therefore, it reflected in some history books ice story which turned to a commercial commodity and exciting adventure that no less famous for a precious jewel in the hot Islamic countries. There are interesting records in the sources about the ice trade and transport that took place in the medieval Islamic world. Looking at these documents, it is drawing our attention that the snow masses obtained from the mountainous regions of Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq were turned into ice at the beginning of summer, and they were specially packaged and shipped as valuable goods to the Hejaz and Egypt, and finally, the way they were used in snow sales centers. These include how the ice arrived intact during its passage through hundreds of kilometers of roads under scorching heat; which routes and roads are followed; it is a matter of curiosity about what points are taken into consideration during the transportation process. Therefore, this article on these topics and the overall adventure of ice in the medieval Islamic world will be analyzed from some Arabic sources.

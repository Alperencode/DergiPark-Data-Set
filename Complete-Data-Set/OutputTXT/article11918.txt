Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Gifted Education Teacher Training Policies in Turkey: A Document Analysis Study
Özet: The aim of this research is to evaluate the gifted education teacher trainingpolicies in our country in the light of international and national policydocuments. The study was designed as a qualitative research and nationalpolicy documents were used as data collection tool. Data were collected bydocument analysis method. The documents were analysed in the context ofeducation policy, gifted education, gifted teacher training, their selection andprofessional development of these teachers. It is striking that the education ofgifted people has been given more place in the policy documents in recentyears. It is seen that most of the decisions taken have not been implemented. Itis understood that the teachers haven’t received adequate training on giftededucation before the service, the trainings on the gifted were mostly forBİLSEM teachers, the training needs of the teachers in formal educationinstitutions were ignored, the in-service training was insufficient, and theteachers had a training need in this area. Although positive steps have beentaken in the policies of teacher training, selection and professional developmentin the field of gifted education in our country, it is understood that a stablepolicy has not yet been established.

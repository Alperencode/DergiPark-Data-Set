Makale Başlığı: Examining the Mediating Role of Tawakkul in the Relationship between Religious Attitude and Psychological Resilience
Özet: This study aims to examine the mediating role of tawakkul (reliance in God) in the relationship between religious attitude and psychological resilience. The method of this study is correlational study design, which is a quantitative research model. In the study “Religious Attitude Scale”, “Tawakkul Scale” and “Brief Resilience Scale” were used as data collection tools. Sample group has of a total of 387 people consisting of 154 male (39,8%) and 233 female (60,2%) participants. The study, the total, direct and indirect impact values and the bootstrap confidence intervals of the mediator role of tawakkul for the relationship between religious attitude and psychological resilience were calculated. The study total impact value was found as 0,1567, the direct impact value as -0,0404 and the indirect impact value as 0,1971. While the direct impact of religious attitude on psychological resilience is negative 04%, if tawakkul is also included in the process, the total impact rises up to the 15% level positively. 15% of this total impact results from the mediator effect of tawakkul. When the changes in the p value in the effect of religious attitude over psychological resilience is observed, it is seen that while it is significant as .01 in Model 3, it is found to be .62 in Model 2, which makes it insignificant. This shows us that reliance in God has a full mediator effect in the relationship between religious attitude and psychological resilience.

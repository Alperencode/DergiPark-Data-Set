Makale Başlığı: Prevalence of Ehrlichia Canis, Borrelia Burgdorferi and Dirofilaria Immitis in Sivas Stray and Shelter Dogs
Özet: Objective: In this study, it was aimed to investigate the prevalence of vector-transportable Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in Sivas province. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 100 dogs. Breed, age and sexes of dogs were determined and physical examinations were performed and serum samples were collected for the diagnosis of the diseases. The commercial rapid test kit SNAP* 4DX* Plus (IDEXX Laboratories) was used for the detection of Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Dirofilaria immitis in dogs. Results: In this study, it was determined that 1% of 100 dogs examined were Ehrlichia canis and 2% of them were seropositive to Dirofilaria immitis, while Borrelia burgdorferi seropositive animals were not detected. Conclusion: As a result, it was determined that Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Dirofilaria immitis, which can be transmitted to dogs by vectors, were observed at low rates in Sivas province. However, at the same time, necessary protective measures should be taken against these diseases that can be transmitted by vectors in this region.

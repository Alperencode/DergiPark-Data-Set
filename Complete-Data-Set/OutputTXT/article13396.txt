Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Academics' Anti-vaccination and Rational Drug Use Behaviors
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study is to reveal the difference in academics' anti-vaccine and rational drug use behaviors according to their sociodemographic characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out with 468 academics working in different fields in Turkey. A Sociodemographic Information Form, the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, and Rational Drug Use Scale were used to collect data online. The data were analyzed via the independent sample t-test, ANOVA and Tukey's test. Results: The level of vaccine hesitancy was significantly higher in male, and between the ages of 31-40, and who were working in the field of physical sciences. Female academics, and professors, and who working in the field of health sciences exhibited more rational drug use behaviors (p<0.01). Conclusion and Recommendations: A significant difference was observed in the vaccine hesitancy status of academics according to field, title, and age and in rational drug use according to field, title, and gender. Governments, health managers, and policymakers can be recommended to collaborate with prominent young and senior scientists, particularly those working in the field of physical sciences and health sciences, to protect and improve public health.

Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Using Animations on Sixth Grade Students’ Academic Success in Turkish  Grammar Learning
Özet: The purpose of this empirical study is to determine how and to what extent the use of animations impacts auditory acquisition, one of the key learning fields in 6th grade grammar, as measured by students’ academic success and completion rates. By using a pre-test and post-test design, this emrical study randomly divided a group of Turkish 6th graders into an experimental and a control group, who were taught the same standard lessons (as set forth in the Turkish annual lesson plan) by the same teacher for a period of 10 weeks. In addition to the standard lessons, the experimental group was also shown animations. The results revealed that phonetics performance improved for both the experimental and the control group, but that the group who had been shown the animations improved much more than the group who had been instructed via traditional methods only

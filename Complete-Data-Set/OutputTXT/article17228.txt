Makale Başlığı: The Grammatical Judgment of Ibn-Jinni via his book Characteristics
Özet: Grammar is one of the Arabic language sciences that arose to serve the Holy Qur’an through understanding the Arabic language and its rules. Grammar passed through four phases in its inception, the stage of placement and formation, the stage of emergence and growth, the stage of maturity and perfection, the stage of weighting and numeracy in classification. These stages were overlapping despite the differentiation and development of each stage from its predecessors, in each of the stages were grammatical terms. This research studies the grammatical judgment and its types through the book of Ibn Jinni “Al-Khasais”, which was one of the first books of the Arabic language. The grammatical judgment is attribution and ruling by something over something/someone, like ruling on Zayd by hard-working in the sentence (Zayd mujtahid). The (Musnad) is what is ruled by, the (Musnad Elayh) is what is ruled on. The main grammatical ruling is syntax and construction, the sub-grammatical ruling is the nominative, accusative, genitive and assertive and the description of the grammatical ruling is the obligatory, the forbidden, the good, the ugly, the difference of the first and equally permissible.

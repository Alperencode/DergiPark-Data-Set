Makale Başlığı: An Integrated Example of Cultural Diplomacy:  A Study on the ‘Hallyu Wave’
Özet: Preserving the reputation, image and power of the states that are in communication and interaction is only possible with the smooth conduct of diplomatic relations. One of the most important strategies developed in overcoming these problems is that states take various initiatives to endear their cultural values to the citizens of other countries. This process, in which there is no force and oppression, takes place with cultural diplomacy, which is seen as a sub-branch of public diplomacy. Many elements from movies, TV series and music to sports competitions, from food culture to clothing can be products of cultural diplomacy. In this study, it is problematized how cultural products belonging to a country interact with the citizens of other countries as a soft power element. The aim of the study is to reveal how cultural products are presented as a diplomacy tool, and to show how they can be used more effectively in interstate communication. The study, which focuses on the ‘Hallyu-Wave’ through the example of South-Korea, was carried out by adopting the principles of the qualitative research method. In the sample of Sakarya University Faculty of Communication students, the consumption patterns of Korean cultural products were expressed by the descriptive analysis method by applying to interview, one of the data collection techniques. As a result, it has been seen that Korean cultural products are on the rise around the world, and that they have a positive effect on people, especially the youth, in Turkey, and create sympathy for Korean culture.

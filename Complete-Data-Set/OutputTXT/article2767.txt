Makale Başlığı: Leaf Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Carbon Variation, and N and P Resorption in Diospyros kaki L. along an Altitudinal Gradient
Özet: In the present study, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C) levels and nutrient contents, N and P resorption were investigated in Diospyros kaki L., whose leaves has a strong antioxidant property and is cultivated in the Eastern Black Sea Region. The research was carried out at four different locations where Diospyros kaki was grown within the provincial borders of Trabzon. Leaf samples were taken from these selected locations monthly from May to December. Soil samples were taken from a depth of 0-20 cm from each locality. Soil N, P and C analysis were also determined. There were important differences in N (%) concentration and N (g dm-2) content values in terms of localities. N, P and C (%) concentration values significantly varied among months. Similarly, there were notable differences in N and P (g dm-2) values depending on months. Nitrogen and phosphorus resorption efficiency (RE) values were below stated boundaries at only 796 m. Nitrogen and phosphorus resorption proficiency (RP) values significantly varied between localities.

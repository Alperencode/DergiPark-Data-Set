Makale Başlığı: Use of Nettle (Urtica dioica L.) in the Treatment of Fish Diseases
Özet: The increase in demand for fish and fish products has led to the spread of the culture fish. Fish breeders have used some chemicals or plant extracts that stimulate or enhance the immune system to protect fish from diseases. Although the use of chemical medicines has many negative effects on the environment and human health, chemotherapy is widely used in the prevention and treatment of diseases. As an alternative to chemical treatments, the use of plant extracts in combating diseases seen in water products has become widespread. Various plant species such as thyme, garlic, fenugreek and nettle are used in the treatment of different diseases in traditional folk medicine as well as in fish health and increase disease resistance and efficiency in aquaculture. Nettle is a perennial plant of the Urticaceae family, abundant in our country. Root, stem, leaves, flowers and seeds of nettle are used as herbal medicines. Nettle has many biocomponents such as polysaccharides, lignans, flavonoids, coumarins, terpenoids, phenol and Urtica dioica aglutinin (UDA) which is a lectin, and it has been reported that nettles generally have antiinflammatory, antiallergic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anticarcinogenic effects.  There are studies in the literature that have found positive effects on the immune system and growth performance of nettle on experimental animals. In this review, a study has been conducted on the use of nettle weed as an alternative to chemical medicines in the prevention and treatment of fish diseases.

Makale Başlığı: English and Its Labeling
Özet: The present paper tries to explore and explain the ongoing debate for English and its labelings such as EIL, ELF, and World Language with the contribution of linguistics pioneers and some of their studies by literature review. The worldwide proliferation of the English language is not only linguistic, but also aids in the dissemination of data in the fields of studies, economics, and politics. Technological advances, industry, research, culture, and media are the other reasons why English has become so common and international around the world. It is also not only an elite language since it does not substitute for other languages that are learnable in a local environment. ‘English as a Lingua Franca (ELF)’ or ‘English as an International Language (EIL)’ are the preferred words by many scholars (House, 1999). Some scholars generally believe that there is no distinction between the words ELF, World Languages, or EIL. These are definitions ascribed to the structure of the language itself over time. Regardless of one’s mother tongue, people all speak in a more or less regular way at times. This can be disturbing and deviating for L2 speakers and learners. They are unsure if non-traditional or traditional language forms are the standard. The solution for preferring the standard one in the printed way can be achieved by serving the cultural aspects of a language and the norms with coursebooks. Even though it is too late for taking an action against the World Englishes because of the impact and usage in the World, there can be some pleasing ways and methods to make them understandable and pay respect to the ideas, as well.

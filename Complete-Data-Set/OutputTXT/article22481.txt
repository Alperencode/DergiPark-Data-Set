Makale Başlığı: Three-dimensional modeling of the Kubbe-i Hasiye Shrine with terrestrial photogrammetric method
Özet: Natural and unnatural structures, which are the subject of our cultural heritage, are in constant danger of extinction as a result of both man-made destruction and natural events such as natural disasters, rains and strong winds. Therefore, it is necessary to take very good protection measures in order to keep cultural assets alive and transfer them to future generations. In the light of today's technology, different techniques have been developed to take these protection measures. One of these techniques is terrestrial photogrammetry technique. With this technique, all the details of the building are measured and a three-dimensional visual model of the building can be created thanks to the pictures of the building. Thus, by recording all the features of the building such as detail dimensions, shape, size, type of building material, necessary interventions can be made in case of any structural deterioration, modification and repair that may occur in the building. In this study, it is aimed to measure the Kubbe-i Hasiye tomb located in the center of Tillo district of Siirt province, photogrammetrically, and to make a three-dimensional modeling with the pictures taken of the tomb by making three-dimensional modeling. As a result of the measurements made on the model obtained as a result of the study, precision was obtained in the reference intervals determined and the amount of error was determined below 2 cm.

Makale Başlığı: Discrepancy between Cervical Disc Prostheses and Anatomical Cervical Dimensions in Turkish Population
Özet: Objective: In recent years Cervical Total Disc Replacement (CTDR) has become a popular method for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy in Turkey. Most medical companies design their implant sizes from published cadaver studies. An unfitted prosthesis may lead to subsidence, loosening and biomechanical failure due to an incorrect center of rotation. The purpose of the this study was to measure the dimensions of cervical vertebrae based on Computed Tomography (CT) scans and define the correctness of match in available cervical disc prostheses. Methods: The anatomic dimensions of the C3-C7 segments were measured of 50 patients (age range 26-47 years)with CT scans and evaluated with the sizes of the popular cervical total disc prostheses (CTDP) at the market [Bryan (Medtronic), Prodisc-C (Synthes), Prestige LP (Medtronic), Discover (DePuy)]. The mediolateral and anterior-posterior diameters of the upper and lower endplates were measured with a digital measuring system.  Results:  Overall, 43.7 % of the largest implant footprints were smaller in the anterior-posterior diameter and 42.6 % in the mediolateral diameter were smaller than cervical endplate measurements. Discrepancy of the level C5/C6 and C6/C7 was calculated 56.2 %  at the anteroposterior diameter and at the center mediolateral diameter 43.8 %.  Conclusion: Large disparity has been found between sizes of devices and cervical anatomic data. Companies that produce CTDP should take care of the anatomical dimensions and generate different sizes of CTDP for Turkish population. Size missmatch in CTDP that may affect the clinical and radiological outcome should be known by the spine surgeons. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2016.15.0373This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

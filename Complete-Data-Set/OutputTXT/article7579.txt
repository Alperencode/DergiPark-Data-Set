Makale Başlığı: Development of Ozone Effecting System Without Using Harmful Chemicals
Özet: Recently, new bleaching methods are developed and presented as an eco-friendly alternative for the traditional bleaching processes. Traditional bleaching chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite, potassium persulfate, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, and benzoyl peroxide is harmful to human health and the environment. In this study, new eco-friendly and sustainable denim bleaching processes are developed. Textile washing and giving effect process is provided by using only ozone with different techniques without using any harmful chemicals. In terms of both technical and visual aspects, successful results have been obtained in comparison with the traditional method in ozone technology. This new method process time, and water consumption has been approximately reduced in 53% ratio.

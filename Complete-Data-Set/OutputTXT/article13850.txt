Makale Başlığı: FRAMEWORK CONTRACT CONCEPT, PURPOSE OF FRAMEWORK CONTRACTS AND ECONOMIC FUNCTION
Özet: Social and economic needs change over time. It is quite important that legal rela-tions between individuals can be regulated flexibly in parallel with this change. The principle of freedom of contract, which dominates the Turkish legal system, and the freedom of type and content, which is a sub-view of it, serve to provide the desired flexibility in the field of law of contracts. Framework contracts take their legal basis from the principle of freedom of contract. Framework contracts are not contracts in the field of law of obligations and a subject about change of performance. Framework contracts take on a complementary role for future indi-vidual contracts dealing with the change of performance. Framework contracts, which are not subject to change in performance and are tasked with completing more than one individual contract, have some advanta-ges that can be said for all continuous debt relationships, since they first of all give rise to a continuous relationship between the counterparties. Beyond this, how the framework contracts take on the risk and uncertainty factors that may be encountered in a permanent debt relationship will be revealed by determining its economic function. In this study, the economic function of framework contracts will be tried to be revealed by making use of the sources for the economic analysis of law.

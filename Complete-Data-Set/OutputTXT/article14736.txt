Makale Başlığı: Reflections of the Sultan Murad V Period on the Vienna Press
Özet: The reign of Sultan Murad V, more precisely, the period of his accession to the throne was coincides in a periode, where the dignitaries struggled to prevent the collapse of the state. The superiority of the European great powers and Russia was obvious and the peoples within the empire fought for their independence. The application of European thoughts, order and management models were discussed and applied.  This transformation, which is required by the obligations, is a process that Austria, which is closely interested in the Balkans, also followed with interest. The communiqué known as the Andrassy Note, which was written by the Austrian Prime Minister Andrassy after the joint meetings of Germany, Russia and Austria, and asking for improvements in religion, worship and taxes of non-Muslim peoples, was given just before the reign of Sultan Murad V. The reflections of this short period on the vienna press, in which extremely active and uninterrupted events took place, will be tried to be conveyed in this article.  Because almost every day and quite comprehensive news about the period of Sultan Murad V has been made, it was not possible to include all of them. However, the Depositions and the Enthronements of the Sultans and the murders of the Ministers, the Ottoman-Serbian war and the constitutional debates from the basis of my work. Since it is not possible to peruse all the newspapers in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, only Vienna-based newspapers are included. It is possible to reach the newspapers mentioned in the study in the Austrian National Library Digital Archive.

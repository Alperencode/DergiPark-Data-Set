Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE MEDIATING EFFECT OF JOB SATISFACTION AND ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SOCIAL LOAFING OF COLLEAGUES AND THE LOAFING BEHAVIOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN HEALTH INSTITUTIONS
Özet: The aim of this study is to reveal the importance of social loafing behavior in health institutions and to examine the mediating role of job satisfaction and organizational commitment in the relationship between the individual's own social loafing and the social loafing of his colleagues. The research sample is 336 healthcare professionals working in a university hospital in Ankara. A questionnaire was used as a data collection tool in the study, and the data obtained from healthcare professionals were analyzed using IBM SPSS 21.0. In the research, hierarchical regression analysis was used to reveal the relationship between the social loafing behavior of coworkers and the individual's own social loafing behavior in health workers and to determine whether job satisfaction and organizational commitment have a mediating role in this relationship. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the social loafing of coworkers had a significant and positive effect on the social loafing of the individual, and that there was a partial mediation effect of job satisfaction in the relationship between the two variables, but it was concluded that organizational commitment did not have a mediating effect in this relationship.

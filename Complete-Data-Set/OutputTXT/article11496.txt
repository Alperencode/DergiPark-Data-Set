The aim of this study is to determine the vaccine hesitancy of citizens over the age of 18 and to investigate the Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in terms of various variables. The population of this descriptive quantitative study consisted of 385 participants, and the sample of citizens over the age of 18 living in Konya. Research data were collected through online platforms. The obtained data was analyzed with SPSS 20.0 statistical program. As a result, individuals who are against the Covid-19 vaccine do not see the coronavirus as a deadly disease; they are against Covid-19 vaccines mostly due to the side effects of vaccines, foreign production of vaccines, insufficient experimental studies, disbelief in protection, storage conditions, vaccine phobia, being against religious belief; It has been seen that most of the participants have partial knowledge about Covid-19 vaccines, and effective sources of information are social media, TV channels, academic publications, health authorities.

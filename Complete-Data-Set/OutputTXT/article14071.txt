Makale Başlığı: Banū Makhzūm From The Tribes of Quraysh And Its Position in the Historical Process
Özet: During the Age of Ignorance, the dominant understanding in the Arabian Peninsula was bigotry, and the reflection of this understanding in social life was tribalism. People had to belong to tribes of different status. Because the life of the people outside the tribe was always in danger. For this reason, the people who came to the region from outside were also looking for a way to enter the protection of a tribe in the first place. As a matter of fact, it is seen that the administrative duties are shared and there is no presidency in the Meccan society, which does not accept the leadership of any tribe. However, after the activities of Qusayy b. Kilāb, a significant weight of Quraysh stands out. Banū Makhzūm is one of the ten tribes of Quraysh. When the sources of Islamic history are examined, it is seen that the members of this tribe reacted differently to the invitation of Islam. For, just as there are those who are hostile to the Prophet, there are also those who support him. In this article, the attitude of the Banū Makhzūm tribe in the events starting from the period of ignorance and up to the post-Islamic period is discussed. Because the subject is important in terms of understanding the conditions of the period and the contact of the Islamic call with the understanding of tribalism. In accordance with the nature of the subject, descriptive, analytical and inductive methods were followed in the article.

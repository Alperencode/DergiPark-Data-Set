Makale Başlığı: Rereading the Concept of Security from a Sociological Perspective: Globalization, Migration, Covid-19 and Differentiating Perception of Security
Özet: The world is increasingly becoming a 'globalizing village'. This globalization has been the harbinger of prosperity as well as problems.  Political and humanitarian crises in many parts of the world are taking a chaotic form day by day. If we list the most important problems of today's global world: political instability, the phenomenon of migration arising from conflict and violence. Particularly, the covid-19 that emerged in 2019, which we left behind, has dragged the socio-economic life of the society from drama to drama. Millions of people on the move can infect each other with diseases that we have not even heard of. Marshall McLuhan's 'global village' metaphor best explains this situation. We have experienced this so-called 'global village', which continues to surround all societies without borders. The epidemic, known as Covid-19, which engulfs the whole world at the same time, has imprisoned people of all ages and groups within itself. The Covid-19 Pandemic can affect people from all walks of life in one way or another. Therefore, no matter what borders we draw or what walls we build, it seems that it is not possible to escape from this situation. The aim of this study is to rethink the events that have brought with it the global world, such as Migration, Covid-19, and similar events that leave deep traces in human life, with the perception of security that differs with the changing world order.

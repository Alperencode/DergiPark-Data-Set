Makale Başlığı: The Mind in Sufi Thought and Its Conceptualization in Ferîdüddîn Attâr’s Rubai Poems
Özet: Quatrain/rubai poetry generally illustrates philosophical and mystical thoughts in a concise way and has been a popular form of poetry among the mystic Sufi poets. Poets in the Persian literature can be found to have written rubai poems in their works, especially those known as diwans. Poets are also found to have written enough quatrain poetry to form a separate book consisting of poems solely in the form of rubai. Within this framework, the rubai poetry book Mukhtār-Nāma, one of the eight works confirmed to have belonged to the famous Iranian poet and Sufi Ferîduddîn Attâr (d. 618/1221) and composed of 50 chapters (called “sections”) in terms of the variety of subjects it contains, is an example.This study aims to evaluate philosophical and mystical thoughts in a linguistic and intellectual context with respect to the rubai poetic discourse and to analyze the concept of mind and the concept of partial mind, which Attâr independently discussed, through the sample of rubai poems selected from the Mukhtār-Nāma with the aim of the understanding the philosophical aspect of Ferîduddîn Attâr’s mystical thought.

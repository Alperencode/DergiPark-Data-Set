Makale Başlığı: One Novel, Two Styles: The French Lieutenant’s Woman
Özet: The French Lieutenant's Woman by John Robert Fowles can be said in a way to shed light on the development of novel in a century. The Victorian narrative style is side by side with the postmodern narrative style one hundred years later, and the difficulties of writing a Victorian novel from a century later are expressed by the author within the novel. The Victorian era and its socio-dynamic structure are depicted both with various epigraphs and through the narrative. Accordingly, attempts to write such a novel are clearly noted by emphasizing these difficulties from time to time and this dual approach is shared with the reader. While the main story progresses, the century-long adventure of novel is written within the Victorian elements. Apparently, there is the Victorian novel in which a postmodern novel comes into existence. It is possible to see both together. Fowles makes metafictional manipulations with the acceptances of the period and also embeds the novel's century-old progress into the story of The French Lieutenant's Woman. In short, while presenting the main story of the novel, Fowles successfully reveals the perfect harmony of the novel styles of two different eras.

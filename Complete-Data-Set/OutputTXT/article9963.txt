Makale Başlığı: EVALUATİON OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK PARAMETERS IN SOLAR RADIATION PREDICTION USING METEOROLOGICAL DATA
Özet: Accurate radiation prediction increases photovoltaic (PV) plant efficiency so ensures effective programming of the grid and improvement of power quality. This study demonstrates the prediction potential of artificial neural networks (ANN) parameters in global solar radiation through data from a meteorological measurement station established in Hakkari, Turkey, which is a solar-efficient place. The occurring simultaneous solar radiation values were estimated using the wind speed, temperature, pressure and humidity parameters obtained from the meteorology station depending on the time series, and the relationships between these parameters were modeled using ANN. The created model was tested with various training algorithms and activation functions, and the best result was tried to be obtained. The performance of this model was evaluated using statistical indicators. In prediction of solar radiation according to used data set parameters, the model established by using “trainlm” training algorithm and “poslin” activation function showed the best performance in solar radiation prediction with 0.97 regression value, 1.16% mean square error (MSE) and  0.0881% normalized root mean square error (nRMSE).

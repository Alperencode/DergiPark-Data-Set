Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Factors Affecting Motivation of Health Professionals Using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process Method
Özet: The aim of this study is to weight the factors affecting the motivation of health professionals according to the order of importance in line with the opinions of the participants and to rank these factors from the most important to the least important. The population of the research consists of health professionals working in a private hospital operating in Bandırma district of Balıkesir province, Turkey. Opinions of 62 health professionals were evaluated.  The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method was used to rank the motivation factors. It is seen that economic factors are the most important criteria on the motivation of health professionals than psychosocial and managerial and organizational factors. The sub-criterion with the highest priority among the economic factors criterion is "wage". When the psychosocial factors are evaluated, the criterion of "value and status" and “recognition” are important; among the managerial and organizational factors, the criterion of "fair and open management policy" was found to be more important on motivation. Based on these results it is suggested that in order to improve health professional motivation the wages can be improved and the further development of policy and practice that recognizes the value and status of the health professionals and fair and open management policy can be adopted.

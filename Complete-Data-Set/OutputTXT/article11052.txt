Makale Başlığı: From Photograph to Story: Documentary “enstANtane”
Özet: Emigration, a social phenomenon, has always found a place in books, articles and audio-visual media such as television and cinema. Oral history studies are of great importance in passing on the life stories of those who have endured significant events first-hand to future generations through the creation of social memory via direct narration. The present study relates the stories of Assyrians who had to migrate to Europe for various compelling reasons, and reveals the kind of changes emigration brought to their lives. For the study, a reading was made of the narratives of the people featured in the documentary enstANtane directed by Hakan Aytekin. The narratives of the people in the documentary about a photograph from the past, revealing how people tell their own stories, was examined with a descriptive analysis approach in line with the framework conceptualized by William L. Randall in The Stories We Are. The data set consists of information collected from the interviewees in the documentary. As the research involves examining data from an audio-visual documentary, an observation method was also utilized to document the interviewees’ emotions (excitement, smiling, crying, etc.). It was concluded from the study that the stories of the Assyrians who were compelled to migrate for various reasons share a common ‘longing for the past’.

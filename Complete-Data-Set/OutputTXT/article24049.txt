Makale Başlığı: AN UNKNOWN PEOPLE'S POET AŞIK MAHZUNI AND A CONK CONTAINING THEIR POEMS
Özet: Conks,  which are among the most significant written sources of Turkish folk literature, are accepted as works that must be obtained and evaluated when the materials they contain are taken into consideration. Despite the fact that numerous cönks have been brought to the literature until today, it is known that there are still many cönks in the hands of certain people that have not been opened for the use of researchers. In this study, a conk obtained from M. Mustafa Yılmaz, who kept the cönk belonging to his grandfather Aşık Mahzuni as "ancestral heirloom", was studied.Twenty-five diverse folk poems sung with syllabic meter are included in the conk. It has been determined that thirteen of the poems mentioned belong to Aşık Mahzuni and twelve of them belong to Emrah from Erzurum (Erzurumlu Emrah). In the study, the life of Aşık Mahzuni, who will cross the threshold of the Turkish folk literature for the first time, is given with the information obtained from the source persons, general information about the characteristics of the cönk is given and also the latinized text of the cönk has been submitted.

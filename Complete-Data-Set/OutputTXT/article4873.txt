However, as basic tools in measuring important parameters; female employees as employers, labor force participation, informality in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and the employment ratio of employees as family workers were examined. Besides, a situation assessment was made by considering variables such as part-time working, employment according to the occupational categories, and having children under three years old. As a result of the study, it was observed that the number of colleges, faculties, master's and doctoral graduates in Turkey is gradually increasing and Turkey is ahead in this sense compared to the EU 27 country group.While women have been observed to work usually in agriculture and part-time housework, they concentrate more on the service sector due to their cognitive skills. Depending on the working fields of women, it can be said that the labor force participation rate of women has reached half that of men in the last five years.

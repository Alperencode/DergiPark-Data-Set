Makale Başlığı: A CRITIQUE ON THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTRUER AS A TRANSCENDENT CONSUMER: FROM CONSUMER TO THEOSUMER
Özet: Consumer as a concept has acquired many different meanings in different times. The common feature of meanings is that they cannot transcend from subject-object dichotomy and cannot be constituted as a transcendent unity. In recent years, posthuman thought has prepared us for the idea of a transcendent being of unity that will keep subjectivity from this fragmentation. This transcendental being is defined as a concept of construer, which constitutes a transcendent being as a presentational mode of discourse in consumer behaviour literature. Based on these thoughts, the study’s central question is whether it is possible to constitute a conceptual constitution of the construer from the posthuman framework in terms of the theoretical constitution and theological grounds and, if possible, whether it is inclusively constituted. So, we criticize the construer concept regarding the theoretical constitution and theological grounds within the posthuman framework. We mentioned some of the theoretical and theological deficiencies of the construer, which seems to have been constituted in rational relation to the “conatus” in Spinoza’s Ethica. Finally, instead of construer, we propose the “theosumer” as a transcended consumer to constitute it as a unity, which we think is more inclusive in regarding theo-logia.

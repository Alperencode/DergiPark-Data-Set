Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Life Science Lessons with The Organic School Model on Primary School Third-Grade Students’ Science Process Skills and Attitudes Towards the Life Science Course
Özet: The aim of this study, which was carried out using the embedded design, is to examine the effects of life science lessons conducted with the organic school model on primary school third-grade students' science process skills and attitudes towards life science course. For this purpose, the change in students' scientific process skills and attitudes towards life science course was examined by using a single group pre-test post-test design in the quantitative part of the research. Then, focus group interviews were conducted to obtain in-depth information about the education experienced by the students. There were 19 students in the study group of the research. Quantitative data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. As a result, a statistically significant increase was observed in the students' scientific process skills and positive attitudes towards the life science course. In addition, it was observed that the students liked the organic school model, their stress levels were low during the lessons, and they especially enjoyed the activities they performed in nature. The results indicate that the physical learning environment in the organic school model contributes to the development of students' scientific process skills and their attitudes towards the lessons taught.

Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Turkey and Kosovo Secondary School Science Curriculum in the Context of  Chemistry Learning Area
Özet: In this study, Turkey and Kosovo secondary school science curricula were compared in the context of chemistry learning area and it was aimed to analyze the similarities and differences in terms of sub-learning areas, distribution of units according to grade levels, course hours, number of achievements, content and teaching techniques. In this study, in which document analysis, one of the qualitative rese-arch methods, was used, written and printed science programs of both countries were considered. As a result of the study, it is seen that the lower secondary education (secondary school) chemistry curricu-lum in Kosovo is numerically higher than the Turkish secondary school chemistry curriculum in terms of the distribution of units and units, course hours and achievements. In Turkey, at the secondary school level, chemistry is included in the natural science group, and the subjects include spiral learning, a low number of achievements, process-oriented constructivist and competency skills are tried to be gained. In terms of teaching techniques, partially similar techniques and methods are applied in both countries. Rapid advances in science and technology, occurring innovations and developments in the world are directly proportional to the higher quality of science education programs. In addition to this, it is thought that the participation of the Ministry of National Education's educational investments and projects in Kosovo within the scope of agreements between the two countries, which have historical and kinship ties with Turkey, and comparing the curriculum of Kosovo with the curriculum of develo-ping countries such as Turkey, will contribute to the curriculum of Kosovo by comparing the curriculum of Kosovo with the curriculum of developing countries such as Turkey.

Makale Başlığı: Sayf al-Dīn al-Āmidī’s Criticism on Mu‛tazila
Özet: In the tradition of Islamic thought, the historical memories of the sects are affected by the sects they are dealing with or opposed. In the historical process of Ash‛arism, its relationship with Mu‛tazila proceeds through the sectarian memory and the manifestations of the perception it causes. The process that started with Imam As‛harī's departure from Mu‛tazila in his forties brought the two sects into conflict. This research aims to evaluate the Ash‛arism's perception of Mu‛tazila in the Egypt-Damascus region through Sayf al-Dīn al-Āmidī. It focuses on the principle of deepening on the individuals used in the History of Islamic Sects research. Because the fact that al-Āmidī has a unique position within the framework of Egypt-Damascus Ash‛arism makes the criticism of Mu‛tazila even more important. Al-Āmidī gives place to the views of Mu‛tazila on many issues he examines and often criticizes it and sometimes finds it correct. While he sometimes generalizes and highlights the Mu‛tazila phenomenon in his criticisms, he sometimes includes Muʿtazilite scholars by name. At the forefront of al-Āmidī’s criticisms of Mu‛tazila are the issues related to the theory of knowledge. He puts forward a philosophical rationality against the Mu‛tazila rationalism. The second main field of al-Āmidī’s criticisms of Mu‛tazila is on theological issues. On the basis of this tension lies the imagination of God. Al-Āmidī’s criticisms of Mu‛tazila are fed by his philosophical background, Ash‛arī identity, and his original scientific approach.

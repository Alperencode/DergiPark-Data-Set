Makale Başlığı: Electrochemotherapy and Areas of Usage In Veterinary Medicine
Özet: Electrochemotherapy is an important and new local antitumoral treatment method that has been used in human medicine since the beginning of the nineties and has been used in veterinary medicine in recent years. The combination of electroporation and chemotherapy both minimized the high-level side effects of chemotherapy and managed to keep the cytotoxic efficiency of the chemotherapeutic drugs used at the maximum level. Electrochemotherapy applications have been applied in both human medicine and veterinary medicine according to the procedures of European standards since 2006. In veterinary medicine, electrochemotherapy has been used in the treatment of cutaneous tumors in cats, dogs, horses and in recent years, exotic animals. The aim of this review is to give information about this new technique by presenting the working mechanism of electrochemotherapy and its applications in veterinary medicine.

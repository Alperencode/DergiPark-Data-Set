Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF FRESH AND LYOPHILIZED BOZA ON BREAD QUALITY PROPERTIES
Özet: Boza, a functional traditional beverage, is a product obtained by fermenting grains. In this study, the use of different proportions of boza (25%, 50%, 60% on flour basis) and lyophilized boza (5%, 8%, 10% on flour basis) as a starter and their effects on the microbiological, chemical, textural and sensory properties of bread were investigated. The addition of boza was found to increase dough extensibility and resistance to extension compared to control bread. The proportions of fresh boza or lyophilized boza were  significantly correlated with the hardness of breads. In addition, the L value in boza added breads were significantly decreased compared with the control bread. It was determined that the lyophilization caused a significant decrease in lactic acid bacteria compared with yeast counts. The most acceptable group after the control bread was determined to be 25% fresh boza added bread and 5% lyophilized boza added bread.

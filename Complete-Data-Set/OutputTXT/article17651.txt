Özet: According to Turkish Civil Law the inheritance passes on the heirs ipso iure and universally [Turkish Civil Code (“TCC”) Art. 599]. The inheritance consists of rights and debts of the deceased. The heirs (statutory and/or appointed heirs) become the right holders and debtors without their will. By the death of the deceased, two separated assets that are general asset of an heir and special asset start existing together in the legal sphere of an heir. The special asset corresponds to the inheritance passed on which is subject to a special regime. Although the inheritance passes on the heirs, they shall not be forced to have rights or undertake obligations against their will.

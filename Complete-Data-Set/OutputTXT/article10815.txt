Makale Başlığı: Turkish Teachers' Use of Method Techniques and Opinions on Method Techniques
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine the use of the methods and techniques related to listening, speaking, reading and writing skills of Turkish teachers in the Turkish Lesson Curriculum (2006). Mixed method, in which quantitative and qualitative data were evaluated together, was used in the research. The sample of the study consists of 104 Turkish teachers working in Trabzon. Participants were determined by random sampling method. Quantitative data in the research were collected with the "Turkish Teachers' Use of Basic Language Skills Methods and Techniques Questionnaire" created in the digital environment. As a result of the research, it was determined that the free speech technique was mostly used by the teachers in speaking skill, as it allowed the students to express themselves more easily; In the listening skill, it was seen that the most participatory listening was preferred in order to ensure the active participation of the students in the lesson. On the other hand, reading aloud method is preferred by the teachers because it facilitates the recognition of the pronunciation disorders of the students and giving them feedback in reading skills; It has been determined that the free writing technique is used in writing skill as it allows students to write freely without limitations.

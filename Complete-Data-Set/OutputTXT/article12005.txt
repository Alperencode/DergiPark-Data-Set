Makale Başlığı: AN ASSESSMENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF FORENSIC ACCOUNTING AND TAX LAW
Özet: The aim of this study is to try to introduce the role of forensic accounting in tax-related cases by examining the tax-related issues of forensic accounting. The study was completed through literature review and was made as a compilation study. Although more than one definition of forensic accounting, which is the main element of the study, has been made, it is a rapidly developing field in the field of accounting, which is in the middle of law and accounting, with the use of accounting knowledge. One of the underlying reasons for most of the crime types defined as economic crimes, which is one of the research areas of forensic accounting, is to avoid paying taxes. This reason is hidden under economic crimes such as issuing false documents, financial manipulations, fraud and money laundering crimes. The forensic accountant will be able to assist those concerned in tax cases under the name of expert witness, litigation support consultancy and fraud auditing. Thus, the contribution of forensic accounting to the fair collection of taxes and its contribution to the budget of states is undeniable.

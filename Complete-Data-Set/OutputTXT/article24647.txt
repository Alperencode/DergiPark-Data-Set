Makale Başlığı: Abdals of Anatolia
Özet: The word“Abdal”, meaning dervish in both prose and verse, and also added either at thebeginning, or in front of the names of Folk Poets stating their pen names (i.e.Pir Sultan Abdal, Kaygusuz Abdal), is used in the different parts of Anatolia.Abdals, who originally belong to a Turcoman tribe that had to move to Anatoliato avoid the Mongol pressure, played a great role in spreading the Turkic andIslamic ideas throughout Anatolia. Since their arrival in Anatolia, somelimited researches have been made on their life-styles and their beliefs.Although it is found out that Abdals have had various forms of beliefs indifferent areas, they generally have led a life-style which shows similaritieswith the Alavi-Bektashi beliefs.

Özet: Since the existence of humanity, plants have been used in many treatment methods. Members of the genus Verbascum, also known as mullein, a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, have been evaluated for their traditional use against various ailments. In this study, the anticholinesterase and anticancer activities of Verbascum member Verbascum insulare Boiss. Et Heldr. collected from Muş region were investigated. V. insulare leaf ethanol (L-EtOH), leaf purified water (L-PW), root ethanol (R-EtOH), and root purified water (R-PW) extracts were obtained. The anticancer activity of the extracts against HT-29, MCF-7, and L-929 cell lines was examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test and the anticholinesterase activity was determined. It was found that the ethanol extract showed higher anticancer activity against cancer cell lines than the pure water extract and had more effective anticholinergic influences. No study has been found in the literature on the anticancer and anticholinesterase activity of this plant. Therefore, the results obtained from this study will contribute significantly to the development of herbal medicine in the future.

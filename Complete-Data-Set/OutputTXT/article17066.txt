Makale Başlığı: AN ASSESSMENT ON THE DYNAMICS GENERATING THE 1909 ADANA İĞTİŞAŞI
Özet: Abstract About a year after the proclamation of the Second Constitutional Monarchy, the violent incidents that took place between Muslims and Armenians in the Adana province were generally referred to in the recent literature as 1909 Adana İğtisaşı, despite various names. Although Adana province made progress in many aspects in the 19th century, it is possible to say that the socio-economic and political power struggles were effective in social polarization. These dynamics had a significant impact on the emergence of the 1909 Adana İğtişaş and the massive scale of the violence. As a result of the violence that gained a massive dimension, thousands of people lost their lives and many properties were plundered. In this study, the process leading to 1909 Adana İğtişaş will be examined, taking into consideration the socio-economic competition in the background of the violence that took place in Adana in the last period of the Ottoman Empire, the local power struggle, the activities of the Armenians, the effects of the Second Constitutional Monarchy in the region.

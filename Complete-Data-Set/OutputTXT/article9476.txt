Makale Başlığı: Treatment results of intensive care patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy
Özet: Aim: This paper aims to evaluate the treatment completion status and survival outcomes of patients who were prescribed radiotherapy during intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization in the radiation oncology clinic.Material and Method: Data on patients who underwent RT between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, in the Radiation Oncology Clinic of Ankara City Hospital were retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint of this study is the patient status at the completion of the planned radiotherapy and the secondary endpoint is the overall survival (OS). The data were recorded and analyzed using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).Results: The data of 11 patients who were indicated for radiotherapy while hospitalized for intensive care between May 20, 2020, and June 30, 2022, in the Ankara City Hospital Radiation Oncology Clinic were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up period from the onset of RT was 4.1 months (range 1–9.8). During this period, nine (81.8%) patients had deceased, and two (18.2%) patients were surviving. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range 3–70); four (36.4%) were female and seven (63.6%) were male. Seven (63.6%) of the patients completed the planned radiotherapy scheme and four (36.4%) did not complete the treatment. There was no significant relationship between the inability to complete the treatment and gender (p=0.194) or primary diagnosis (p=0.545). The median OS value of the patients was 4.1 months (range 1–9.8). In addition, the 1-month survival was 60.6%, and the 6-month survival was 20%. There was no significant relationship between OS and age (p=0.401; correlation coefficient: ‑282) or primary diagnosis (p=0.638). The median OS in women was 5.3 (range 2.7–9.8) months; the median OS in men was 1 month (range 1–5.5; p=0.059). The median OS of those who completed treatment was 4.5 months (range 1–9.8), while that of those who did not complete the treatment was 1.1 months (range 1–4; p=0.037).Conclusion: Approximately 60% of the patients who were hospitalized in the ICU and indicated for RT were able to complete treatment. A significantly higher OS was achieved in patients who completed the RT protocol. Criteria must be developed when determining the indications for radiotherapy of cancer patients hospitalized in intensive care.

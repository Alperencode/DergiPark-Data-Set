Makale Başlığı: Operational and Environmental Impact of Biodiesel on Engine Performance
Özet: The world presently is facing problem of crisis in fossil fuel and environmental pollution. Urbanisation, industrialisation and increasing population has led to steep rise in consumption of fuel all around the world. This indiscriminate usage of fuel has forced to think beyond conventional sources of fuel especially replacements of petroleum diesel and gasoline. Biodiesel in this case offers a great prospect. As biodiesel in derived mainly from bio materials like plants either edible or non-edible, it is very much reproducible. But due to high viscosity of these biodiesel they cannot be used directly for engine operation. Their blend with diesel can be used as fuel in engine without any modification in the engine. The aim of present paper is to study the impact of various biodiesel on engine performance. The study reveals that B20 biodiesel will be substitute to diesel as an alternative fuel. The result show that BSFC and BTE for B20 biodiesel is same as for diesel.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Eight-Week Plyometric Training on the Selected Physical and Physiological Parameters in Female Taekwondo Competitors
Özet: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 8-week plyometric training on selected physical and physiological parameters in female taekwondo competitors.In all, 24 female athletes, including 12 in the experimental group and 12 in the control group, who were studying in the School of Physical Education and Sports at Bartın University, were included in this study. The experimental group performed plyometric exercises for 3 days a week for 8 weeks. The control group continued their normal taekwondo training. The measurements were carried out before this study was started and after it was completed. The statistical data analysis was conducted using SPSS 16.0 software, and the independent samples t-test was used to compare the pretest-posttest mean scores of the experimental and control groups. The paired sample t-test was used to assess the pretest and posttest data within both the experimental group and the control group. The pretest and posttest comparisons of the experimental group for the anaerobic endurance test, flexibility test, leg strength test, back strength test, vertical jumping test, standing long jump, and grip strength test showed that the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). The pretest and posttest comparisons of the control group showed that there were statistically significant differences in endurance, leg strength, and back strength (p<0,05). In conclusion, this study found that the 8-week plyometric training contributed to the development of physical and physiological characteristics of female taekwondo competitors, and that the plyometric exercises were appropriate for taekwondo.

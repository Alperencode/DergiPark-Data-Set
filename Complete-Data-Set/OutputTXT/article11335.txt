Makale Başlığı: A Finite Difference Approximation for Numerical Simulation of 2D Viscous Coupled Burgers Equations
Özet: Many of the physical phenomena in nature are usually expressed in terms of algebraic, differential or integral equations.Several nonlinear phenomena playing a very important role in engineering sciences, physics and computational mathematics are usually modeled by those non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). It is usually difficult and problematic to examine and find out nalytical solutions of initial-boundary value problems consisting of PDEs. In fact, there is no a certain method or technique working well for all these type equations. For this reason, their approximate solutions are usually preferred rather than analytical ones of such type equations. Thus, many researchers are concentrated on approximate methods and techniques to obtain numerical solutions of non-linear PDEs. In the present article, the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional coupled Burgers equation (2D-cBE) has been sought by finite difference method based on Crank-Nicolson type approximation. Widely used three test examples given with appropriate initial and boundary conditions are used for the simulation process. During the simulation process,the error norms $L_{2}$, $L_{\infty}$ are calculated if the exact solutions are already known, otherwise the pointwise values and graphics are provided for comparison. The newly obtained error norms $L_{2}$, $L_{\infty}$ by the presented schemes are compared with those of some of the numerical solutions in the literature. A good consistency and accuracy are observed both by numerical values and visual illustrations.

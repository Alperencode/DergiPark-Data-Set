Makale Başlığı: OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTION AND SUBCONTRACTOR WORKERS' APPLICATIONS TO THE INSTITUTION AFTER TRANSITION TO STAFF
Özet: The Ombudsman Institution of the Republic of Turkey (KDK) is a constitutional public entity that can be applied before going to the judiciary, is free of charge, and decides within six months at the latest. In addition, due to its role as a mediator between the administration and the citizen, the Ombudsman Institution allows the applicants’ problems to be resolved through a friendly settlement, in many cases without even having to issue a recommendation. The Ombudsman Institution can audit the attitudes andbehaviours of the administrations, as well as administrative acts and actions, unlike the administrative judicial review empowered by special legal regulation. The institution conducts investigation not only on legislative audit but also equity and administration principles. Complaints can be filed confidentially atthe request of the applicant. By means of this advantage, workers working within the scope of subparagraph 4/d of the Civil Servants Law, who want to resolve disputes with the administration without applying to the judiciary have begun to apply the Ombudsman Institution. Examining the applications made to the KDK allows the identification of problem areas arising from the administration's transactions and actions. The subject of this study is the practice developed by the KDK against the applications related to the problems experienced by the public workers who were recruited and accepted as 4/d while working as a subcontractor in the public sector. Additionally, the approaches to solve the problems are examined.

Makale Başlığı: Transforming Waste Management Operations to Green Energy Initiatives:  Opportunities and Challenges
Özet: Emerging challenges for the landfill enterprises include the increasing difficulty in siting and permitting landfills, rising energy costs, and impending reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. A roadmap is presented to overcome these challenges as well as transform landfill operations to green energy initiatives. A feasibility study including financial analysis was performed for electric energy production from the captured landfill gas, solar-electric energy from closed landfill cells, and bioenergy from buffer and idle lands bordering the landfilling areas. While the landfill- and solar-electric energy options are economically viable, the bioenergy option requires due consideration of production capacity and tax credit and incentives. Returns on investment can provide sustainable solid-waste tipping fees, offset funding required for post-closure expenses, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without direct land-use change. Energy policies for carbon credits and tax incentives are critical elements to sustain the financing of green energy projects for the waste management industry.

Makale Başlığı: An Action Research on Developing Students' Connection Skills in Operations with Integers
Özet: The study group of this research, which aimed to develop the connection skill in operations with integers, consisted of 35 7th grade students selected by purposive sampling method. In the scope of the study, in which the action research model, one of the qualitative research approaches, was preferred since the researcher carried out a systematic study to solve a problem he observed in his own class, the test on connection skill in operations with integers and pre-post interview forms were used as data collection tools. In the light of the data revealing that mathematical association skills improved in operations with integers, the development of students in the dimensions of associating with daily life and associating between different representations of the concept was relatively more prominent. It was determined that the activities and models planned for the development of the connection skill were more effective especially in addition and subtraction. In this context, it is considered important to enrich the course materials for secondary school mathematics in general and integers in particular in terms of connection skill.

Makale Başlığı: The Evaluation of Aşık Mustafa Kurbanoğlu’s Love Poems in the Light of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory
Özet: Conceptual metaphor theory is the name of the theory that is based on cognitive semantics and deals with metaphor at the conceptual level. This theory, which found its expression in the literature in the work "Metaphors We Live By” published by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980, has been applied to both historical and contemporary dialects and important works of these dialects in Turkey in recent years. In this article, the love poems compiled by Âşık Mustafa Kurbanoğlu, one of the important names of the Kars minstrel tradition in the 21st century, were discussed and the love metaphors identified in these poems were examined in the light of conceptual metaphor theory. As a result of the one-to-one interviews with Âşık Mustafa Kurbanoğlu, as well as the research and observations made in the electronic environment, 193 poems were reached and it was determined that 27 of these poems were poems with the theme of love. The method called MIP (Metaphor Identification Procedure) developed by Pragglejaz Group was used while determining the metaphors on the love poems of the folk poet. As a result of this study, it has been seen that it is possible to apply the conceptual metaphor theory on folk poetry yields. In addition, the versatility of the love perception in Âşık Mustafa Kurbanoğlu's poems and the richness of the poet's understanding of love were revealed.

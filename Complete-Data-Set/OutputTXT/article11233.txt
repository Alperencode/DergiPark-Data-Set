Makale Başlığı: UZBEKISTAN’S FOREIGN POLICY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MIRZIYOYEV: STRUGGLE TO SUSTAIN AUTONOMY
Özet: This study explores Uzbekistan’s foreign policy during the presidency of Shavkat Mirziyoyev by focusing on its relations with the leading powers such as Russia, the United States (U.S.), China as well as the Central Asian Republics, and Turkey. The article argues that Uzbekistan, during the Mirziyoyev era continues to adhere to the multi-vectoral line in foreign policy whose main principles have been determined by the former President Islam Karimov. Yet, Mirziyoyev has also left his imprint on Uzbekistan’s foreign policy by reengaging with the Central Asian Republics through augmentation of diplomatic exchanges, organization of multilateral gatherings, resolution of border disagreements and resumption of transportation links. He also restored ties with Turkey, a significant regional power that presented new opportunities for Uzbekistan especially in the economic realm. The article also claims that the progressive decline of the U.S. impact in Central Asia in the wake of military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 and the growing apprehension in the region buttressed by the rapid Taliban takeover of Afghanistan may help Russia and China to play more dominant roles in Uzbekistan in security and economic domains which might undermine its endeavour to sustain autonomy in foreign policy.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect Of Food Preparation And Cooking Methods On Advanced Glycation End Products
Özet: Heat treatment of foods leads to the formation of various new compounds. They are harmful compounds such as heterocyclic amines, acrylamide and advanced glycation end products (İGSÜ). İGSÜs are associated with many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. İGSÜs are a large and heterogeneous group of compounds resulting from reactions between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. In recent years, unhealthy nutrition and sedentary life has increased significantly. This leads to an increase in the production of exogenous İGSÜ and endogenous production. The aim of this study is to draw attention to the negative effects of İGSÜs on health and to inform individuals about healthy food preparation and cooking methods.

Özet: The aim of the study is to determine the effect of professional solidarity perception on internal motivation among accountants. For this purpose, a survey study is conducted on 190 professional accountants working in Isparta. Two scales, namely professional solidarity and internal motivation are used in the survey study. The study of Yücel Batmaz and Gürer (2016) is used on internal motivation, and the scale of professional solidarity on accountants is obtained by using Çetinkaya Uslusoy (2010) and various other studies on professional solidarity. Factor analysis, t test, One-Way Anova, Mann-Whitney U, correlation and regression analyzes are applied on the data obtained from the research. As a result of the factor analysis, 4 dimensions on professional solidarity and 1 dimension on internal motivation are obtained. In the 4 hypotheses created, the benefits of professional solidarity, which are the sub-dimensions of professional solidarity, the importance given to professional solidarity, the perception of professional solidarity of professional chambers and the effects of obstacles in front of professional solidarity on the internal motivation dimension are investigated. As a result of hypothesis tests; it is concluded that the importance given to professional solidarity by professional accountants and professional accounting chambers affects the internal motivation of accountants.

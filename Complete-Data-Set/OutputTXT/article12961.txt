Makale Başlığı: An Andalusian Maliki Scholar, Ibn al-Fars and His Work, Ahkam al-Qur’an
Özet: The purpose of this study is to introduce and analyze Ahkam al-Qur’an, penned by Ibn al-Faras, who flourished as a scholar in Andalusia’s city of science, Granada, around the 6th century after Hijra. The essay focuses on the method the author has employed in treating ‘the verses containing rulings’ (ayat al-ahkam) in this work, which he has composed in the form of judicial exegesis. The author’s exegetical method has been identified and determined mainly through the analysis of the Ahkam al-Qur'an –his only surviving work to the present day- and also through the examination of the studies that have been made on this work, even if they are limited in number. This paper deals with the life of the author, the sources and contents of his work, as well as the methodology he has used in his work. It has been observed that the author who belonged to the Maliki legal school has interpreted the verses containing rulings according to the views of Imam Malik, although he appears to have also accepted, without any reservation, the views of the other legal schools whenever he deems their evidences to be strong. Besides, on certain issues he has preferred his own personal views over the reports of the past. In this specific work, which contains certain subjects about the sciences of the Qur’an (Ulum al-Qur’an), one might as well find the examples of  both types of exegesis; that of narration (riwayah) and that of comprehension (dirayah).  There has been no entry for Ibn al-Faras in the current edition of the TDV Encyclopedia of Islam. Therefore, we certainly believe that the inclusion of this scholar in the complementary volumes to be added to the TDV Encyclopedia will be very useful for those who wish to do scientific researches in this field.

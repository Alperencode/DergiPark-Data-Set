Makale Başlığı: The Effect of the Patriarchal System on Female Athletes
Özet: The aim of the research is to examine what women athletes experience in terms of turning to sports in a patriarchal structure. The study was designed as a qualitative research. The data were collected with a semi-structured interview form and 7 people were included in the research. The findings of the athletes participating in our research were examined in three main lines. These are: Family Support-Disability, Success Against Sports Disability and Social Negativities. As a result of the research, it was determined that the first support of female athletes should be support from the family and the father figure in the family in patriarchal societies. The reason for this is that individuals who earn income in patriarchal structures are the father figures in the family. In addition, as another result of our research, the reason why the athletes cause social pressure because of their clothes is the thought that they did not adopt the culture specific to the branch. Finally, suggestions are presented to shed light on scientists for the future of patriarchal sports society research.

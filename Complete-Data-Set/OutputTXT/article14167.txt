Makale Başlığı: Construction of Woman on News: The Case of Afghan Women
Özet: Although the contents produced by developed countries on the presentation of women in the media are mostly similar, they can differ in terms of both religion and ethnicity. This study has been prepared to determine how Afghan women were handled in the Turkish press after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on August15, 2021. In the study, from the start date of the event to 27.11.2021; "yenisafak.com.tr", "sozcu.com.tr" and "hurriyet.com.tr" internet newspapers are limited to the news scanned by writing the keywords "Afghan" and “women”. Van-Dijk News Discourse Analysis was preferred as the method in the study, which was completed with a total of 90 news by reaching 26 news on "yenisafak.com.tr", 11 news on "sozcu.com.tr" and 53 news on "hurriyet.com.tr". As a result of the analysis of the news of Sözcü, the concerns about Afghan women and the lack of life safety were discussed with comments; as a result of the examination of the news of the Yenisafak, it was concluded that the news of the newspaper mostly produced on the subject of "Afghan women" was produced with the meaning that women are not in danger and that the Western media draws the dangerous atmosphere in question; as a result of the analysis of the news in the Hürriyet, it was observed that, in general, the news produced by the newspaper for "Afghan women" reproduced the meaning that women were ignored in education and business life and imprisoned at home, despite the statements that the "Taliban would follow different and egalitarian policies in their decisions towards women.

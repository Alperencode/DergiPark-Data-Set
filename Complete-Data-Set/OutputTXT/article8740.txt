First of all, in residential areas, the positioning of the dwellings on the site plan is the most effective primary step to reduce and increase the natural impact of the sun on the buildings. Utilization of solar energy with effective and active methods in the design of residential buildings, depends on taking this first step correctly. The aim of this article is to evaluate the passive effect of the sun on the positioning of houses and blocks of flats in the design of residential areas. Therefore, in thise article; The relationships between design parameters regarding the optimal utilization of passive effect of the sun as orientation of the buildings, the sun shine duration, the distances between the buildings and the slope of the terrain have been firstly held. Then a selected pilot residential area has been evaluated with regard to these parameters.

Makale Başlığı: THE INFLUENCE OF PRE-PLANT TREATMENTS ON SILAGE MAIZE (Zea mays L.) YIELD IN NO-TILLAGE SYSTEM
Özet: No-tillage agricultural practices and pre-plant applications in agricultural systems have become quite commonin recent years. In this study, the effect was examined of pre-plant applications on agronomic characteristicsand yield in silage maize cultivation under no-tillage conditions. Plants of the forage legumes (common vetch,narbon vetch and fodder pea) and cereals (barley, triticale and annual ryegrass) were used as pre-plantsmaterials and the values of plant height, green herbage yield, dry matter ratio, dry matter yield, leaf/stemratio, peak tasselling time and core tasselling time were determined in silage maize. The data obtaineddemonstrated, that the green herbage yield and dry matter yield of maize was higher when the forage legumeplants were used as pre-plants. Among the legumes, common vetch increased maize green herbage yield anddry matter yield more than other plants. On contrast, plants of the in cereals family caused a decrease in themaize yield. It was concluded that legume plants should be selected as pre-plant in no-tillage silage maizecultivation. Good results were obtained especially from common vetch, and the use of cereals as pre-plant hada negative effect on the maize for silage grown subsequently.

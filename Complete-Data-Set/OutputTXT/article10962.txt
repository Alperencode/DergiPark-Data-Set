Makale Başlığı: The Exploitation of Phenomena Related to Enunciation in a French as a Foreign Language Course Book: The ÉditoExample
Özet: This   study   aims   to   examine   certain   phenomena   concerning   enunciation   and   draw  from  there  the  didactic  implications  in  the  scope  of  the  exploitation  of  these  phenomena  in  a  French  as  a  Foreign  Language  course  book.  More  specifically,  we  attempt  to  raise  the  question  about  enunciative  phenomena  transmission  related  to  the  expression  of  opinions  within  part  of  a  chapter  from  the  Édito  B2  course  book.  To  enable  this,  we  proceed  in  terms  of  phenomena  such  as  enunciative  dimensions,  shifting  markers,  modality  markers,  enunciative  management  markers and  polyphony.  From  our  point  of  view,  these  phenomena  require  the  consideration  of  the  following  elements:  shifted/non  shifted  levels,  shifters  of  person/ostension,  modalities  of  enunciation/utterance  and  polyphonic  markers  of  point  of  view. Methodologically, these elements thus constitute our analysis grid. The analysis of the list of utterances recommended by the course book concerning the expression of opinions leads us to the following findings: Firstly, the 1st/2nd-person pronouns/possessive  adjectives,  the  demonstrative  pronoun  ça  and  the  presentative  c’est  undertake  the  shifting  function.  Secondly,  whereas the modalities of enunciation are related to assertion, interrogation, and exclamation, it is possible to identify certain specific speech  acts  regarding  the  expression  of  opinion.  Thirdly,  with  regard  to  the  modalities  of  utterance,  subjectivity  is  ensured at the lexical level, especially through the use of certain opinion verbs and attributive adjectives. Lastly, while some markers of point of view in the form of prepositional locutions are utilized for the management of enunciation, they essentially contribute to polyphony.

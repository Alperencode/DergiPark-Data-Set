Makale Başlığı: Is FiLaCTM the Ideal Choice for Initial Treatment of Anal Fistula as a  Minimally Invasive Treatment Option?
Özet: Aim: The laser method (FiLaCTM) has recently emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option in the treatment of anal fistula. Anal incontinence and fistula recurrence after anal fistula surgery are postoperative problems that complicate the treatment. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the film method in the treatment of anal fistula and in which cases it should be preferred in the treatment.Methods: Twelve patients who underwent FiLaCTM diode laser at Derik State Hospital between July 2017 and August 2018 were included in the study. Patients were analyzed retrospectively in terms of age, gender, development of incontinence, recovery and return to work, fistula types, MRI findings, and complications.Results: 11 of the patients included in the study were male and 1 female and the mean age was 46. Intraoperative complications were not observed in any of the patients. The mean follow-up period was 13.5 (7-19) months. Complete recovery was observed in 4 (33.3%) patients in the follow-ups of the patients, while no improvement was achieved in 8 (66.7%) patients.Conclusion: The FiLaCTM procedure for the treatment of anal fistula is a safe, minimally invasive, sphincter-sparing treatment option with low efficacy. However, it can be preferred as an initial treatment in high-level fistulas and in patients who want minimally invasive intervention.

Makale Başlığı: Family and Religion in a Humanless World: A Transhumanist Perspective
Özet: In the historical process, family and religion are supportive of one another, even needy to one another. The family became the bearer of religious values, while religion protected the family by sanctifying. In doing so, they have secured the survival of social life and of themselves. However, secularization has reduced the influence of religion on individual and social life. This process is promoted by transhumanism, a socio-cultural movement that has increased its fans and is getting stronger, especially since the beginning of the 21st century. Because transhumanism, unlike religions, is driven by the assumption that man is a flawed creation and therefore needs to be developed physically and spiritually. It has a mindset that sees the use of all kinds of technologies as necessary and compulsory, which gives man a painless, comfortable, and long life in this world. Thus, the adoption of the values espoused by transhumanism means the transformation of religion and all traditional structures powered by religion. In this study, the transformations which the Turkish family structures both experience and are likely to experience will be discussed from the perspective of transhumanism. The main purpose of the study is to demonstrate both the current and future impacts of the global value atmosphere, which has contributed to the spread and transformation of the transhumanist movement, on the Turkish family.

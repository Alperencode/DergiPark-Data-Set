Makale Başlığı: THE HISTORY AND CAUSES OF RHYTHM AND VALUES IN AZERBAIJAN FOLK MUSIC
Özet: In Azerbaijan musicology, rhythms and values used in folk music in the XX century from ancient times to the present have not been studied in detail. Considering the importance of this subject in music theory, it is necessary to shed light on this field of musicology. The importance of rhythm in the art of music is very great in the creation of the first human being. I think that the history of rhythm is connected with the history of creation of the first man.The aim of the article is to show the important role of rhythms in folk music civilization, about the creation, history and importance of rhythmic formulas in Azerbaijani music creativity.In this study were used historical analysis, literary criticism and document analysis, which are qualitative scientific research methods.Therefore, in our article, I wanted to draw attention to the causes of rhythm, its existence in the universe, its role in human life and in the art of music. We need to emphasize that this issue is in the context of the theoretical problems of Azerbaijani folk music.Rhythmic forms which have an important role in the formation of Azerbaijani music art are indicated in three ways: folk music, folklore genres, the structure of syllables in speaking time and mugham (maqam) originate from the minstrel arts.

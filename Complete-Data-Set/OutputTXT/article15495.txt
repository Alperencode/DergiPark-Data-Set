Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT PHOSPHORUS DOSES ON SEED YIELD AND QUALITY PARAMETERS OF BLACK CUMIN (Nigella sp.)
Özet: Phosphorus is an important element that affects the generative development, seed and fruit quality of plants. This study was carried out in the ecological conditions of Kahramanmaras province to determine the effects of different phosphorus doses on the vegetation, yield, and quality characteristics of black cumin. The experiment was carried out in the field of “Field Crops Research and Application Department of Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Faculty of Agriculture” in the winter growing seasons of 2017-18 and 2019-20, according to the split plots in randomized blocks as 3 replications. Two Nigella genotypes, one of which is a registered variety (Cameli variety), and five different P doses (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 kg da-1) were used in the study. According to the research findings, while phosphorus doses did not have a significant effect on plant characteristics such as plant height, number of branches, number of capsules, it was determined that it affected the number of seeds in the capsule and seed yield. The highest number of seeds per capsule (128.23 per capsule-1) was obtained from the highest P (12 kg da-1) application, and the highest seed yield (136.04 kg da-1) was obtained from the 6 kg da-1 P application. Significant differences were observed in doses and genotype × dose interaction in terms of quality characteristics.

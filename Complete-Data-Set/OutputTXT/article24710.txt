Makale Başlığı: Effects of Nutrition Education on General Health and Nutrition Status of Pregnant Women
Özet: Nutrition education improves maternal nutrition and reduces the risk ofpoor health outcomes in both mothers and their children. The relationship between maternal nutrition education andmother's nutritional knowledge score, dietary habits, food consumption andhealth status (hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood pressure and body weight gain)were the subject of investigation in this study. This study has been conducted by random sampling on150 low income pregnant women between the ages of 18-35, in interventionand control groups. Data was collected at an initial interview and again at afinal interview after two nutrition education programs.There were significantincreases in the nutritional knowledge score and mean intake of calcium, iron,vitamin A and weight gain in the intervention group (p<0.05),also increaseson mean intake of energy, protein and vitamin C. Hemoglobin and hematocritlevels in the intervention group did not appear to be influenced by thenutrition education. The results indicatethat nutrition counseling during pregnancy can improve dietary intake andmaternal weight gain.

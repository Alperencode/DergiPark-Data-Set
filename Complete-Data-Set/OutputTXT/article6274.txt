Makale Başlığı: Scrutinization of Potential Concern in Estimating Hydrological Design Parameter in Changing Climate Conditions
Özet: Traditional approaches considered in estimating the design parameters of hydraulic structures assume that the data to be used in the analysis is stationary. However, the assumption of stationary has lost its validity, as the normal functioning of the hydrological cycle is deteriorated by climate change. Furthermore, the estimation of the required design parameter for hydraulic structures under non-stationary conditions would be evidence of failure for the structure in question. The aim of the study was to come up with what the regional frequency distribution characteristic of maximum rainfall with 2-h duration for the Euphrates-Tigris river basin would differ under non-stationary conditions. For this purpose, ITA and PITA approaches were used. Trends were detected in approximately 83% of the maximum rainfall series, with increasing variation in 80% of this amount. In order to reveal the variability in the regional frequency distribution of all rainfall series, the L-moments algorithm was applied to the data series of the first halve and second halve formed by the ITA method. It was found that remarkable differences were detected in the quantiles obtained for some risk levels.

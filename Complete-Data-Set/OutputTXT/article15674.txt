Makale Başlığı: UNDERSTANDING THE TRANSFORMATION OF HOUSING FOCUSING ON CONSUMPTION AND MEDIA
Özet: Among the dominant study topics in the fields architecture and design, housing spaces have recently become the major subject among various study fields such as investment, economy, and this has not only undergone a stylistic change but also a notional transformation by being placed on an interdisciplinary spot. Having started with the adventure of belonging to a place, although this adventure has been matched with special concepts such as privacy, belonging, and special space, it has evolved into objects designed and introduced independent of the user during this process. When this subject transformation is considered in the historical process of Turkey, it is clearly seen during and after the changes experienced in political and economic policies of 1980s. It would be true to state that the major objective of approaches that view everything as objects is creating a society of consumerism. The media have provided the biggest support in adapting the society to consumption.. In this context, how the media have played a role in introducing houses as objects of consumption over time has been mentioned. This study investigates this subject focusing on consumption and media in parallel to the changes experienced in a multifaceted context by getting beyond the interpretation of the transformation of housing spaces solely through an architectural perspective.

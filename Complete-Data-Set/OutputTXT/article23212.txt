Makale Başlığı: A Preliminary Study on the Cultivation of Brown Seaweed Sargassum cristaefolium Using Fixed-off Bottom and Raft Methods
Özet: Sargassum is a great source of alginate, a phycocolloid with vast uses in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical areas. Hence, the cultivation techniques of this species need special attention and are worth investigating. In this study, a preliminary study on the cultivation of Sargassum cristaefolium was carried out in coastal water of Pasiagan, Bongao, Tawi-Tawi, southern Philippines, using fixedoff bottom and raft methods with two types of seedlings (T1 = with holdfast and T2 = vegetative cutting). Results revealed that the specific growth rate (SGR) of T1 (-1.51±0.6% day-1 ) and T2 (- 2.03±0.23% day-1 ) in the fixed-off bottom method did not significantly differ (p>0.05) after 45 days of culture. In raft method, SGR of T1 (1.5±0.12% day-1 ) and T2 (1.12±0.40% day-1 ) did not significantly vary (p>0.05) after 45 days. The survival rate of T1 (43.33±6.67%) was greatly higher (p>0.05) than T2 (13.33±3.33%) after day 45 cultured in the fixed-off bottom method. However, the survival rate of T1 (30.01±15.27%) and T2 (16.68±12.01%) did not differ significantly in the raft method. This study suggests that both seedling types can be used in raft method for Sargassum cultivation. This study would serve as preliminary information on the cultivation of Sargassum in Tawi-Tawi, southern Philippines.

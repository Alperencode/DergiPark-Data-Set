Makale Başlığı: Geological Investigation of Lead Mineralization Associated with Silicified Zone in Büyük Kızılcık (Göksun-K.Maraş) Region
Özet: The interrelated stacks outcrop in Eastern Taurus which occurred in different environment and tectonic conditions each other. These stacks located from the elderly to young at the bottom Upper Jurassic-Cretaceous aged peridotites, banded gabbro, isotropic gabbro and plate-dike complex, Kömürhan Ophiolites and metamorphic rock units of Bodrum Napa. Kömürhan Ophiolites and Bodrum Napa cut by late Cretaceous aged Baskil Granodiorites. Alteration zones associated with mineralization are observed inside of the units which have been cut by Baskil Granodiorites. Pyrite, sphalerite, galenite, arsenopyrite, magnetite and hematite were detected in ore microscopy studies. In the isotope analysis performed on the pyrite sample, the δ 34S value was determined as -3 %o. In the fluid inclusion analysis performed on quartz minerals, the epithermal formation temperature was determined between 69-127 °C and an average of 103 °C. While the primary origin of the mineralizations in the study area is formed as a sulfide bedding located in fault and fracture crack systems developed in metamorphic rocks with the effect of acidic volcanism affecting the region since Miocene. It is thought that secondary mineralizations are deposited in discontinuity zones formed as a result of tectonic events by dissolving primary sulfide minerals.

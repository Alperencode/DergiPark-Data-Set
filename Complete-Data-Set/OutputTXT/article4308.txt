Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Learning Methods Chosen in Accordance to the 4 MAT Learning Styles on The Achievements of The Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers in Open Ended Problem Solving
Özet: The purpose of this study is to reveal the effect of the learning methods chosen in accordance with the 4MAT learning styles on the open-ended problem solving success of pre-service mathematics teachers and the sub-steps of data, model, solution and development of problem solving. In the study, the pretest-posttest single-group experimental method was used.The participants of the study consisted of pre-service mathematics teachers. As a data collection tool, open-ended problems asked in the midterm and end-of-term exams, which include derivation-related acquisitions, were used. In the evaluation of open-ended problems, it was obtained with the help of a rubric developed by the researchers, which includes the steps of collecting data, modeling, solving the modeling and expanding the problem. With the analysis of the data of the study, it was concluded that the learning methods chosen in accordance with the 4MAT learning styles had an effect on the success of pre-service mathematics teachers in open-ended problem solving, and on the data, model, solution and development steps from the problem solving steps. Almost all of the pre-service mathematics teachers in the data step, which is the first stage of problem solving, and almost all in the model solution and development steps, which are the other steps of problem solving, showed improvement. The improvement shown by the pre-service mathematics teachers, who have been accustomed to being successful in knowledge and procedural tests for years, despite the open-ended questions they are not familiar with, is an indication that they will be open to development in their profession in the future, and therefore they will be successful.

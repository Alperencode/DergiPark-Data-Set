Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT of OMEGA 3, 6,9 and STEARIC ACID on TRACE ELEMENTS in ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION-INDUCED HEART TISSUE in a RAT HIND LIMB MODEL
Özet: In this study, the effect of omega fatty acids (3, 6, 9) and stearic acid on some trace elements (Cu, Mn and Zn) in heart tissue, which is a distant organ, by creating ischemia/reperfusion in the hind legs of rats was investigated. Animals were divided into ten groups: Control (C), I/R, I/R+Omega 3, I/R+Omega 6, I/R+Omega 9, I/R+stearic acid, omega 3, omega 6, omega 9 and stearic acid groups. I/R was applied to the right hind legs of I/R, I/R+omega 3, I/R+omega 6, I/R+omega 9 and I/R+stearic acid groups under anesthesia. In this study, the levels of Cu, Mn and Zn elements were studied in samples obtained from heart tissue in animal models divided into ten groups using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) device. Compared to the control group, heart tissue’s Cu and Zn levels were low, Mn levels were high but not important in the ischemia group (p>0.05). When ischemia and omega 3, 6, 9 and stearic acid applied groups were compared with the ischemia group, heart tissue’s Cu level was found to be low and Mn level was higher, but this result was not important (p>0.05). Compared to the ischemia group, heart tissue’s Zn levels were found to be notably higher in omega 6+IR, omega 9+IR and stearic acid groups (p<0.05). As a result, I/R application changes trace element levels in heart tissue, which is a distant organ. In the case of I/R, omega fatty acids and stearic acid treatment may provide a protective effect by improving trace element levels.

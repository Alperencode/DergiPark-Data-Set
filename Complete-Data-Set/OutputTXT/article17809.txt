While no significant difference was found according to whether the classroom teachers were in-service or not, a significant difference was observed in favor of those who played an instrument or not. In the study, linear regression analysis was conducted on the level of self-efficacy of classroom teachers regarding music education explaining their attitudes towards music education. As a result of the analysis, it was seen that the self-efficacy of the classroom teachers about music education explained their attitudes towards music education at the level of 35%.

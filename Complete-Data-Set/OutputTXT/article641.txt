Makale Başlığı: Entertaining Characters in Classical Turkish Literature: Dancers, Musicians and Dancing Boys
Özet: It is a known that all societies have had a relationship with dance throughout history. In Turkish society, the origin of the dance dates back to the Shamans, independent of gender. In the Ottoman era, non-religious dancers were called çengi, köçek, tavşan/tavşanoğlanı, kasebâz, curcunabâz, cin askeri, beççegân, çeganebâz and çârpârezen. Among these nomenclatures, the most common literary terms were çengi (dancer/musician) and köçek (dancing boy). People who dance extravagantly to music were called çengi or köçek. While all dancers were called çengi, regardless of their gender in the old texts, later on, women were called çengi and men were called köçek. There is no clear date for this transformation on record.Information on dancers in general, and çengi and köçek in particular, could be found in travel books, surnâmes or the works of the authors of the period. The current paper aims to discuss the terms köçek and çengi, theatrical plays that became common with the encouragement and support of the Ottoman palace, including the reflections of these performing arts in classical Turkish poetry. Furthermore, “Köçek Süleyman”, mentioned in the Divan of Rodoscuklu Kömürkayâzâde Fennî, a poet of the 19th century, and a new name in the history of köçek at the time, was addressed. Thus, the study aims to emphasize to the poet's employment of the social approach to entertainment in his poetry and classical Turkish literature.

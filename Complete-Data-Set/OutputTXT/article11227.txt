Makale Başlığı: Association of the changes in pulmonary artery diameters with clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection: A crosssectional study
Özet: Objective: Enlarged pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) can be associated with mortality risk in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)patients. Our aim is to find the factors that cause changes in PAD and the relationship between radiological findings and clinicaloutcomes in COVID-19 patients.Patients and Methods: In this descriptive, retrospective, and single centered study, among the hospitalized 3264 patients, 209 patientswith previous chest computed tomography (CT) were included. Findings of current chest CTs of patients obtained during COVID-19were compared with that of previous chest CTs. Pulmonary involvements, World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical ProgressionScale scores and laboratory variables were recorded. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, intubation and mortality were clinicaloutcomes that were evaluated by using uni – and multivariate analyses.Results: Patients with high D-dimer had significantly increased risk for enlarged PAD and increase in PAD compared to previouschest CT (ΔPAD) (OR=1.18, p<0.05, OR=1.2 p<0.05). Both high D-dimer and an increase over 2 mm in PAD (ΔPAD 2mm) hadsignificant risks for ICU admission, intubation, and mortality (OR= 1.18 p<0.01, OR=1.22 p<0.01, OR=2.62 p<0.05, OR=2.12 p<0.01,OR=2.32 p<0.01, OR=2.09 p<0.001 respectively). It was found that with enlarged PAD, risk of ICU admission and mortality increased.(OR=3.03 p<0.001, OR=2.52 p<0.01). Combined with age and lymphocyte counts, PAD predicted mortality with a 50% sensitivity,88% specificity (AUC=0.83, p<0.001).Conclusion: PPatients with an increase over 2 mm (ΔPAD 2mm) in PAD had significantly increased clinical severity, ICU admission,intubation, and mortality. High levels of D-dimer and CRP in patients suggest that increased inflammation and thrombosis may beeffective in pathogenesis.

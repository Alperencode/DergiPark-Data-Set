Makale Başlığı: Genoprotective Role of Purslane Methanol Extract Against Somatic Mutations Induced by Bifenthrin, a Third Generation Prethyroid Insecticide
Özet: In this study, in vitro and in vivo genotoxic effects of Bifenthrin (BIF), an important insecticide used in agricultural production, storage and processing, were investigated. The genoprotective properties of purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) against the genotoxic effects of BIF were also determined by using the methanol (POmet) extract of this plant. In vivo experiments were performed with somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. In in vitro studies, human peripheral blood cultures were prepared and different concentrations of BIF were applied to lymphocyte cells in accordance with the procedure of both the micronucleus (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay. The results obtained from all applied tests showed that BIF is genotoxic and induces chromosomal mutations. Later, another experiment was conducted and it was determined that the genotoxic effects of BIF were reduced with POmet (1:1 v/v). This result, which was observed in all in vivo and in vitro tests, shows that purslane plant is a potent radical scavenger. Due to the healing properties of POmet, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS) method was used to determine the components in its content. Some of the components found in the highest ratio in this extract are γ-sitosterol (21.86%), 13-docosenamide, (13.30%), palmitic acid (12.85%), stigmasteol (6.64%), campesterol (5.69%), linoleicacid (5.46%) and 2-methyl-1-hexadecanol (3.88%).

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of 1H, 1'H-3,3'-Biindazole on Some Biochemical Parameters in Rats
Özet: Indazoles are important compounds for chemistry and pharmacology. This study aimed to investigate the amount of antioxidant vitamins (A, E, C), Se, MDA and GSH-Px enzyme activities in the blood serum liver and kidneys of rats the 1H,1'H-3,3'-biindazole injected into rats for certain periods. Amounts of selenium in serum, liver and kidney samples were determined by fluorimetric method, A, E, C, and MDA levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). GSH-Px enzyme activity amounts of erythrocytes were measured by spectrophotometric method. In our experimental results, it was observed that the levels of vitamins A, E, C, and Se were generally lower than the control group, maximum increase in the amount of GSH-Px enzyme activity in the 3rd injection period and the activities in the other injection periods were higher than the control group. It was determined that levels of decreased vitamin A, E, C, and Se while increased of levels MDA and GSH-Px enzyme activity. It has been determined that these medicinal substances used in the treatment of many diseases are vital; however, it causes oxidative stress in metabolism. It has been concluded that it may be useful beneficial of supplements antioxidant vitamins and selenium in the use of drugs containing these substances.

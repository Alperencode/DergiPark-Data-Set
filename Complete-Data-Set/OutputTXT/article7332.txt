Makale Başlığı: Comparison of 5th to 8th Grade Mathematics Curricula in Turkey and Greece
Özet: This study compares the Turkish secondary school mathematics curriculum and the 5-8th grades mathematics curriculum in Greece, which has an essential place in the history of mathematics in terms of their general structure and content (learning areas, sub-learning areas, achievements, and course hours). In this study, we have used the document analysis method and curricula as a data collection tool. As a result of the research, we have seen that although the Turkish mathematics curriculum is structured as a single document, the Greek mathematics curriculum has a detailed document covering the aims, general objectives, and basic concepts of the interdisciplinary approach. While primary school is 6 years and secondary school is 3 years in Greece, both are 4 years in Turkey. The number of achievements in the Greek mathematics curriculum is higher than in Turkey, but the course hours are less than in Turkey. In addition, sets, linear equations, and similarity learning areas are included in the Turkish curriculum, but not in Greece. Similarly, sub-learning areas such as Functions and Trigonometry are included in the Greek curriculum, but not in Turkey. In line with these results, it can be ensured that the mathematics course hours are different at each grade level, and the course hours increase as the grade level increases in the mathematics curriculum conducted in Turkey, as in the Greek mathematics curriculum. In addition, as in previous curricula, a broader curriculum including activities, educational materials, and mathematical illustrations that will contribute to students' understanding of the subject can be developed in line with re-achievements.

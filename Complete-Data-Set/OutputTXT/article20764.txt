Makale Başlığı: The Free Radical Scavenging Activity of Crithmum maritimum L. from the Blacksea Cost
Özet: Objective: There is a great deal of research on nutraceuticals and natural compounds obtained by plant extraction to promote health and reduce disease risk. Crithmum maritimum L. (C. maritimum) from Apiaceae family, also known as the sea fennel, is edible halophyte. This halophyte, made of pickles and consumed among the population, has a high secondary metabolite content. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity of the leaves of C. maritimum.Methods: Aerial parts of C. maritimum were collected from the shores of Giresun in May 2018. The leaves of the plant were washed respectively with fresh water and then with distilled water. After they were dried at room temperature in the dark, dried aerial parts were grounded. Ethanol and methanol extracts were prepared of the C. maritimum by using soxhlet and evaporator. Then extracts were lyophilized. To determine of free radical scavenging activity, DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method was applied as spectrophotometrically. Results: The results were compared with the other standard antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene and α-tocopherol). Ethanol and methanol extracts of C. maritimum has high radical scavenging activity.Conclusion: C. maritimum leaves, which are known as sea fennel consumed as food, can also be considered as functional food due to its high radical scavenging effect.

Makale Başlığı: A General View on the Philosophy of Criminal Justice in terms of Criminalization
Özet: In this study the efficacy of criminal justice system and the basic legal values required to be protected were handled with. Especially the sanction-legal norm relation in terms of a true concept of criminal law was discussed. It was stressed on that the sanction is not an element of the concept of law, but a device that makes it effective in practice. It was paid attention to that criminal law should be understood in this context. Besides these, it was emphasized that the area of criminal acts (felonies) should be narrowed as possible and some relative light injustices should be transferred to the area of misdemeanors. It was also emphasized that the area of private law should not be narrowed in favor of public law. Accordingly, It was suggested to have a criminal law concept by emphasizing the necessity of keeping the area of private law as wide as possible especially in the face of the modern age having a large society quantitatively and the solidarity that is taking place in the form of organic solidarity on the prinsiple of volunteerism. Additionally, the importance of the basic legal values that the criminal law and the judicial system should protect rigorously was stressed on. It was also laid stress upon the necessity of a concept of criminal law which is narrow in terms of area but strong in terms of afficacy.

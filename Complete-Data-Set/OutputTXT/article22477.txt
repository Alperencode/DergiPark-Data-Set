Makale Başlığı: KYRGYZ TURKISH HANDBOOK
Özet: This book study, which took into account the one-year course order, which was planned as the first and second semesters in undergraduate education and designed as 14 weeks each, was organized in the form of 28 units (courses). This arrangement facilitated the process for both the teacher and the student who will give or take the course. Another convenience that the book offers to the learner is that each lesson is composed of a new topic, exercise, text and questions. Thus, forgetting the previous texts will not appear as a difficulty and new information will be obtained with each lesson. Grammar exercises, which are given in a simple way in the course/unit introductions, are followed by texts and dialogues. In addition, all the texts in the work have been selected considering the levels that students can reach by considering their development from the beginning stage. In addition to this, a useful part of the work is that a dictionary consisting of all the words in the dialogues, exercises and texts in the book has been added to the end of the study. It is evaluated that the book will contribute to the field with the thoughts that it will be useful for teachers, students and everyone who wants to learn Kyrgyz Turkish.

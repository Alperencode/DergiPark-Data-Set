Makale Başlığı: The correlation between self-efficacy and academic dishonesty among the students
Özet: Academic dishonesty often occurs in the academic world. Self-efficacy is one of the variables that affect academic dishonesty. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether academic dishonesty among students attending Islamic high schools is correlated with self-efficacy. The method applied in this research is correlational. The subjects of this research consist of 265 students. The research instrument applies Academic Dishonesty Scale and the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale. The data analysis technique uses the spearman rank correlation technique. According to the study's findings, there is a substantial inverse relationship between students at Islamic high schools' self-efficacy and academic dishonesty (r = -0.451; p 0.05). This study suggests that in order to decrease academic dishonesty, teachers should boost their students' self-efficacy.

Makale Başlığı: The Quest for Innovation: Methods and Mindsets
Özet: Innovation in the building industry has been lagging behind other fields, due in part to the fragmented nature of the field of construction, but also due to the lack of research methods that can effectively merge scientific and creative methods into a single approach. The paper discussed a novel method for interdisciplinary work at the intersection of computation, architectural design, engineering and material science. The approach was developed in the Material Processes and Systems Group at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University.

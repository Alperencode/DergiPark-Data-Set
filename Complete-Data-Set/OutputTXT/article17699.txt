Özet: This study investigates the effect of environmental conditions on firm performance in the Turkish logistics sector, in the context of the mediating role of strategic posture and interaction between the variables. The data set covering the Marmara region was expanded to cover all Turkey, and the hypotheses in the research model created by extending the period were retested and the study was repeated.

In this research, a survey was conducted with 475 people working in managerial positions in firms operating in the Turkish logistics sector. Empirical evidence regarding the mediating role of strategic posture was obtained from this study. As a result, it was determined how important it is for Turkish logistics companies to have a strategic posture, and it is a very important complement in terms of improving performance. In addition, the necessity for companies examined within the scope of the study to make strategic choices in line with the impact of environmental conditions was revealed.

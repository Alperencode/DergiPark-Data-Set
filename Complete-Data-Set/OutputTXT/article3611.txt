Makale Başlığı: Assessment of Cyber Attacks within the Concept of Armed Attack in the UN Charter
Özet: Cyber space became a new domain of warfare with the development of technology, proliferation of usage areas of computers and increased dependency on computer systems. Absence of an international regulation for military activities in the cyber domain does not mean these activities are beyond the scope of international law. The principles and prohibitions in the UN Charter are regarded to be in force for cyber warfare which is a comparatively new way of use of force. In order to use the right of self defence, which is an exception of the prohibition of use of force, occurrence of an armed attack is required. The weapons, which the actual armed attack comprised of, does not affect the existence of the attack. It is proven with experience that the effects resulting from the use of cyber methods as a weapon can reach the level of attacks with weapons with kinetic effects. Therefore, cyber attacks those surpass a threshold in terms of their scale and effects may constitute an armed attack which will be the basis for self defence.

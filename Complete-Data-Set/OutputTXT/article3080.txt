Makale Başlığı: The Uptake of Essential Mineral Elements by Endemic Salvia absconditiflora (Greuter & Burdet) Growing in Natural Habitats
Özet: This study was conducted to determine the uptake of essential mineral elements by endemic Salvia absconditiflora species growing in the natural habitats of Kırşehir province and its dependence on some physical and chemical properties of soil. The plant and soil samples were collected from 10 different locations. It was found that in the collected plants, K concentration was inadequate (0.344%), Fe had an excessive amount (541.853 mg kg-1), while Cu, Zn, Mn, Mg and Ca concentrations were adequate (6.154 mg kg-1, 32.610 mg kg-1, 43.395 mg kg-1, 0.507% and 3.650%). The soils had sandy clay loam texture, slight alkaline reaction (pH=7.92), an average amount of organic matter (3.06%), high amount of calcareous (35.61%) and low amount of soluble salts. It was also determined that soils had adequate K, Ca and Mg concentrations and 80% of the soil samples had inadequate level of P. Since Cu concentration was adequate in terms of microelement stock, concentrations of Zn were inadequate (0.292 mg kg-1). It was found that Salvia absconditiflora plant had the ability to grow in the soil with inadequate Zn and Mn.

Makale Başlığı: Development and Evaluation of Unplugged Algorithmic Thinking Activities Training Program for In-Service Primary School Teachers
Özet: The aim of this study is to evaluate a professional development program applied to primary school teachers for unplugged algorithmic thinking activities and to improve it based on this evaluation. In this context, data were collected for the improvement of the program by consulting the opinions of the teachers. The professional development program was implemented in 3 different groups, respectively and improved in each group. Teachers' opinions were collected for each group in line with the Kirkpatrick Level 1 assessment approach. The reactions and likes of the teachers participating in the training courses towards the training program are included. In this way, it is aimed that the data obtained will guide the development of the training program. The measurement tool consists of 6 parts and includes closed-ended questions designed for the purposes of evaluating the educators, course components, implementation, physical environment, and teaching materials. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used as an analysis method to determine whether there was a significant difference between the groups. In the study, the components in which significant differences emerged between the groups in the scores given by the participants were discovered, and the training program was improved after the first and second trainings in line with these findings.

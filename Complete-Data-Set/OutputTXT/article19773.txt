Makale Başlığı: Cancer Awareness Among Airline Pilots
Özet: A high level of cancer awareness may contribute to early diagnosis and improve cancer survival. This study is aimed to assess the level of awareness of occupational cancer among airline pilots. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study has examined pilots’ occupational cancer awareness levels for the first time. A brand-new cancer awareness survey was used to examine the awareness level of airline pilots on cancer. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was employed to analyze the survey results. The response rate was % 43.6. Data had been collected from 523 individuals, 48 of whom were female pilots. Of the participants 67.3% were long-haul pilots. Female airline pilots were much more aware of cancer in comparison to male airline pilots. Pilots flying 81-90 hours per month were much more aware of cancer in comparison to other participants. Academic articles, magazines and social media were sources of knowledge for 64.6 % of pilots whereas 39.5% of pilots were informed by e-learnings and recurrent trainings regarding the occupational cancer. According to the findings of this study, there is a need for training and media-based interventions to raise awareness and instil safe and healthy lifestyle practices at the workplace in the airline industry.

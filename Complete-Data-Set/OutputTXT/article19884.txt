Makale Başlığı: Which is the most effective biomaterial in indirect pulp capping? 4- year comparative randomized clinical trial
Özet: Purpose The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and calcium hydroxide pulp capping after complete caries removal. Materials and Methods In 73 regular patients (47 women, 26 men; age 20.65±3.02 years), having at least one deep carious lesion was recruited. Following complete caries removal, the pulp was indirectly capped with either MTA(n=51) or calcium hydroxide (n =49), randomly. Final restoration with a resin-based composite in a single session was performed. Clinical parameters including pulp vitality, sensitivity to cold or heat stimulants, percussion tests and discomfort during chewing and color were recorded after 6 months, 1 year, 2- year, 3- year and 4- year. Data were analysed statistically (p < 0.05). Results After 4- year, the survival rates were 86% (for MTA), and 82.9% (for calcium hydroxide). Totally, 8 teeth from calcium hydroxide group and 7 teeth from MTA group were endodontically treated. No significant difference was detected between the groups in terms of pulp vitality (p=0.613). Grey discoloration rate was 63% in MTA group. Conclusion Both pulp-capping materials, MTA and calcium hydroxide showed similar clinically successful performance in terms of pulp vitality in the treatment of deep dentin caries lesions after 4- year.

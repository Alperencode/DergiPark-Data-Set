Makale Başlığı: Antibiotic Resistance Profile of Escherichia coli Bacteria Isolated from Atatürk Dam Lake, Adıyaman
Özet: In this study, physicochemical parameters such as total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, temperature, and electrical conductivity (EC) and antibiotic resistance profiles of Escherichia coli isolated from surface waters of 5 different stations of the Atatürk Dam in Adıyaman were investigated. It was found that the water was of good quality in terms of total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. It shows alkaline properties in regard to pH values. In terms of temperature values, it is of fourth-class quality. Seventy E. coli strains were isolated as an indicator of fecal contamination. In isolated E. coli, antibiotic resistance was determined as 95% for erythromycin, 31.42% for ceftaroline, 30% for cefazolin, 14.28% for tertacycline, 8.50% for chloramphenicol, 4.28% for cefuroxine, and 2.85% for both safotaxime and cefepime. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) rates of 85.71% of bacteria isolated from Sitilce station and 50% of bacteria isolated from Eğri stream station were found to be greater than 0.2. MAR indexes of all bacteria isolated from Kahta, Gerger, and Samsat stations were found to be lower than or equal to 0.2. The results indicated that surface waters of Eğri stream and Sitilce regions may be discharge points of domestic and industrial wastewaters.

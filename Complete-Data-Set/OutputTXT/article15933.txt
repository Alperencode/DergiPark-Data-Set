Makale Başlığı: Determination of Some Fruit, Leaf and Stomatal Characteristics of Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) Genotypes Growing in Şanlıurfa and Diyarbakır Provinces
Özet: This research was carried out in 2021 in order to determine some fruit, leaf and stomata characteristics of hawthorn genotypes grown in the arid and semi-arid ecological conditions of the Southeastern Anatolia Region. The fruit weight of the examined hawthorn genotypes was 0.89-1.80 g, fruit length 11.48-13.62 mm, fruit width 10.92-15.68 mm, leaf area 4.02-26.01 cm2, leaf width 2.52-6.96 cm and leaf length 2.88-6.64 cm. Among the hawthorn genotypes, the highest number of stomata was found in the Diyarbakır-1 genotype with 212.91 units/ mm-2 and the lowest number of stomata was found in the Karaköprü genotype with 98.57 units/ mm-2. The mean stomatal length and width of hawthorn genotypes were determined between 34.43 (Diyarbakır-1)-40.99 µm (Karaköprü) and 27.48 (Diyarbakır-1)-32.28 µm (Halfeti), respectively. According to these results obtained; it is thought that Diyarbakır-1 genotype, which has a smaller leaf area, more stomata per unit area, smaller stomatal length and width, can withstand drought more than its leaf and stomatal characteristics, and can be used successfully in afforestation studies in arid and semi-arid ecologies.

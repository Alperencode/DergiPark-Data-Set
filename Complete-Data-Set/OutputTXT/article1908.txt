Makale Başlığı: Investigating survival/growth ratio of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) afforestation efforts and effects of BUROR terracing operations on some soil properties in the lands susceptive to soil erosion in Erzincan
Özet: In this study, taken place in Erzincan-Keklik Kayası region, following the terracing with mini-excavator called BUROR, the development stage of scots pine seedlings used in the applications of the afforestation and erosion control efforts started in 2012 until the end of 2018 vegetation period (6 years) were evaluated. In order to realize this purpose, a total of seven experimental sites with 20 m x 20 m in size (approximately 400 m2) were determined within the research area and for every vegetation period from the first planting, the heights, diameters at root collar and annual length increments were measured on randomly selected 30 seedlings for each experimental site (210 seedlings in total). Moreover, for determining the effect of the afforestation and erosion control efforts on some physical and chemical soil parameters, a total of 71 disturbed soil samples were taken (42 from the terraces around the bottom of planted seedlings, 29 from the area between terraces to represent the undisturbed natural area) and subjected for pH, organic matter (OM), electrical conductivity (EC), aggregate stability and texture analyses. The results revealed that the survival ratio of planted seedlings was about 88% whereas their average diameters at root collar was approximately 47.3 mm after the six vegetation periods. In addition, it was determined that with mean height of 130.3 cm, the seedlings on south-facing aspects were significantly taller than the ones planted on north-facing aspects with mean height of 120.9 cm. Furthermore, evaluations of the soil sample analyses revealed that building BUROR terraces with mini-excavator caused negative impacts on some soil properties and thus, it was concluded that more time is needed for these disturbed soil parameters to recover. Finally, one of the most important outcomes of this study was to obtain high correlations between the annual height increments (for 2013 to 2018 vegetation periods) and both the previous year’s total precipitation amounts (R2 = 0.77) and precipitation received during the growing-season (R2 = 0.85).

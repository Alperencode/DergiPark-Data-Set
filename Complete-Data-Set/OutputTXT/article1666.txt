Makale Başlığı: Intrahepatic branching of the portal vein in the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and American mink (Neovison vison)
Özet: The study aimed to evaluate the comparative anatomy of the liver and intrahepatic branching of the portal vein of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the American mink (Neovison vison). Due to their highly valuable fur, minks have expanded their range to many parts of Europe and become available for many biomedical studies. In this study, ten adult minks and five otters were used. The intrahepatic branching of the portal vein was studied by the combined injection and dissection technique. The macroscopic anatomy of the liver revealed that both species have six-lobed livers, although differences in shape, size and some additional fissures were documented. The portal vein, upon entering the liver, divides into the right and left branches. The branching pattern in otters had an additional branch at this level with a caudate process branch. The right branch of the portal vein ramified in the right lateral lobe and the caudate process in the mink livers, while the right branch in the otter livers only distributed functional blood to the right lateral lobe. The larger left portal branch, with its transverse and umbilical parts, ramified in the left liver portion, along with the quadrate, right medial lobe and papillary process.

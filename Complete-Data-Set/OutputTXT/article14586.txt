Makale Başlığı: A Medieval Crusader Castle: Tibnīn (Toron) 1099-1187
Özet: The Crusades were one of the most important occurrences of the Middle Ages, deeply affecting world history and leaving its mark over a period of two centuries. This politically motivated military campaign began with the call of Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont on November 27, 1095 and enabled the establishment of Latin rule in the East. As a matter of fact, the Latins, who’d established states in Edessa and Antioch first in 1098 during the First Crusade, founded a kingdom by capturing Jerusalem on July 15, 1099, after which they began invading the Palestinian territories. Toron (now Tibnīn/Tebnīn), located in Upper Galilee, was one of the areas the Crusaders captured in this process, and Crusaders built Castle Toron there. Afterward, Toron was entrusted to Humphrey I of Toron, one of the nobles in Galilee, who transformed it into a lordship of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. Toron was in a very important strategic position, and the castle built there gave the Franks many military, political, and economic advantages in the Crusader invasions and struggles against the Muslims in the region. The rulers of Tibnīn also played an important role in shaping the history of the Latin East. This study will discuss and chronologically evaluate the role of Toron and Toron Castle between 1099-1187 in the light of the information given by the sources.

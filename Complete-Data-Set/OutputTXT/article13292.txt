Makale Başlığı: Women's appearances in Refik Halid Karay's Memleket Hikâyeleri and femme fatale as an element of social criticism
Özet: Refik Halid Karay (1888-1965) narrates the reality of the homeland, which he observed in the Anatolian cities where he was exiled at a young age, in all its naturalness and in his book, Memleket Hikâyeleri, which almost competes with its reputation. Published for the first time in 1919 in the Orhaniye Printing House, these stories, in addition to the simplicity and richness of the language, go beyond the magical Anatolian reality and reveal the existing social problems with an objective approach to the homeland issues. In the 2017 edition of the Revolution Bookstore used in this study, there are 18 stories in total, including Yatık Emine, Şeftali Bahçeleri, Koca Öküz, Vehbi Efendi’nin Şüphesi, Sarı Bal, Şaka, Küs Ömer, Boz Eşek, Yatır, Komşu Namusu, Yılda Bir, Hakkı Sükût, Kuvvete Karşı, Cer Hocası, Garip Bir Hediye, Bir Taarruz, Ayşe’nin Talihi and Garaz.Karay, who dared to talk about many problems such as bribery, nepotism, corrupt and unqualified bureaucracy, intellectual-public conflict in his stories, also includes the woman shaped by the closed society structure in his stories as an element of social criticism. In Memleket Hikâyeleri, we encounter women who are defined as in addition to the image of women who are inadequate and in the background as 'female bodies' and in this context, transformed into villainous heroes. However, these women do not have a criminal and chaotic appearance that has demonic aims and desires to undermine men's economic power, social status and masculine order by seducing them with their irresistible charms except Sarı Bal. The fact that they lead a life outside the norms of society is not out of their own desire, but out of necessity. In connection with the perception of women in the cultural structure, woman is considered through her body and sexuality, in this way, the physical features of the woman are highlighted in detail. The consciously marginalized woman is transformed into a useful commodity for the reproduction of masculine power and the corrupt masculine order. This study aims to question how women, who are loaded with debilitating features with a separatist perspective, are constructed in social criticism regarding the corruption of the countryside as a center.

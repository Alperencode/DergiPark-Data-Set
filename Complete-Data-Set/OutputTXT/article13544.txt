Makale Başlığı: A Remarkable Record of Little-Known Parasitoid Wasp Helorus striolatus (Hymenoptera: Heloridae) from Türkiye with A Global Checklist of the this Family
Özet: The Heloridae (Hymenoptera: Proctorupoidea) is a family of parasitoid wasps composed of a single genus, Helorus with eighteen extant species. For Türkiye, only two species have been reported: Helorus anomalipes (from Ankara, Central Anatolia) and H. striolatus (from Bingöl, Eastern Anatolia). In this study, a new distribution record is given for H. striolatus from Kocaeli province (Marmara region), which is the second record of this relatively little-known species in this country. In addition, an updated checklist of the family Heloridae is presented.

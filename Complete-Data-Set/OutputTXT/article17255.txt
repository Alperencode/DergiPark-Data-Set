Makale Başlığı: Captive Exchanges Between Abbasid Caliphate and Byzantium as an Example of Digression in al-Mas‘ûdî's Historiography
Özet: al-Mas‘ûdî has two works that have survived in the field of akhbar. In his historiography, akhbar is the main source from which all sciences emerge. Therefore, it covers a wide field. For this reason, al-Mas‘ûdî stated that he included "subjects that are not mentioned in the title in every chapter". However, to achieve this, there is a need for a style that will make it possible to deal with the issues related to the headings. al-Mas‘ûdî met this need by including digression (istitrat), which is a narrative element in literature, in historiography. In this way, he placed the relevant subjects in the text. However, digression’s task in his style is not limited to this. Because the digressions used in the chapters in Murûj al-dhahab, can be presented as a section when it comes to al-Tanbîh wa al-ishrâf. The digression that examines the captive exchanges between the Abbasids and Byzantium is such. In this article, to follow Mas‘ûdî’s use of digression, firstly, it will be pointed out for what purposes he used the aforementioned method, based on the examples in Murûj. Subsequently, the section examining the exchange in al-Tanbîh will be evaluated in the context of the development of the method.

Makale Başlığı: Nuclear Negotiations with Iran and Turkey’s Role as an Energy Corridor Reaching Europe
Özet: Turkey’s role as an energy conduit connecting Central Asia and the Middle East with European markets has been one of the most controversial topics of the last decades. Turkey offers a unique opportunity not only to the EU which seeks to diversify its energy suppliers but also to producer countries that need access to markets. The oil and gas pipelines that were first laid out to reach the national grid have become the backbone of the Southern Corridor reaching into European markets. TANAP, which started operations at the end of 2020, and TAP which will reach out to southern Italy from the Turkish border, were the first steps to bring Azeri gas into Europe. The latest Russia-Ukraine military confrontation and compromising the status of Russia as a reliable energy supplier underlines the importance of alternative supply routes once again. A probable entry of Iran into natural gas markets after the conclusion of nuclear negotiations will increase the significance of this corridor. Iran may prefer to sell some of its production in the form of liquified gas while the rest will be delivered through pipelines to India and to the European consumers. Turkey can be a valuable energy venue to the country with the largest proven conventional natural gas reserves in the world in terms of access to the markets.

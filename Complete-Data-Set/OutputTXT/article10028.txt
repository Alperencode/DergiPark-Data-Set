Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Analysis of Intensive Care Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 with Computed Tomography and Clinical Features Despite Negative RT-PCR Test
Özet: Objective: It has been shown that Computed Tomography’s (CT) findings are more specific than the reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RTPCR), at the diagnosis of the COVID-19 disease. Our goal in this research is to study the demographics, the clinical characteristics and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 Patients who were negative for the RT-PCR but were diagnosed through the CT scan and clinical signsMaterial and Methods: From the 14th of March till the 1st of June 2020, at the tertiary intensive care unit, we had studied the demographics, clinical characteristics and mortality rates of 97 patients who were negative on the RT-PCR test, but were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive through the CT scan and theclinical sings Results: The mean age of the patients was 67±15 and 67% of the patients were males. Eighty two percent of the patients had at least one comorbidity, and the most common comorbidity was Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The most commonly seen CT signs were bilateral ground glass opacities (61%),consolidation (23%), one-sided ground glass opacities (11%). The need for the mechanical ventilator was (54%), for the vasopressors was (43%), and the mortality rate was (40%).Conclusion: Like RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients treated in ICU, patients who are RT-PCR negative and diagnosed with COVID-19 disease by CT, clinical practice are at high risk for severe disease and poor outcomes. Patients diagnosed with CT should be evaluated like RT PCR positive patients, preventivemeasures should be taken and a treatment plan should be made.

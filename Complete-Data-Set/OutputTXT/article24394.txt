Makale Başlığı: Gender is not a Prognostic Factor for Familial Mediterranean Fever
Özet: Objectives: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary auto-inflammatory disease. Our aim in the current study was to evaluate the relation between gender and clinical findings, the severity of disease and treatment compliance in FMF patients.Materials and Methods: Medical records of the 150 FMF patients were retrospectively evaluated. Disease severity scores were evaluated with the international severity score system for familial Mediterranean fever (ISSF), treatment compliance of the patients was evaluated with six-item modified Morisky scale and compared between males and females.Results: Of the 150 patients, 87 (58 %) were female and 63 (42 %) were male. Erysipelas like erythema (ELE) was more common in females (51.70% vs 30.90%, p= 0.03) and myalgia were more common in males (31.03% vs 36.50%, p=0.015). Other clinical findings were at similar frequencies.The ISSF scores of the groups were similar (2.93±2.05 vs 3.12±2.21, p= 0.716). The motivation for treatment and knowledge levels were the same in both groups (p=0.228 and p=0.112, respectively).Conclusion: Clinical findings, ISSF scores and treatment compliance of the FMF patients in both sexes are similar. The gender of the patient does not affect the clinical course of disease in FMF patients.

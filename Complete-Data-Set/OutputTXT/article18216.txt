Makale Başlığı: Resistance in Calm Down Mother and We Keep Our Victims Ready
Özet: With industrialization, the significance of the body has become remarkable because the productivity of the body is needed to be controlled. Michel Foucault, one of the well-known critiques of the 20th century, focused on power and body and emphasized the relation in his essay, entitled “The Subject and Power”. According to Foucault, power-holders shape bodies and minds through formal and informal institutions, yet his works have been highly criticized and developed by critics, including Sandra Lee Bartky, Susan Bordo, and Judith Butler. These critics have also discussed the relationship between body and power, criticized the patriarchal system that exerts power on women bodies, and claimed that women bodies are turned into desirable objects. Megan Terry’s Calm Down Mother and Karen Finley’s We Keep Our Victims Ready are examples of feminist works, in which traditional place of women on society, social pressure on women, and female embodiment are questioned. The purpose of the essay is to analyze Calm Down Mother and We Keep Our Victims Ready in terms of Sandra Lee Bartky and Susan Bordo’s feminist approach.

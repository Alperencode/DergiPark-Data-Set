Makale Başlığı: Homonymy Theory and Divine Attributes in Ibn Rushd
Özet: The relationship between philosophy and logic is handled within the concomitant-the implicant (al-lazim-al-malzum) relationship in classical philosophy, and the existence of one of them is denied unless the other one exists. Despite such a strong relationship, it is seen that the subjects, concepts and issues of the science of logic are often implicitly included in the texts of philosophers. In this study, it has been discussed how the science of logic plays a role in the discussion of attributes, which is a theological and philosophical issue. Divine attributes, as a sub-issue of the subject of tawhid, which is accepted as one of the fine matters of theology (Lataif-i kalam), have been handled and discussed by numerous thinkers in Islamic thought. Similarly, Ibn Rushd could not remain ignorant of this issue discussed by the tradition before him, and examined the subject on a new level and with a different approach. In this study, the way Ibn Rushd read the discussion of attributes has been limited only to the theory of common words. As a matter of fact, in this way, it has been shown that the relationship between logic and philosophy are two inseparable parts, and it is claimed that Ibn Rushd advocated a unique logic-based approach in the subject of attributes. Finally, the concepts of logic that Ibn Rushd used impliedly in the example of the issue of divine attributes were pointed out.

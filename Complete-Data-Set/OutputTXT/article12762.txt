Makale Başlığı: Effect of Single or Combined Dietary Supplementation of Chia Seed and Probiotic/Enzyme on Growth Performance, Ruminal and Some Blood Metabolites of Tuj Sheep
Özet: Chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seeds have antioxidant properties that can improve livestock performance and productivity. Probiotics are feed additives that may have pharmaceutical and/or metabolic effects on animal health and growth performance. Due to the differences in their mode of action, it is thought that the combined use of chia seeds, probiotics and enzyme mix will cause additional effects on performance, blood and rumen parameters in ruminant animals. For this purpose, Tuj sheep (n=20; 1.5 years old; average 40.5 kg) were divided into 1 control and 3 experimental groups, each with 5 animals. Trail rations were separately and combined with 0, 2.5% chia seeds (CT), 1g/kg probiotic enzyme mixture (P+E) and 2.5% CT + 1g/kg P+E were added. Sheep were fed for a total of 21 days, with 7 days of adaptation and 14 days of trial period. The results indicated that the effect of adding CT and/or P+E to the diets of Tuj sheep on fattening performance was found to be insignificant (P>0.05). While rumen total essential oil (tVFA) acid concentration increased in the control experimental group (P<0.05), rumen pH was not affected (P>0.05). While the concentrations of serum, non-esterified fatty acids, betahydroxybutyric acid, nitric oxide and calcium values differed from the experimental groups to which feed additives was added compared to the control group (P<0.05), it was observed that they had no effect on serum malondialdehyde, phosphorus, total protein and glucose concentrations (P>0.05).

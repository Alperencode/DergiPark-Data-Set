Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Strengths and Swelling Pressures in Freeze-Thaw Effect of Clay  Soils Improved by Guar Gum
Özet: Nowadays, the areas of use of organic and environmentally friendly materials such as biopolymers have  been increasing rapidly due to environmental concerns. The improvement of a cohesive soil using Guar  Gum (GG) was investigated in this research. For this purpose, samples were prepared by adding GG to cohesive soil in some proportions (1%, 2%, and 3%). Specimens exposed to different numbers of freeze-thaw cycles (1, 3, 5, and 10) were cured for different times. Unconfined compression strength (UCS) and  swelling pressure tests were carried out on the prepared samples. As a result, it was seen that the addition  of biopolymer to the clay soils has a positive effect on strength values and swelling pressures. In addition,  curing time and freeze-thaw conditions were thought to play an important role in soil improvement with  the use of biopolymer.

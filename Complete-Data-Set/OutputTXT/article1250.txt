Makale Başlığı: VIEWPOINTS OF SCIENCE TEACHERS ON TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE AND USE IN THE TEACHING PROCESS
Özet: The purpose of this study is to determine the viewpoints of science teachers on the variables that affected their technology acceptance and use in the teaching process based on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The participants of the research are 15 science teachers working in various schools in the Ministry of National Education in the 2021-2022 academic year. The "typical case sampling" method was used in non-probabilistic (purposive) sampling methods to determine the study group. This study was carried out based on a case study, one of the qualitative research methods. The semi-structured interview was used as the qualitative research data collection method. For the analysis of the data obtained in the study, the inductive technique was applied. The findings of the study indicated that teachers have voluntaries of using technologies in their courses. Also, it was determined that teachers have the view that using technology is necessary for teaching process. As another finding, technology is easier to the teaching process, but lack of hardware is a barrier for using technology in the teaching process. Finally, it was determined that the facilitating conditions for the teachers` technology acceptance and use are to provide enough equipment and technical support. The results obtained from the research were supported by the relevant literature, and practical suggestions were made such as the organization of in-service training activities and the establishment of technology centers within the education faculties.

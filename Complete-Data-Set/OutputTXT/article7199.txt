Makale Başlığı: Identification of Sources of Resistance to Bacterial Fruit Stain Agent Acidovorax citrulli
Özet: Bacterial fruit spot caused by Acidovorax citrulli is an extremely destructive disease that threatens the production of cucurbit plants. One of the most effective methods in the control of the disease is the use of plants resistant to pathogens. However, no cucurbit cultivars resistant to bacterial fruit spot disease have been developed so far. In this study, 10 commercial melon cultivars and 28 cucurbit genotypes were tested in both seed and seedling stages to determine the sources of resistance to A. citrulli. The study was planned according to completely randomized design (CRD) and was established as three replications with 1 plant in each pot. Among the plants tested for resistance reaction, commercial Altınbaş melon cultivar and Gönen melon genotype were found to be resistant to disease as a result of seed inoculation test, while they were determined as highly sensitive in seedling inoculation test.was determined that the Çorum 10 Dilim melon genotype was the cucurbit plant with the lowest disease severity (22.22%) in the seedling period inoculation. It was determined that the plants evaluated in the study changed their resistance reactions against the disease in different growth periods. The data obtained show that among the tested cucurbit genotypes, there are plants with the potential for disease resistance as a result of both seed and seedling inoculation.

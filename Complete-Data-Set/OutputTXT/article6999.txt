Özet: Objective: This study was conducted to determine some morphological characteristics of domestic horses in Ulupamir village of Erciş district of Van province.Materials and Methods: For this aim, various body measurements of horses were taken to obtain data on morphological characteristics. Investigation was carried out on a total of 37 horses (71%), 20 stallions and 17 mares, belonging to 32 horse breeders (72%) in Ulupamir village.Results: The least-squares means of withers height (WH), body length (BL), rump height (RH), chest depth (CD), chest width (CW), chest circumference (CC), and shinbone circumference (SC) of horses were 133.97, 136.91, 133.56, 57.16, 34.91, 151.00 and 17.24 cm, respectively. The effect of age groups on rump height and shinbone circumference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Correlation coefficients between WH and BL, RH, CW, CC, and SC were statistically found significant (P<0.05; P<0.01).Conclusion: Since it has an important place in Kirgiz culture, horse breeding carries out their breeding activities depending on the breeding experiences they have gained in the historical process in village of Ulupamir.

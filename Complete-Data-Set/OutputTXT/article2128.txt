Makale Başlığı: EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND HUMAN CAPITAL ON CO2 EMISSIONS IN SELECTED HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES: PANEL ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS
Özet: This study attempts to investigate the effects of economic growth (GDP) and Human capital (HDI) on CO2 emissions (CO2) in selected eight high income countries. These countries are Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. To do the study, an annual panel economic model was used for the period 1990-2020. The cross-sectional dependence (CD) tests and CADF and CIPS unit root tests revealed that the variables are cross-sectionally dependent and also stationary at the first differences. The Kao and Johansen Fisher Panel Cointegration Tests confirmed the cointegration among the variables. The Pooled Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) results showed an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth which implies that there exists the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the model. Furthermore, this Pooled FMOLS test results also showed that human capital improves environmental quality by reducing CO2 emissions in the long-run. The VECM Granger causality results revealed the short-run unidirectional causality from CO2 emissions to economic growth and from economic growth to human capital, and the long-run bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and economic growth. The study finished by providing recommendations for future studies based on the findings obtained from this study.

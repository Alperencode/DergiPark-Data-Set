Makale Başlığı: Examination of Music Teachers' Views on the Importance and Necessity of Accompaniment with Piano
Özet: In this study, the views of the active music teachers about the importance and necessity of accompaniment with piano in music lessons were examined. Within the scope of the study, the survey model was used and the "Opinion Questionnaire on Accompaniment with Piano" developed by Kurtuldu (2016) was applied to the music teachers. With the help of the questionnaire consisting of 32 items, the opinions of music teachers about the concept of piano and accompaniment in lessons were obtained and these opinions were compared with various variables (gender, seniority, school type, etc.) before the questionnaire. The data obtained were subjected to various statistical processes. In addition to descriptive statistical processes (frequency, average, etc.), comparative measurements (t-test, H test) were also used. When the results are examined, it is understood that music teachers agree on the idea that accompaniment with piano in lessons is a very important concept.

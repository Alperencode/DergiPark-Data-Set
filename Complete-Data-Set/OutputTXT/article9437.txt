Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Using Brass and Copper Wires on the Cutting Quality of Sleipner Cold Work Steel Cut by WEDM
Özet: Wire electric discharge machining (WEDM) is widely used in dies, punches, aerospace and automotive sectors, since materials with high hardness, and temperature resistant, which are not possible to be cut with conventional machining methods, can be cut with high precision using the WEDM method. In this study, cutting speed (mm/min), material removal rate (mm3/min), wire consume (g), machining time (sec), finish measure (mm) and surface roughness (µm) changes as a result of cutting high hardness cold work tool steel using copper and brass wire in WEDM method were investigated. In addition, worn wire and workpiece residues on the machined surfaces were detected by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray) analyzes as well as topography and composition were examined. In the case of using copper wire instead of the brass wire, wire consumption and processing time decreased by 23.30 % and 66.29 %, respectively, while MRR increased by 50 % because the copper wire electrode has higher electrical and thermal conductivity than brass wire electrode. In addition, the average dimensional deviation of the parts cut with copper wire decreased from 27 μm to 8 μm compared to the use of brass electrodes, and more precise measurements were obtained.

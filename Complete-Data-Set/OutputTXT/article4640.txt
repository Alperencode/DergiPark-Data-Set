Makale Başlığı: Historical Population Geography: The Age Structure and Aging Level of the Population in Yalvaç District of Hamid Sanjak in the First Half of the 19th Century
Özet: Even though life was not as long as it is today, phenomena such as aged, old age, and aging have always existed for all societies throughout history. Although aging is much more visible with the demographic transition in today's modern societies, it was a demographic phenomenon experienced in a different framework for pre-modern societies as well. This study tries to determine the age structure of the population from the perspective of historical population geography in the case of Yalvaç district and to take a photograph of aging at that time by using age data from archival documents of 1830/1831, the first census in the Ottoman Empire in the pre-modern period. The study also emphasizes that the data contained in the censuses of the last period of the Ottoman Empire is a unique source, especially in terms of historical population geography. The study underlines that among them, data on the age structure of the population is also an important source in carrying research on aging into the past and intends to shed light on the early period of aging before modernization. The most basic finding of the study is that although it is open to debate which threshold age value will be determined for aging under the conditions of the period, in the first half of the 19th century, old age and aging existed at varying levels according to the determined threshold value. As a result, this research sets forth that the censuses of the pre-Republican period are sources that provide data on various issues that can be handled in different aspects in terms of historical population geography and based on the age data in the 1831 census, which is one of these sources, the age structure and aging of the population was revealed in the case of Yalvaç District.

Makale Başlığı: The Problem of Citizenship in Turkish Constitutions Through the Perspective of Multiculturalism from The Ottoman Empire to The RepublicThrough the Perspective of Multiculturalism from The Ottoman Empire to The Republic
Özet: The concept of citizenship first appeared in Ancient Greece and was defined differently in each country. When we look at the Ottoman Empire, we see that the concept of citizenship was based on Ottomanism. Although some regulations were made regarding citizenship and citizenship/acceptance until the declaration of the Second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, considering that it was suitable for changing national and international conditions, the most significant change was made in 1908. It was aimed to determine the status of being a citizen/acceptance, considering the Ottoman Empire's incorporation of many different cultures. With the proclamation of the Republic, constitutional arrangements were made to create a nation-state and gather the multicultural society structure, which was inherited as the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, under a single identity. In the constitutions of 1924, 1960, and 1980, there were changes in the definition of the concept of citizenship under the conditions of the period. This study examined how the criteria of being a citizen/acceptance changed with the birth of the concept of citizenship and how multiculturalism affected the definition of citizenship in the constitutions of the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey by reviewing the relevant literature.

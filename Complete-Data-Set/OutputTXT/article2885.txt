Makale Başlığı: Ant Colony Algorithm For Household Care / Nutrition Service Direction Problem With Time Window And Fuzzy Demand
Özet: The rapidly increasing rate of elderly population in the world and in our country draws attention. Some problems arise with this aging population. These people become in need of care for many reasons such as the decrease in body resistance of aging people, slowing down of their metabolic reactions, weakening of their mobility and their ability to think and make decisions. In addition, the state of neediness is not only seen in elderly people, but also in people who are congenital or later disabled physically or mentally. Even if people are not sick, elderly or disabled, they want to receive social care services at home after health services such as surgery, treatment and examination. With these health or care services offered at home, the financial expenses of the health institutions of the governments are also reduced and these institutions or organizations get rid of the extra workload. In this study, it has been helped to increase the quality of the service delivered to the people in need by making improvements with the Ant Colony Algorithm, which is one of the meta-heuristic methods to reduce the current costs, in the nutrition or three-course meal distribution within the scope of the home care services. In this way, it is aimed to increase service efficiency by reducing the cost of vehicles providing mobile services as well as reducing the burnout of the serving team.

Makale Başlığı: A Comparative Study on Mechanic and Structural Properties of Recycled Pet (R-Pet) and Viscose Blended Yarns
Özet: Environmental pollution caused by plastic bottles is shown as one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years. Not only in the form of plastic bottles, but the microplastics formed from these bottles threaten many areas of life such as soil and ocean pollution. Converting plastic bottle wastes into textile products is one of the effective methods that not only prevents environmental pollution caused by these materials but also ensures the reuse of raw materials. In this study, the properties of blended yarns produced using viscose fibers and recycled polyethylene terephthalate fibers (r-PET) obtained from recycling plastic bottles were investigated. Within the scope of the study, blended yarns at the ratios of 33-67%, 50-50%, 67%-33% r-PET/viscose fibers, and also 100% r-PET yarns were produced. The physical, mechanical, and structural properties and also cross-sectional images of the yarns examined. The results show that the blending ratio is statistically significant on the yarn properties in general. Among the measured properties, yarns containing 33% and 50% r-PET fibers generally show similar physical, structural and mechanical properties. It is revealed that blended yarns consisting of 67% r-PET have generally better properties in comparison with other types of blended yarns. Therefore, it is possible that higher r-Pet fiber fraction in yarn can create more positive effects on yarn properties and the results are comparable with 100% r-PET yarns.

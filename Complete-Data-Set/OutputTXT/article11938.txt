Makale Başlığı: The Process of Learning the Probability with Metacognitive Inquiry: A Teaching Experiment
Özet: This study was conducted to evaluate the learning environment based on metacognitive inquiry designed for elementary school mathematics teacher candidates. A learning environment based on metacognitive inquiry was created for the teaching of the concept of probability. In this learning environment, as a result of the interviews made after each application and the observations of the researcher, arrangements were made in the learning environment. Within the scope of the regulations, an alternative model based on metacognitive inquiry emerged for pre-service mathematics teachers. In this study, which was carried out according to the qualitative research design, the teaching experiment model was used. 31 pre-service mathematics teacher candidates participated in the study. The data of the study were collected by interview form, observation form and participant diaries. The results showed that in the learning environment based on metacognitive inquiry, the clues that lead the participants to the solution were necessary in the first applications, but the participants did not need these clues in the further applications. In addition, the activities that started as small group work were transformed into individual activities in line with the feedback received from the students. It was determined that pre-service teachers made more inquiries in individual practices.

Özet: The diversity of information and communication technologies has gradually increased in the 2000s, and with these developments, it has become an indispensable part of adolescents' communication with their peers. The fact that it allows establishing interpersonal relationships and socialization, being open to multiple uses, enabling interaction, enabling discussion, and reaching different people increases the attractiveness of social media, especially for adolescents. The facilitation of internet access, the ability to access the internet at any time with tools such as smart phones, and the parallel increase in social media use make the use of internet technology and social media an important part of daily life for adolescents. Widespread and unconscious use of social media brings risks such as social media addiction, cyberbullying and loneliness. Adolescents have higher addiction rates than adults, and there is a positive relationship between adolescents' internet addiction and psychological problems such as depression and loneliness. It is stated that sharing personal information and profiles openly in social networks and interacting with these shares increase the rates of cyberbullying and victimization of adolescents and may result in loneliness.It is reported that school health nurses, together with other employees at school, have active duties and responsibilities in the planning and implementation of trainings on the use of social media, cyberbullying/victimization and loneliness of adolescents. In this article, the relationship between social media use, cyberbullying and loneliness in adolescents was discussed, and suggestions were tried to be put forward for nurses' approaches to the subject.

Makale Başlığı: The determinants of foreign direct investment for developing countries
Özet: As  product  of  globalization  and  projected  to  play  a  key  role  in  eliminating  capital  shortage  by  developing countries, Foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered tobe a form of investment in which both developed and developing  countries  compete  to  have  it.  The  advantages  of  FDI  bring  not  only  low-cost  production  but  also employment,  technology  and  management  information  to  the  host  country  and  provide  many  advantages throughout  the  country,  including  the  industry  where  the  technology  is  spreading.  Therefore,  it  is  aimed  to examine the relationship of FDI with it’s determinants in a detailed way and the effects of common parameters in the inflow and outflow of foreigndirect investments are examined together. As a result of the analyzes made by  using  panel  data  method  according  to  the  data  of  1996-2016  for  16  developing  countries,  market  size, exchange  rate,  openness,  labor  productivity,  corruption  and  political  risk  are  positively  correlated  with  FDI inflows  while  there  is  a  negative  correlation  between  interest  rate  and  FDI  inflows.  Smilarly,  the  increases  in market size, exchange rate, openness, labor productivity, corruption and political risk lead to FDI outflows from countries  while  increases  in  interest  rates  reduce  FDI  outflows.  According  to  the  findings  obtained  from  the study, for developing countries to get the share they expect from international capital, it is necessary to ensure the formation of appropriateinvestment climate by taking into consideration the political factors, especially the variables that will provide economic stability.

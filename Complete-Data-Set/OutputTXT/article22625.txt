Makale Başlığı: Introduction of the “Hadislerde Allah Tasavvuru”
Özet: In the formation of the hadith literature, the aim of collecting and classifying the hadiths, as well as the desire of the author to respond to the fiqh and theological issues of the period in which he lived, was also effective. In particular, they included these issues in their works in order to produce work-based answers to the discussion issues of the Ahl-i hadith kalam. The hadiths about the basic subjects of kalam, suchas the unity of Allah and His attributes, are included in the narration books. In order to answer the questions of the value of the hadiths in question in terms of the science of hadith, how they are understood and used, Muhammet Ali Asar's book, The Imagination of Allah in Hadiths, contains important information for theology students and hadith enthusiasts.

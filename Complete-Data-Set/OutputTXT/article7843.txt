Makale Başlığı: Preschool Teachers' Experiences and Perceptions on Children's Rights
Özet: The current research aims to uncover the experiences and perceptions of preschool teachers on children's rights. The research was conducted according to the phenomenology design and 12 volunteer preschool teachers working in public schools in Selçuklu and Meram districts of Konya province participated in. The data collected in face-to-face semi-structured interviews were evaluated with the content analysis method. Study results demonstrate that preschool teachers mostly emphasized children's rights such as care, education, life, health, play, and protection. While teachers emphasize most healthy communication with the child in the child-teacher relationship, they have different opinions about physical contact with the child. Teachers also observed that children are more aware of their right to be taken care of (nutrition and shelter), education, and play. Finally, although the teachers talked about various methods and techniques in the teaching of children's rights, they did not explain adequately how they used them. Based on these results, the author gives some suggestions.

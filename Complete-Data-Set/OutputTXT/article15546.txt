Makale Başlığı: Knowledge and Awareness of Individuals in Türkiye about Cleft Lip and Palate
Özet: Aim: Cleft lip/palate (CL/P) is one of the most common craniofacial congenital anomalies. The aim of this was to evaluate the level of knowledge and perception of individuals in a large sample group in Türkiye about CL/P.Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional 11-items questionnaire study was performed and was sent to individuals living in Turkey using Google Forms.Results: A total of 886 participants responded the questionnaire. The rate of Nasoalveolar Molding (NAM)/Feeding Plate knowledge was significantly higher in female (P<0.001). More than half of the participants who had knowledge about NAM/nutritional plate stated that they get information about CL/P from health employers (P<0.001). The results revealed that gender, age, job, knowledge of diagnosis of CL/P before birth, and sources of information about CL/P, were statistically significant independent determinants of NAM/Feeding Plate knowledge (P<0.05).Conclusions: The knowledge and awareness about CL/P is moderate among participants. Informative seminars should be organized to increase the awareness of the general population about CL/P, and reliable information should be uploaded to the Internet by the professional associations.

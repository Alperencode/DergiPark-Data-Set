Makale Başlığı: Formal and Contextual Aspects of Judith Braun’s Work and the Use of Fingerprint in Art
Özet: The hybridization of drawing and performative arts in the 1960s has significantly eliminated boundaries that mainly focused on leaving a mark on the surface. As a renowned representative of artists who used performance as an intermediary language in their drawings, Judith Braun's art is grounded on and grows out of this process. In this study, within the framework of three main titles that the artist is focusing on in her mainly fingerprint-heavy performative drawings, this study examines the formal and contextual aspects of her work while glancing at the inclinations in terms of imagery selection and formal language.  This study focuses on the use of fingerprints in contemporary art as an element adding uniqueness to work itself while supporting this emphasis through various artworks. So that; having been inspected and developed through traditional approaches and digital technologies to create a database for identification and security protocols throughout history, fingerprint analysis has also evolved into a formative language while arousing interest in the art historical process. Frequently inviting the viewer to create associations with the concept of uniqueness in art, the artistic language of Judith Braun, who has made the use of fingerprints a formative language,—which she groups under the three categories of symmetry, abstraction, and charcoal—as well as her artistic language enriched with many plastic components, have been explored through classification and purposeful sampling, referring to articles, videos, and websites. Accordingly, the choice of carbon-based media and the persistent approach of using symmetry in her compositions, and her view on abstraction have established the focus of this study.

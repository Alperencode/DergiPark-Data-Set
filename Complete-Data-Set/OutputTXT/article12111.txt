Makale Başlığı: Effect of soil biostimulant application for the growth and quality of beet seedlings
Özet: Aims: The goal of this investigation was to examine how different dosages of Viva BR® biostimulant affected the yield and quality of beet seedlings of Early Wonder Tall Top variety.Methods and Results: The experiment was carried out at intervals of 7 days, the first being at 7 days after sowing (DAS) until 28 DAS, totaling 5 applications (0 (control), 7, 14, 21 and 28 DAS) in the greenhouse of the Universidade Tuiuti do Paraná/Brazil, in a completely randomized design.Conclusions: It is concluded that the application via soil of the Viva BR® biostimulant had a positive impact on the growth of beet seedlings.Significance and Impact of the Study: In warm climates, Beta vulgaris L. (beet) of the Chenopodiaceae family predominates and its cultivated intensively in Brazil's Southeast and South regions. The seedling cultivation phase identifies the crops early establishment in the field in order to ensure stand consistency and appropriate ultimate productivity. Among the diverse techniques treated to achieve increases in this stage is the application of substances with biostimulating impacts, which result from the combination of two or more bioregulators with other compounds that might boost plant growth and development. As a result, substances having a biostimulating impact emerge as a reasonable solution for improving seedling growth. The maximum efficiency for the biometric variables at the dose of 6.2 mL L-1 while for the qualitative variables it was 5.0 mL L-1.

Makale Başlığı: Semantic Analysis of the Concept of Chastity
Özet: Chastity means being away from people who are not halal, not begging, not condescending to the property of orphans, and caring for oneself against the pressure of self-relationship. In this study, we deal with di-achronic development by making a semantic analysis of the concept of "chastity". The meanings in the information about this knowledge are incomprehensible until they are understood. Today, we see that it is far from a part of the concept of chastity and seeing it in the meaning of sexuality. However, in the Qur'an, it is also used in the sense of avoiding begging and condescend to the property of an orphan.The concept of chastity, whose semantic analysis we have made, is one of the concepts that have undergone various meaning changes, like many other concepts of the Qur'an. Due to the change of societies over time, the conversion of people from different religions, languages and cultures to Islam, and many geographical and cultural reasons, the concepts have sometimes completely moved away from their first usage areas or parti-ally changed.

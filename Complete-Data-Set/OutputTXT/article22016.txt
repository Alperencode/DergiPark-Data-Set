Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Graphite on Students in Secondary Visual Arts Course: A/r/tographic Inquiry
Özet: In this study, it is aimed to examine the effects of processing graffiti applications using a/r/tography method on students in secondary Visual Arts Course. The study group of the research was conducted on 9th and 10th grade students in an Anatolian High School located in a village of Özalp District of Van Province in the Fall and Spring semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. There were 4 boys and 6 girls in total. The application process of the research was structured by generating figurative meaning through personal history writing using the a/r/tography method and designing graffiti from the generated meaning, and this process was spread over a total of 8 weeks. According to the findings obtained from the research; students gained awareness about how they can think, question, produce meaning, and make art through writing in the Visual Arts course. In the application of graffiti, the vast majority of students used shapes and writing together. Due to the fact that graffiti is an art branch performed in an open area where everyone can see it, 9 of the students preferred to do awareness-raising work. Only 1 of the students designed a label with the letters in their name instead of conveying a message of awareness. Students saw graffiti as a means of conveying messages. The fact that the students' works will be seen by everyone has had a positive effect on their creativity and motivation and encouraged them to be original.

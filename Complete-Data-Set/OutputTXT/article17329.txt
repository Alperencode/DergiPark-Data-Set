The decree that put into effect in 1880 to solve these troubles caused the Ottomon treasury to face many problems, and the problem of agiotage turned into a major source of problems for the Ottoman financial system. Measures taken by the state against the problems due to agiotage could not be effective for a long time. Finally, 1916 The Law for the Unifacation of Coinage solved this experienced problem to a certain extent.

Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Population Characteristics of Rapa Sea Snail (Rapana venosa Valenciennes, 1846) in Çamburnu Bay (Trabzon)
Özet: In the present study, some population characteristics of Rapa Sea snail (Rapana venosa) samples collected from coastal zone of the Eastern Black Sea were investigated. For this purpose, Rapa whelk samples were collected by snorkeling from depths of ∼7-13 m in Çamburnu Bay (Trabzon) in the year 2020. Morphometric measurements such as shell size (shell length and width) and operculum size (aperture length and width) as well as total body weight were measured using a caliper with an accuracy of 0,01 cm and a digital balance with an accuracy of 0,01 g, respectively. Metal levels [zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb)] in muscle and hepatopancreas tissues of gastropods were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). It was observed that 48,76% of the sampled sea snail population was female and 51,24% was male. The mean shell length-shell width, aperture length-aperture width, and snail total body weight were determined as 35,6-27,2 mm, 26,5-11,7 mm and 14,6 g, respectively. In this study, the relation showing the relationship between the total shell length and the total body weight of the sea snail was calculated as W=0,0034*SL2,63. The least accumulation was observed at the level of lead and cadmium, when the metals in the sea snail muscle tissue were examined. On the other hand, when the metals in the hepatopancreas tissue were examined, excessive accumulation was observed at the level of zinc and copper. In addition, a positive correlation was determined between the metal accumulation in the tissues and the wet weight of the unshelled snail and the aperture length, respectively.

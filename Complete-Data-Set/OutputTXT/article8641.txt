Özet: After centuries of serious historical study, it would probably be fair to say that the vast majority of even educated people today still see the Middle Ages as a time when people were ruled by strange and fantastical conceptions. Whether the search for genuine knowledge of the Middle Ages was hampered mostly by the stupid and ignorant obscurity of the Renaissance and New Learning, or by the senseless exuberance of the Romantic movement is a matter of real doubt. The Renaissance treated medieval civilization as simply barbaric and irrational, while the Romantic movement perceived the ludicrous play of the first Gothic revival with its grotesque orders of chivalry in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as if it were the real medieval world. Of course, we will always have to give due weight to aspects of medieval life that were deemed impracticable and cannot be brought into line with the real development of modern world civilization, but I believe these are overemphasized and we tend to confuse some of the impracticable ideas of the Middle Ages with the real and governing principles behind the era.

Makale Başlığı: A CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE MAKING OF SOCIAL SCIENCES IN THE OCCIDENT  AND THE ILLUSTRATIVE CASE OF THE MIGRATION STUDIES
Özet: The Occidental mindset and trends shape the social sciences at global level. This mindset, particularly in quantitative methods, puts an extreme emphasis on the use of statistics and mathematics in social sciences which in turn bears the risk of a determinist and reductionist approach to social phenomena. Moreover, the widespread and complex use of formulas and statistics further complicate the accessibility of ordinary citizens to science and knowledge. The almost compulsory use of theory is another feature of this mindset. Although there can be benefits of theories, the use of theory shall not be inflicted as a sine qua non in the study of social phenomena. There are also Occidental social scientists who criticize the theory obsession in the Occident. Besides these, although scientific objectivity is largely claimed in the Occidental scientific milieus, there are financial considerations, methodological blinders and other potential biases which can hamper this objectivity. In this respect, a critical regard to the migration studies in the Occident provides certain examples of financial dependency, methodological blinders and other potential sources of bias which pose a threat to the scientific impartiality.

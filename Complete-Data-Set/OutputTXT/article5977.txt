Makale Başlığı: The momentum of factors in Borsa İstanbul
Özet: In this study, the validity of the momentum of the factors in Borsa Istanbul was investigated. The research covers all companies enlisted in Borsa Istanbul between the years 2008 and 2020. Within the scope of the study, Market Value, Market Value/Book Value, Price/Earnings Ratio, and Return on Assets factors were used.

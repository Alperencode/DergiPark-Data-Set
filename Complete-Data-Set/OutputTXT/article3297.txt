Özet: The primary use of the ablution unit in the mosque complexes is seen in the Masjid-ul-Nabawi, which was built in 622-623 in the form of a water well. The concept of the ablution area in the mosque, which started with this use, gained an important value in mosque complexes. Shadirvans have continued to be used in the central courtyard of the mosque for centuries due to their fuctionality and aesthetic form. The ablution areas appointed for functional use have been moved to the interiors of the mosques. In this way, the main ablution areas were moved to a more private, comfortable and ergonomic environment. The functional and ergonomic criteria of these places have been examined within the scope of this study, and a design study has been attempted, especially for the walking disabled, the elderly or those who temporarily need wheelchair use. The purpose of this is the absence of ablution units for wheelchair users in the desired standards in the mosque ablution room models that have come from the past to the present day. This article struck by this presents a proposed design of an ablution unit that can be used in mosques by for the needs of people with walking disabilities and those who for different reasons have to use a wheelchair. The proposed ablution unit was designed in dimensions compatible with wheelchairs and presented as a design proposal

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Eggs Obtained from Different Production Systems at Different storage Temperatures on Egg Quality
Özet: The purpose of this research is to determine the effect on egg quality characteristics of storage eggs produced using various egg production systems and at various storage temperatures. The egg production systems used in the study were conventional cages, enriched cages, barn systems, free-range systems (natural vegetation in the outdoor area), and free-range systems (alfalfa in the outdoor area). The study used 500 eggs from the 33-week-old ATAK-S layer genotype. Eggs from various egg production systems were randomly distributed for storage in refrigerators and at room temperature. The egg quality of ten eggs from each group was determined prior to and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days of storage. We investigated egg weight loss, egg specific gravity, eggshell strength, Haugh unit, yolk index, and albumen pH as indicators of egg quality. In this study, it was discovered that egg production systems did not have a statistically significant impact on egg weight loss, specific gravity, yolk index, or albumen pH during storage, but that storage temperature did have a statistically significant impact (P<0.05). After storage, it was discovered that the quality characteristics of eggs stored in refrigerator conditions were superior to the quality characteristics of eggs stored in room conditions (P<0.05). As a result, it may be preferable to store eggs obtained from various egg production systems in a refrigerator so that their quality characteristics can be preserved for a longer period of time.

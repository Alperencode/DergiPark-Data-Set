Makale Başlığı: Adult acetabulo- pelvic parameters in Turkish society; A descriptive radiological study
Özet: Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the prevalances of acetabular index, collodiaphyseal angle, CE angle, articulo-trochanteric distance, cross-over sign and posterior wall sign in a healthy Turkish population, in order to shed light on the production of orthopedic medical products for the Turkish population. Methods: Both hips (a total of 3960 hips) of 1980 individuals (802 females and 1178 males) from 9 different cities between ages of 18-65 years were measured and statistically analyzed in this study. Results: The right articulo-trochanteric distance of all participants was 44,71±9,67 mm , left articulo-trochanteric distance was 45,60±9,03 mm, CE angle of the right hip was 35,11±7,41˚,  CE angle of the left hip was 35,37 ±6,76 ˚, acetabular index of the right hip was 37,58±5,30 ˚, acetabular index of the left hip was 37,80±4,82 ˚, collo-diaphyseal angle of the right hip was 138,60±8,27˚, collo-diaphyseal angle of the left hip was 137,84±8,01˚, prevalence of cross over sign in the right hip was %6.46, prevalence of  cross over sign in the left hip was %6.66 , prevalence of posterior wall sign of the right hip was %4.24, prevalence of posterior wall sign in the left hip was %4.19 in the evaluation of all participants. Conclusions: This study have provided prevalence values of cross-over sign and posterior wall sign and acetabular index, collo-diaphyseal angle, CE angle, articulo-trochanteric distances of a healthy Turkish population between ages of 18-65 years.

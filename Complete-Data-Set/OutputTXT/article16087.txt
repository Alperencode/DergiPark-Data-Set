Özet: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a special type of information system in which the data source is a database of spatially distributed features to collect, store, analyze and display geographic data. GIS has gradually come to be recognized as a powerful tool for watershed management due to its ability to link physical, social and economic data. The water industry is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide and its control is only possible with the use of an information system.

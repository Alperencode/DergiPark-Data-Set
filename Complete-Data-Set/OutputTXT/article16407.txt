Makale Başlığı: THE STUDY OF CLASSICAL THEORY OF REALİSM AND NEOREALISM:ANALYSİS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE STATE
Özet: The theory of Realism is one of the most basic and most effective theories used to explain political processes and foreign policy approaches. The theory of Realism comprehensively considers the functioning of the global system and the ways of behavior of states within this system in the discipline of International Relations. Hans Morgenthau, a representative of classical Realist theory, and Kenneth Waltz, a representative of structural Realist theory, remove International Relations from being a normative theory and explain the concept of the state more fully with the concepts of ’power’, ’balance of power‘ and ’security dilemma". In this study, the important assumptions put forward by the Theory of Realism, which is one of the theoretical approaches of international relations, within the framework of the concept of the state, will be included. Although both representatives of Realist theories may seem different among themselves, in fact, they assumes that the state is more important than all other global actors. Despite the intense criticism that the theory of Realism has received from other theories, it continues to exist within the international system as a result of the methodological explanations, new deconstructions and revisions it has developed. In this research article, methodological pluralism and historical comparative research method will be used by considering inductive inferences.

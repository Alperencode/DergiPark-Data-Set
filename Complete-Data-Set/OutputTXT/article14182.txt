Makale Başlığı: Short-Time Working Practices in European Union Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Özet: During the global Covid-19 pandemic crisis, many countries, especially European countries, placed the practice of short-time work, which is a passive employment policy, at the center of labor market measures. Fundamental factors, such as application procedures and principles, eligibility requirements, duration, the amount of allowance, and social security contributions differ between countries. In addition, to minimize the negative effects of the crisis, which affected all labor markets, relaxation of regulations regarding the practice of short-time working brought international practices closer together. This study investigated the similarities and differences of the short-time working practices in European Union member countries during the pandemic crisis, evaluating current and potential reverberations in labor markets. Consequently, it is clearly inevitable and necessary to extend the regulations regarding short-time working practices, which has an important role in protecting employment during general economic crises.

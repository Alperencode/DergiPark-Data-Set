Makale Başlığı: Alien Taxa and Endangered Species in the Çanakkale Strait and Bozcaada Coasts
Özet: The entry of thermophilous alien taxa into areas where conditions for survival and dispersal are suitable has accelerated due to increased seawater temperatures and maritime trade. In this study, local and alien marine algae diversity and threatened taxa were compared in order to reveal taxon variation on the coasts of the Dardanelles and Bozcaada. Local, foreign and threatened species were collected seasonally from 8 different stations on the coasts of Çanakkale and Bozcaada at a depth of 0 - 1.5 m in an area of 150 m in length parallel to the coast. A total of 217 taxa were identified, of which 14 were foreign and 5 were endangered species. While the number of alien algae and seagrass taxa is 30, the number of endangered algae and seagrass taxa is 9 on the Turkish coast.

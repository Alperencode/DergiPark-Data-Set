Makale Başlığı: IS ABNORMAL PATELLA HEIGHT A PREDISPOSING FACTOR FOR ISOLATED MENISCAL TEARS?
Özet: Objective: The relationship between patellar height and knee pathologies has been assessed in the literature. However, the relationship with isolated meniscal tears has not been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate whether or not patellar height is a predisposing factor for isolated medial or lateral meniscal tear.Material and Methods: The consecutive 411 patients who had magnetic resonance imaging between 2018-2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients between 18 and 50 years of age with isolated medial or lateral meniscal tear were included. The patients without any meniscal tear or ligament injury formed the control group. The 160 patients included in the study were divided into three groups: 65 medial meniscus, 30 lateral meniscus, and 65 control group. Patellar height was measured with the Insall-Salvati method by two orthopedic surgeons twice, with an interval of one month.Results: All of the groups were similar in terms of age and gender (p>0,05). Patellar length (p=0.252), patellar tendon length (p=0.059), and Insall-Salvati ratios (p=0.810) of all groups did not show any significant difference. The abnormal patellar height rates were similar in the medial meniscus and control groups (12.4%-13.9%), while abnormal patella height (33.4%), especially patella baja, was observed more frequently in the lateral meniscus group. However, no statistically significant difference was found. A significant strong correlation was observed between and within the observers’ measurements (p=0.000).Conclusion: Abnormal patella height, especially patella baja, was observed more frequently in the isolated lateral meniscus group. Abnormal patellar height could be a predisposing factor for isolated lateral meniscal tear.

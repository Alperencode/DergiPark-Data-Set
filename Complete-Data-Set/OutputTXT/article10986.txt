Makale Başlığı: Fairy Tale Translation and Equivalence; Comparative Analysis of Cinderella Tale of Grimm Brothers and its Turkish Translations
Özet: When it comes into question translated children's literature, firstly the translations of literary texts such as fairy tales and stories come to mind. In this study, an equivalence analysis was carried out on the translations of the fairy tale named Cinderella, written by the Grimm Brothers, by two different translators. Before moving on to the comparative translation analysis, information about the literary genre of fairy tales, the difficulties encountered in the translation of fairy tales and the theory of equivalence in translation are emphasized in this study. The translations included in the study were analyzed comparatively in terms of Werner Koller's " denotative", "connotative", "text–normative", "pragmatic" and "formal–stylistic" equivalence approaches. In the study, it has been tried to determine whether the message conveyed by the Cinderella tale to the source language reader is also transferred to the target language reader through translations, by comparing the sentences selected from the source text and the translations of these sentences in the context of equivalence. In this analysing process, it has been discussed to what extent Werner Koller's theory of equivalence can be reflected in translations in the context of the source text and the target text, and also plausible translation suggestions are presented if it is necessary. As a result, it is sometimes caused by translators' ignorance of the target reader's language world with the concern of transferring the source text-culture to the target reader without any defects or due to the fact that they move away from the source text to make the target text more understandable or also sometimes due to translation attitudes such as word-for-word translation, adaptation, addition, subtraction equivalence inconsistencies have been observed in their translations.

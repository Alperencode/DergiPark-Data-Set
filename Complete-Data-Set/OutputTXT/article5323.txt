Makale Başlığı: An 18th-Century Scholar: Lalazari and His Hashiyah, al-Yaquta al-Hamra’, Written on Maturidi
Özet: Maturidi is one of the most important personalities raised by Turkish-Islamic geography. But it doesn’t seem possible to say that he has achieved the place he deserves in scientific studies. In recent years, studies on Maturidi is increasing. However, the hashiyahs written about Maturidi's tafsir named Ta’wilat al-Qur'an have not been brought to an independent study yet. In this article, the hashiya of Ta’wilat named al-Yaquta al-Hamra’, which was written on Ta’wilat al-Qur'an by Lalazari Mahmad Tahir, an 18th-century Ottoman scholar, has been examined. The booklet is one of the two hashiyahs written on Maturidi's Ta’wilat al-Qur'an. But it was not only used in the Turkish translation of the work but also in critical editions of the book. So, this hashiya will be examined in the article. In the article, firstly, the author was briefly introduced, and then the work was examined. Deficiencies in previous studies have been tried to be eliminated and errors have been corrected. During this examination, information was given about the manuscripts and their qualities. After that, the analysis of the work, named "exception in faith", was made and various opinions were expressed about the issue. Sufi comments were made at the end. In addition, evaluations were made within the framework of the hashiya of the author, known for his closeness to the Ibn al-Arabi school, which was kneaded with the knowledge of the sciences of Tafsir, Qalam, Tasawwuf and Logic. The edition-critiqued publication of the work has been added to the end.

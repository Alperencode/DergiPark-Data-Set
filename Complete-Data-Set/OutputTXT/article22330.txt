Makale Başlığı: The Mediterranean Diet's Role and Sustainability in Healthy Nutrition
Özet: Nutrition has a direct impact on health. The main cause of this effect is the food diversity. A good diet can help to keep diseases at bay. With its strong nutritional content and sustainability benefits, the Mediterranean diet receives more attention than other diet models. Due to climate change and population growth, the concept of sustainability has recently gained traction. One of the most important aspects of a long-term future is nutrition. In comparison to other diet models, the Mediterranean diet has a lower environmental footprint. This diet should be implemented in more populations in order to improve the environmental advantage. New studies should be used to explain the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in order to promote its global acceptance. The goal of this review is to illustrate the Mediterranean diet's importance and long-term viability in terms of healthy eating.

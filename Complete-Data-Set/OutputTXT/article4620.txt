Makale Başlığı: Times of the Day and Seasons in Ziya Osman Saba's Poetry Book of Elapsed Time
Özet: Ziya Osman Saba, one of the important names of Turkish literature, is one of the most influential figures of the six poets of the first literary group of the Republic period, Yedi Meşaleciler, who did not give up writing poetry. Saba has gained a permanent place in our literature by interpreting the poetry density he received from Ahmet Haşim in his own unique way after the Seven Torches, maintaining his individual existence in the world of literature and using Turkish language. In this article, an explanation will be made about the change of Ziya Osman Saba, who gained a reputation as a poet and also wrote short stories, from a cold face to an absolute surrender. Later, Saba, who uses many words related to time in his poems, will try to show how the times of the day and the seasons are perceived, based on his poems in the Last Time, in which he deals with the past, the present and the future as a whole by using time in a cyclical way.

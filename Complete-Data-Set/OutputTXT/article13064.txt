Makale Başlığı: EFFECT OF CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT ON TURKISH EFL LEARNERS' WILLINGNESS TO COMMUNICATE
Özet: Language classrooms provide the most suitable environment for testing speaking abilities in EFL contexts. In spite of this fact, very few studies have investigated the effect of the language classroom context on L2WTC. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between classroom environment and willingness to communicate in the Turkish EFL context. Classroom environment was dealt with in three parts which were teacher support, student cohesiveness, and task orientation. Quantitative data of the study were collected from 711 preparatory school students at Hacettepe University. The results indicated that the students highly appreciated their language classrooms and classroom environment had a strong impact on EFL learners' WTC. Pedagogical implications of the study were discussed based on the findings of the study.

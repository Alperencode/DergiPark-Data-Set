Makale Başlığı: GASIFICATION OF HIMMETOĞLU AND SEYITOMER OIL SHALES WITH PLASTIC CITY WASTES IN A BUBBLING FLUIDIZED BED REACTOR
Özet: Increasing use of plastics and accumulation of used plastics as waste after a while are the main problems of today. Thermochemical conversion processes are highly efficient for recycling waste plastics. With the gasification of waste plastics alone and with various local coals, it is possible to produce syngas containing H2, as an energy carrier, with CO and CH4 suitable for use as fuel. In this study, Himmetoğlu and Seyitömer bituminous shales and plastic waste mixture (56% polyethylene, 28% polypropylene, and 16% polystyrene) were gasified. Experimental studies were carried out in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed system made of quartz glass with an inner diameter of 4 cm and a length of 110 cm, and the air was used as a fluidizing gas and water vapor was used as a gasifier agent. The effects of temperature (750 ℃, 800 ℃, 850 ℃), water vapor flow rate (5-10-15 g / min), and plastic in the feed (40% and 70%) on the concentration of H2 and CH4 in the syngas were investigated. When the gasification results were examined, the use of steam with a flow rate of 5-10 g/min is suitable for the gasification of Himmetoğlu bituminous shale and its  mixtures. In the gasification of Seyitömer bituminous shale and mixtures, it was determined that higher flow rates of 10-15 g min should be preferred.When 40% and 70% plastic waste was mixed into Himmetoğlu and Seyitömer bituminous shales, the concentration of H2 in the syngas decreased while the concentration of CH4 increased. As a result of the study, the highest H2 concentration was obtained as 21.33% (750 ℃ - 10 g / min- 60% Himmetoğlu bituminous shale - 40% plastic waste) and the highest CH4 concentration was obtained as 74.71% (850℃- 10 g / min- 30% Himmetoğlu bituminous shale- 70% plastic waste). Suitable operating conditions can be determined by changing temperature, steam flow rate, and feed mixture ratio according to the usage area of the syngas planned to be produced.

Makale Başlığı: A NEW COURT RECORD SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE HISTORY OF AMASYA
Özet: Şeriyye Sicilleri (Court Records) has been an important source for understanding the Ottoman cities and their social structure in the term the records held. Besides those, they have also information in the many records from education, culture, and economy to governors and their subjects. Those records also have verdicts (hüküm), decrees (ferman), warrants (berat), and ordinances (buyruldu) besides the document arranged and recorded in the manuscript by the Kadı, such as sentences (ilam), muniments (hüccet), Petition (maruzatname), mürasele (correspondences), documents of marriage, divorce, inheritance, orphans and lost assets guardian, guardian appointment and dismissal, reports on the whether the Waqfs abides the codes they have or not, assignments. As the jurisdiction and authorizations of the kadi became scaled down by the time with the inheritance, waqfs, marriage, divorce, and assets, the Court Record books contents became limited too. Although there are left too many Court Records in different cities, many of them are lost. There are only two Court Records of Merzifon which covers the time span of 1883-1888 and 1887-1890. The one examined here is an 1887-1889 dated book which was not catalogued by the moment and discovered by me. The aim is to gain the book for the sake of science.

Makale Başlığı: The effect of capsaicin on TBARS and TAS in rats with hypothyroidism
Özet: In this study, capsaicin was administered to rats with experimental hypothyroidism. İt was aimed to determine the changes in plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which are indicators of oxidative stress, and total antioxidant capacity (TAS), which is one of the components of antioxidant defence mechanisms. A total of 32 healthy male Wistar Albino rats weighing 300-350 g, approximately 12 weeks old, were used as animal material in the study. Rats were divided into four equal groups control (K), Capsaicin (C), Hypothyroid (H) and capsaicin + Hypothyroid (CH). During the 30-day trial period, (10mg / kg / day) capsaicin was administered to the rats in group C by oral gavage per animal. In group H, 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) was added daily to their drinking water at 0.05% weight/volume (W/V). In the CH group, 10 mg/kg/day of capsaicin was administered by oral gavage method and 0.05% weight / volume (W / V) of PTU was added to drinking water. At the end of the application, we obtained plasma and serum samples from the subjects in the groups under general anaesthesia (thiopental anaesthesia, 40 mg/kg) and by taking sufficient amount of blood from the heart by cardiac puncture. We determined thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free T3 (fT3), total thyroxine (TT4) and free T4 (fT4) levels from serum samples, and TBARS and TAS levels from plasma samples. In conclusion, in the light of the data obtained in this study, we determined that lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress occur in hypothyroidism. However, we concluded that the application of capsaicin is partially sufficient to maintain the oxidant/antioxidant balance.

Makale Başlığı: Adoption and Children in Need of Protection A Study from the Perspective of Islamic Law and Psychology
Özet: Adoption has existed in different ways according to the cultures of societies in the historical process as a way to care for children in need of protection. The Ottomans systematized the issue of adoption for the purpose of educating children in need of protection and children converted to İslam. Adoption also existed in the pre-Islamic society of Jāhiliyya (The Age of Ignorance), and the adopted child was not considered differently than one’s biological child in matters of marriage and inheritance. However, after the advent of Islam, with the verses revealed in the Madīna period, the practice of adoption of the Jāhiliyya period was abolished. It was decided that the adopted child was not to be considered like a biological child, not to be subject to the provisions of marriage and inheritance like a biological child, and that the lineage of the adopted should be ascribed to his biological father. For this purpose, we focus in this study on determining the attitudes of Kahramanmaraş Sütçü Imam University's students towards adopted children and children in need of protection in terms of gender, type of faculty, place of residence, family religiosity and subjective religiosity through a sample group determined by a random method. In this research, we use frequency and chi-square. İn addition, to evaluate the data and find the calculated values we use the statistical package SPSS 16.0.

Makale Başlığı: An Attempt to Explain Divine Power in the Limits of Language
Özet: This study, which  centers on a holistic approach called "Qur'anic perspective", was written to examine the phenomenon of "innate science" within the acceptance of the integrity of Revelation. As far as we can see, there is extremely rich literature on the subject. In fact, we find that different worlds have been built over this concept. Almost every school does not refer to the revelatory use of the concept; In the process, it has centered on the side meanings that have been articulated to the revelations and the religious view that puts these meanings in place of truth. Although there is extremely rich literature on the form the subject has taken in the historical process, it is certain that this literature was not written in accordance with the Koranic consistency. It can even be said that the work at hand includes enough human production to shadow what the revelation says. It is obvious that those who should have a more reasonable and more principled stance on this issue cannot escape the encompassing universe of tradition. Today, as it was yesterday, it is obvious that there is a large mass of people who prefer to make people talk through revelatory cultural acceptances, ignoring the insight that the science of Kalam has given believers. This is why the voices of some circles who avoid meddling, are not heard, let alone the members of the discipline who have a say on the subject. Almost every segment has been involved in the issue one step behind the Sufi interpretation that has become the dominant view.

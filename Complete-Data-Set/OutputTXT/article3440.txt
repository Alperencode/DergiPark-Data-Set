Makale Başlığı: An International Approach to Speechwriting and Speechwriters: A Qualitative Study
Özet: Today, public speeches have a broader importance than they had before, since the transmission of a message/event has sped up significantly due to internet-based communication tools. When the role of speeches for individuals, organizations, societies, and countries is considered, designing a speech becomes more crucial. In addition, speeches feature in building the character of a company, a political party, or a person. In this context, while the number of speechwriters has increased noticeably, the profession in the communication realm is still highly invisible and, as a result, academic research on the subject is limited both in Turkey and beyond. This study aims to draw attention to speechwriting based on ancient rhetoric and to expose a broad international perspective on it. To reveal differences in implementation and perception and to find common ground in speechwriting, structured, in-depth interviews with twenty prominent speechwriters serving in the public and private sectors in ten different countries were conducted. According to the analysis, the international perspectives can be categorized regarding the length of a speech (15-20 minutes), the steps of speechwriting (research, imagination, mind mapping, determining the main message and side elements, writing the first draft, revising the text based on feedback), audience analysis, the structure of sentences (short and active sentences blended with long ones), and speechwriters’ characteristics (language skills, modesty, patience, etc.).

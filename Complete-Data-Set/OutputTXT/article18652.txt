Makale Başlığı: Energy Analysis in a Solar House with Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) System
Özet: Increased energy demand and fossil fuel usage of the world has led to the search for new and clean energy production methods. Renewable energy sources are developing and emerging options for energy production methods. Sun is the most accessible and stable renewable energy source. There are several methods to produce energy from the sun. The building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system is a well-known method for generating electricity by using solar cells to transform the energy from the sun into electricity. BIPVs are a new technique to reduce energy consumption from fossil fuels. Passive solar houses mean that the energy demand of the living space is met with the usage of solar energy for the heating and cooling demand of the living space. In this study, an existing house, located in Istanbul, is modeled and covered with photovoltaics with the help of a computer program and the amount of energy produced with the aid of these photovoltaics is presented. The analysis demonstrates that the yearly average amount of daily electricity production is varied between 1.05 kWh as the minimum value and 19.7 kWh as the maximum value for all facades. The yearly average amount of monthly electricity production is varied between 31.8 kWh as the minimum value and 599 kWh as the maximum value for all facades.

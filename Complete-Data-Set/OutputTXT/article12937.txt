Makale Başlığı: From Lifelong Education to Lifelong Learning: Faure and Delors Reports
Özet: The aim of this research is to examine the transformation of lifelong learning discourse by considering the Faure and Delors Reports prepared by UNESCO, which represent two different trends in adult education periodically, in the socio-political context in which they emerged. In this context, the socio-political backgrounds, formation processes, and contents of the periods in which the said reports were created were analyzed in-depth, and the effects of the reports on lifelong learning and the main criticisms of these reports were examined. These reports, which reflect the transformation of the concept from lifelong education to lifelong learning, are among the important studies that are considered as turning points in the field. This research is a descriptive study designed in the general survey model, which is one of the survey models. The reports in question are of importance beyond an ordinary report analysis due to the historical characteristics of the periods in which they emerged. For this reason, the synthesis of historical research and document analysis methods, as well as the scanning model, was used in the research. As a result of the research, it has been determined that the humanist and democratic content of the concept of lifelong education, which existed in the 1970s, gained an instrumental dimension in the 1990s to train the workforce needed by global capital. In this context, it is seen that the discourse of lifelong education, which is a public right, has evolved into the discourse of lifelong learning, which is shaped according to the demands of the market.

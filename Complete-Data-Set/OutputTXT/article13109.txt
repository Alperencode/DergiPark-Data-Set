Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Different Carbon Ratio and Temperature Effects on Impact Toughness Properties of Nickel Added Powder Metallurgy Steels
Özet: In this study, impact toughness properties were investigated by adding nickel element to Powder Metallurgy (PM) steels with different carbon ratios. For this purpose, 0.4% - 0.8 - 1.2% by weight natural graphite, 2% nickel and 0.5% zinc stearate as lubricant were added to the pure iron powder, respectively. Impact test samples were produced by shaping the prepared powder mixtures at room temperature and 700 MPa pressing pressure in a single-acting mold. Then, it was sintered at 1200 ºC in a vacuum atmosphere of 5x10-2 Pa for 20 minutes. After the sintering process, impact toughness values were determined by applying the impact test to powder metal steels at different temperatures. Depending on the chemical composition of the alloy, SEM microstructure and fracture surface analyzes were performed and the relationships between macrohardness values and impact toughness were investigated. It has been determined that nickel-rich ferritic solid solution forms in the microstructure of nickel-added PM steels and suppresses the precipitation of pearlite. All samples had very low impact toughness at -20 °C, while the impact test values at +40 °C decreased with increasing carbon content.

Makale Başlığı: A Review on Musibet-i Fahreddin, the First Tragedy of Azerbaijan Theater
Özet: The birth of modern theater in Azerbaijan, as in Turkey has improved under the influence of European lifestyle. This effect was first observed in Tiflis and then in XIX. Towards the end of the century, parallel to the development of the petroleum industry, it manifests itself in Baku. Mirza Fetali Ahundzade, the first theater writer of the Turkish world, makes a big breakthrough in the Azerbaijani theater with his theatrical writings. Najaf Bey Vezirov, the second great figure in the Azerbaijani theater after Ahundzade, also played a very important role in the progress of the Azerbaijani theater with new issues. In addition to Azerbaijan's first single-screened plays, Azerbaijan's first tragedy, "Musibet-i Fahreddin" was written in 1896. The subject of "Musibet-i Fahreddin" is seen as a bloodbath between two rich families, but the writer puts forward the explanation of the sciences and reveals its consequences in his life. Vezirov wishes to get married by getting rid of the problems of old law. This situation is explained through Fahreddin. In our work, we will try to evaluate Musibet-i Fahreddin's play, which is of great importance in the Azerbaijani theater, in the context of the civil affairs and people who deal with it

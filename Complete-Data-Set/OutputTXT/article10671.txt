Makale Başlığı: Determination of Weeds Flora in Apple Orchards of Iğdır Province and Approaches of Farmers to Solve the Problems
Özet: This study was conducted to determine the weed species, their frequency, and density of weeds in the apple orchards of Iğdır province, as well as the approaches of the farmers in the region to solve the weed problems and their control methods. Surveys were conducted in 50 apple orchards in 2020. Besides, a questionnaire survey was conducted with 100 farmers engaged in apple growing. A total of 53 weed species belonging to 15 families, including 1 parasite, 2 narrow-leaved, and 12 broad-leaved weeds were identified. The highest number of weeds among these identified families were Asteraceae (12 species), Poaceae (12 species), and Brassicaceae (9 species), respectively. The weeds with the highest frequency were Bromus tectorum (84%), Echinochloa crus-galli (84%), and Trifolium pratense (82%). The weeds with the highest density were determined as T. pratense (76.44 plant/m2), Seteria viridis (74.62 plant/m2), and Alopecurus myosuroides (70.96 plant/m2). In the current study, 96% of the farmers stated that the weeds were very dense in the apple orchards and the weed species with the highest density were A. myosuroides (80%), Poa trivialis (74%), and Hordeum murinum (73%). They stated that none of the farmers engaged in apple cultivation in Iğdır province used chemicals for controlling weeds. In addition, when the opinions of the farmers were taken, they stated that they mow the weeds in the apple orchards and use them to feed their livestock. As a result, it is seen that the farmers do not manage weeds in the apple orchards of Iğdır province and the density of weeds in the apple orchards is very high.

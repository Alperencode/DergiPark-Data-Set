Makale Başlığı: Executive Functions and Activity Participation of Children with Special Needs in the COVID-19 Pandemic Process
Özet: Purpose: The study was conducted to determine the participation of children with special needs in leisure time activities and the relationship between executive functions and activities during the pandemic process. Material and Methods: "Canadian Occupational Performance Measurement (COPM)" was used to measure children's participation in leisure activities and the "Childhood Executive Function Inventory Parent/Teacher Form (CHEXI)" to determine their level of executive functions. CHEXI consists of working memory and inhibitory control subheadings. Results: A total of 37 children, 20 girls and 17 boys, aged 2-20 years, with a mean age of 13.1±4.5 years, were included in the study. The mean working memory score was 46.18±7.06, and the inhibitory control score was 35.51±10.18. It was determined that there was a relationship between executive functions and activity types in children participating in activities (p<0.05). There were significant correlations between inhibition and team sports (r=-0.360, p=0,029) and running (r=-0.334, p=0.043) in participation in physical activities. A significant correlation was found between working memory and music/painting/handicrafts (r=-0.400, p=0.014) in participation in skilled activities. Conclusion: Since the study results have shown that the executive functions of children participating in activities are positively affected during the pandemic, it is thought that activity-oriented programs will contribute significantly to the support of executive functions in the management of this process.

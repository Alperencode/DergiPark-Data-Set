Makale Başlığı: AN EVALUATION OF BIOPHILIC DESIGN CRITERIAS IN PLACES
Özet: Today, living spaces with higher floors and smaller field of use are the interior places where people’s time is mostly spent. With the new understanding of normal life, this situation has become a necessity rather than a choice, and beneficial contact with nature has inevitably been prevented. Biophilic design is not only a functional and visual discipline, but also a design approach that provides mental well-being. From this point of view the importance of biophilic design was emphasized based on its effects on human life and body, importance of bringing places that are limited by the standards of nature together with nature for human and society, and necessity of applying biophilic design criteria in the environment and interior spaces which the building is in was highlighted.

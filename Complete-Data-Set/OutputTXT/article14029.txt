Makale Başlığı: Removal of Methylene Blue Using A Cheap Adsorbent: Optimization, ANOVA analysis
Özet: In this study, methylene blue adsorption was investigated using clay found locally in the Kars region. The temperature, dye concentration, and amount of adsorbent that can affect the adsorption were optimized by the Taguchi method. L9 orthogonal experimental design matrix was used in the design. Here, temperature (20-25-30°C), the concentration of dye (80-120-160 mg/L), and the amount of adsorbent (0.04-0.08-0.12 g) were selected as parameters affecting adsorption. In the study, 98.6% of methylene blue was removed. The optimum conditions for the removal of methylene blue are the temperature of 20°C of the temperature, 80 mg/L of the concentration, and 0.12 g of the amount of adsorbent. From the ANOVA analysis performed to observe the effect of the parameters, it was seen that the amount of adsorbent was the most effective parameter, then the concentration was effective and the temperature was ineffective. The same study was also optimized on the amount of methylene blue adsorbed per unit adsorbent. The optimum levels of temperature, concentration, and amount of adsorbent were determined as 20°C, 160 mg/L, and 0.04g, respectively. According to ANOVA analysis, it was observed that the concentration and amount of adsorbent had approximately the same effect, while the temperature was ineffective on adsorption. In the experiments carried out under optimum conditions, the value of qt=87.33 mg/g was reached.

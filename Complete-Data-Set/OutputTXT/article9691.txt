Makale Başlığı: Optimization and characterization of acid catalyzed castor biodiesel and its blends
Özet: In terms of energy security, biodiesel has become an alternative, safe, and biodegradable fuel. Here, to produce biodiesel from castor oil, a transesterification process was carried out using an acid-catalyzed catalyst. Three blends (B10, B20 and B30) were prepared by using different proportions of castor biodiesel and petro-diesel. Biodiesel optimum yield of 80% was obtained from 5 mL of castor oil with the influence of different parameters such as 1.75 mL of methanol and 0.08 mL of conc. H2SO4, at 65 ℃, for 3 hours with 600 revolutions per minute stirring speed for 5 mL of castor oil. Physiochemical properties of all samples such as moisture contents, iodine value, free fatty acid value, saponification value, ester value, acid value, peroxide value, viscosity (at 40 ℃), specific gravity, refractive index, density, boiling point, average molecular weight, and higher heating value were determined. Castor biodiesel characterization was resulted as 0.112 (percentage), 86 mg KOH/g, 1.0878 mg KOH/g, 0.439 mg KOH/g, 84.9122 mg KOH/g, 86.32 gI2/100 g, 20.66 Meq/100 g, 0.8850 g, 17.21 cSt, 1.4667 nD, 0.8910 g, 290 ℃, 1982.05 g, and 44.479 MJ/Kg min, respectively. The functional groups were investigated by using FTIR. In the present study, it was demonstrated that biodiesel can be produced using a method of acid-catalyzed transesterification by using castor oil.

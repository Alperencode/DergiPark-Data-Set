Makale Başlığı: Effects of Coconut Oil on Weight Loss and Blood Lipids
Özet: Coconut oil is an edible oil derived from a tree called Cocos nucifera, which has been used in tropical countries for thousands of years. Pure coconut oil is obtained from the fresh, mature kernel of the coconut by mechanical or natural means, with or without the use of heat without chemical refining. Coconut oil is mainly composed of medium chain fatty acids (MCTs) consisting of 6-12 carbon atoms. It has been reported that the effects of coconut oil on weight loss are due to increased thermogenesis and satiety response. The potential beneficial effects of virgin coconut oil on blood lipids and LDL oxidation are thought to be due to the bioactive polyphenol components it contains. This review provides an updated view of the effects of coconut oil, which has come to the fore with its health benefits in recent years, on weight loss and blood lipids.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of The on Turkish Foreign Policy “Memorial of Agreement On The Limitation of Marine Jurisdictions in the Mediterranean” Signed Between Turkey And Libya
Özet: With the hydrocarbon gas found in the early 2000s, the Eastern Mediterranean has become a more important region for both the region and global states. In order to extract and operate energy reserves, some states in the region have signed agreements specifying maritime jurisdiction areas. However, due to the fact that the EasternMediterranean is an area with high energy reserves, when the maritime jurisdiction areas determined by the states overlapped, it caused problems between the states.In particular, the maritime jurisdiction areas of Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration, which are against international law and which are not fair, have actually turned into a policy of imprisoning Turkey in its own territorial waters. In this context, this study evaluates the debates between Turkey and the Greek Cypriot administration-Greece on the maritime jurisdiction areas in the Eastern Mediterranean with the discovery of hydrocarbon energy sources, and reveals the attitudes of other states in the Eastern Mediterranean. The effect of the agreement, which determines the maritime jurisdiction areas between Turkey and Libya, on Turkish Foreign Policy is explained.

In this direction, the aim of this study is to examine the mediating role of risk bias in the relationship between the overconfidence bias of individual investors trading in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) on their investment performance. The survey method was chosen as the data collection tool and the obtained data were analyzed with the Linear Regression model. As a result of the study, positive significant relationships were found between the overconfidence bias on the investment performance, the overconfidence bias on the risk bias and the risk bias on the investment performance.

According to this result, it can be said that the study will contribute to the awareness of individual investors about behavioral biases and thus to make better investment decisions.

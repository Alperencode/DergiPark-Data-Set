Makale Başlığı: The Qualitative Look at Performance Management from The Perspective of Entrepreneurs
Özet: It is known that the negative situation that arises as a result of the mismanagement of the concept of 'performance' with managerial behaviors creates a change on the productivity of the employees. In this study, it is aimed to determine the "performance" approaches of entrepreneurs, to make sense of their performance evaluation systems, to describe how and under what conditions the system they implement affects the motivation of the employee. Focus group interviews were conducted with 15 entrepreneurs in Gaziantep and the data obtained were analyzed by coding and categorizing with the MAXQDA 2020 qualitative data analysis program. The performance criteria of the entrepreneurs participating in the study are that the employee loves his job and does it well, being innovative and teamwork. Entrepreneurs provide training, conduct motivational interviews, warn their employees and in some cases fire them in order to prevent poor performance. In addition, entrepreneurs praise employees as reward and motivation, use bonus system, and give additional salary to employees. While making the remuneration, the performance of the employee at work, the experience of the employee and the quality of the work done are taken into consideration. While determining the nature of the job, the labor intensity, technology, and continuity of the job are evaluated. The study provides detailed information, directly and indirectly, about the perceptions of entrepreneurs, who are professional leaders, towards determining the performance of their employees; and makes suggestions to entrepreneurs, managers, researchers and politicians.

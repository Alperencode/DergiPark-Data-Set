Makale Başlığı: A CORPUS-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE MOTHERHOOD AND FATHERHOOD METAPHORS IN TURKISH
Özet: Metaphor is a well-studied area in linguistics and outside the linguistic scope. It has been widely examined as a reflection of our understanding of the outside world specifically after Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Kövecses (2002). In Turkish literature, it has either been studied on literary texts or on the intuitive productions of native speakers. In order to understand the conceptualization of motherhood and fatherhood in Turkish, the purpose of this study is to seek answers for the following questions. The first one is about what the salient metaphors about motherhood and fatherhood in Turkish are and the second is about what the similar and different aspects of these two metaphors in terms of their source domains are. For these purposes in mind, TUD v3.0 was used as the source of natural language data in Turkish and WebCorpLive as the complementary real-time linguistic data. The concordance lines about the two concepts were gathered in a database, unrelated uses were deleted, and metaphoric uses were revealed examining the co-occurrences. The overall results were interpreted comparing the findings for each concept. Based on the original Turkish metaphors of motherhood and fatherhood show that there are similarities as well as differences in the conceptualizations of Turkish native speakers. It is observed that metaphors specific to motherhood seem to refer to a dynamic process whereas metaphors of fatherhood have a more static and punctual implication.

Makale Başlığı: MESNA HAS ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL ON INTESTINE, LIVER, KIDNEY AND LUNG INJURY INDUCED BY INTESTINAL ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION
Özet: An ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury of small intestine is a serious and common condition that is a result of the blockage of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) due to some significant clinical problems. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Mesna on systemic injury induced by IR in small intestine and liver, kidney and lung of rats. Thirty-two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups as control, ischemia, IR (Sham) and IR+Mesna. Ischemia period was executed by clamping SMA for 2 h and after when reperfusion was permitted by removing the clamp from SMA for 2 h. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities were measured spectrophotometrically in the tissues.  Microscopic examination was performed with Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining for light microscopy and double staining (Uranyl acetate and Reynolds’lead citrate) for electron microscopy. Oxidative damage was determined in ischemia (p < 0.05) and IR groups (p < 0.05) by Chiu score in small intestine and also antioxidant enzyme activities in all groups. Significant recovery in SOD, GPx and CAT activities in IR+Mesna group was determined but the effect of oxidative damage was not reduced significantly histopatologically. Mesna treatment caused recovery in SOD, GPx and CAT activities but not achieved an improvement in the histopathologic findings in level of light microscopy in IR damages but contains the signs of improving at electron microscopy level in Mesna dose and application time of IR.

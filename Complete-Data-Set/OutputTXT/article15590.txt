Makale Başlığı: Vehicle Detection from Aerial Images with Object and Motion Detection
Özet: Moving vehicle detection is one of important issues in surveillance and traffic monitoring applications for aerial images. In this study, a vehicle detection method is proposed by combining motion and object detection. A method based on background modeling and subtraction is applied for motion detection, while Faster-RCNN architecture is used for object detection.  Motion detection result is enhanced with the proposed superpixel based refinement method. Experimental study shows that performance of motion detection increases about 8\% for $F_1$ metric with the proposed post processing method. Object detection, motion detection and superpixel segmentation methods interact with each other in parallel processes with the proposed software architecture, which significantly increases the working speed of the method. In last step of the proposed method, each vehicle is tracked with the kalman filter. The performance of proposed method is evaluated on the VIVID dataset. The performance evaluation shows that proposed method increases $F_1$ and recall values significantly compared to the motion and object detection methods alone. It also outperforms SCBU and MCD methods which are widely used for performance comparison in motion detection studies in the literature

Makale Başlığı: The theoretical roots of gifted and talented youth education programs: The CTY case example
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine past literature from a reductionist approach of findings derived from academically gifted and talented youth research, and to examine the factors explaining the roots of such abilities. Also explored are common human development theories of social information processing perspective, social cognitive, attachment and behavioral genetics. This analysis explores these theories and how they can be combined to allow for the best understanding of gifted ability. Detailed here is also the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth program as a model to show a current example of how theory is being applied to practice in a gifted youth setting. The writing concludes by discussing how research of combined theories on gifted abilities can further inform practice and understanding of gifted children’s abilities. Further, research suggestions are provided for meeting the gaps in literature on the roots of gifted youth abilities.

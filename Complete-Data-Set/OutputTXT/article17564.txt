Makale Başlığı: CLAIM NOTICES UNDER THE FIDIC CONTRACTS: A COMPARISON OF THE CIVIL LAW AND COMMON LAW PERSPECTIVES
Özet: The FIDIC family of contract templates is leading in the construction industry at this point in time. An essential provision in those templates regards the claim procedure for additional time or money, the first step of which is notification of claims in a timely and duly manner. Non-compliance with notice requirements will otherwise deprive contracting parties of their right to additional time or money. Surprisingly, sources in legal literature regarding such an essential provision are still few and far between when it comes to civil law countries. As such, our main aim in this article is to fill this gap as much as possible. The first chapter will scrape the surface of the FIDIC standard contracts. Then, we will delve into the notice requirements, considering that disputes in the construction sector are circling around failure to comply with the notice requirements. Finally, we will determine the legal arguments available to prevent the strict application of the notice requirements. While doing this analysis, we will draw on the judgments from the civil law and common law systems.

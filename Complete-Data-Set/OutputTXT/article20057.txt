Makale Başlığı: Cahiliye Döneminin Meşhur Üç Medîh Şairi En-Nâbiğa, Zuheyr ve El-‘Aşâ
Özet: An-Nâbighâ, Zuhayr and Al-‘Aşâ are accepted among the leading poets in the Jahiliyyah Period. These poets are three well-known poets who have made a great contribution to the development and progress of the genre of eulogy-themed poetry in the period of Jahiliyyah. They have influenced the poets interested in the poetry of the Classical Arabic Literature and even the ones writing poems on the neo-classical movement having occurred at the beginning of the Arabic Literature. Three of the poets earned income by versifying poems based on eulogy-themed poems, and they prepared the ground for the eulogy being praised by other poets and becoming widespread. They have chosen the ones living and having the authority of the government in the Jahiliyyah Period as the praised. Among these three poets, only el-‘Aşâ despite being nonmuslim he has versified eulogy for the prophet Muhammed (pbuh) because of being one of the poets having seen both the Jahiliyyah and Islamic Periods. The common features of the three poets’ eulogies are that their styles are extremely simple and fluent.

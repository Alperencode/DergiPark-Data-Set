Makale Başlığı: Artificial Intelligence, Critical and Clinical: Society, Diagnosis and Treatment from the Perspective of Neuroscience Research
Özet: This article examines the new social perspective that the digital health transformation issue, which is emerging in the context of artificial intelligence research and applications, is produced through this current interaction of human societies and intelligent machines. By examining this problematic, it is aimed to understand what the current formation of diagnosis and treatment processes means in terms of social change. In order to analyze the main problematic, the subject has been approached in terms of neuroscience research as a theoretical framework. The theoretical framework in question is a perspective that uses the structure of organic neural networks in neuroscience research to develop artificial neural networks in artificial intelligence studies and has social references on connections and interactions. This point of view also constitutes the intellectual basis of the article, which is defined as the interconnected whole of life. A methodical operation has been developed by associating the critical and clinical concepts to clarify this intellectual basis, with the remodeling of the diagnosis and treatment processes that took place in the research aim. Understanding the transformation in health with its new scientific and social conditions is important in order to analyze the digitalized society in terms of medicine. It has been determined that this transformation, which takes place in an interconnectivity-based sociality, is a combination that offers clues of a new sociality in which human and technology come together in terms of digitalization in the field of health.

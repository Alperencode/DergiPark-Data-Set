Makale Başlığı: Effect of Computerized Tomography Simulation Education on Student Education: A Distance Education Example
Özet: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the simulation program that can simulate the CT device and work online on the knowledge and skills of the students and the attitudes of the students related to this education. The questionnaires prepared by the researchers were applied before and after simulation training to vocational school students who were studying in the first year of the Medical Imaging Techniques (MIT) program and who accepted to participate in the study. The obtained data were evaluated by appropriate statistical methods. It was determined that 55.4% of the students had good technology use skills, and 94.6% of them not received any training on CT before. While there was a 42.9% level of knowledge about the procedures to be performed after the patient information was entered before the training, this rate increased to 67.9% after the training. A statistically significant difference was found between before and after the training (p<0.001). Simulation education is of great importance in terms of radiation safety and radiation health of students. The results of our study showed that students will have more knowledge about CT device before starting their professional internship. After the simulation, there was an increase in the knowledge of the participants about the CT protocol implementation steps. In the simulation program, the protocols to be used in pediatric and adult patients and the dose parameters given can be tried in more detail and the optimum values and protocols can be determined.

Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Attitude towards Uncertainty and Perceived Contamination Cognition on Mental Status of Nurses during the Covid-19 Pandemic
Özet: In epidemics, nurses often work on the front line. Therefore, there is a need for studies on the factors affecting the mental states of nurses. This study was conducted to examine the effect of nurses' attitudes towards uncertainty and perceived contamination cognition on mental state during the coronavirus disease pandemic. The study was completed with 328 nurses who filled the data collection forms. Data were tested Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and Spearman correlation tests.  In the relational questions were used with simple and multiple linear regression analysis. The average age of the nurses participating in the study was 31.81 ± 7.69, and 84.1% of them were women. All of the participants worked actively during the coronavirus disease pandemic process and 75.0% of them provided care to patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease. Moreover, 68.6% of the participants defined the coronavirus disease pandemic process as frightening/worrying. It was determined that the nurses had high levels of depression, anxiety and stress. While the average score of intolerance of uncertainty was 41.83 ± 8.40, their contamination cognition was 80.34 ± 1.59. A positive relationship was found between intolerance of uncertainty and contamination cognition, depression, anxiety, and stress in nurses. A positive relationship was also determined between contamination cognitions and depression, anxiety, and stress.

Makale Başlığı: The Role Of Trt World In Turkey’s Public Diplomacy
Özet: Nowadays, countries resort to soft power tools for public diplomacy, as well as military, political and economic power elements to achieve their foreign policy goals. In public diplomacy, there is a goal to reverse the bad impression that has been formed about the country and establish good relations. The media is one of the most important elements of this relationship process. In terms of its ability to reach interested people quickly, easily and effectively, the media is used as an important tool in public diplomacy. In addition, with the dec of the Internet, new media has been included among the media types. The concept of new media is understood as the media that conducts work for public diplomacy, in contrast to the classical understanding of the media. In this study, TRT World, which started broadcasting in 2015 and has the distinction of being the first channel to offer programs to world countries in English, is examined in the context of the role of TRT World in Turkey's public diplomacy. In this context, the “organization, mission and vision, revenues, organizational chart, personnel employment, audience, location, news policies, TV programs, website and social media accounts” of TRT World were examined in the study. As a result, it was concluded that TRT World is one of the elements of Turkey's public diplomacy policies that offers programs in English to the world and is a supporting tool in Turkey's international publications.

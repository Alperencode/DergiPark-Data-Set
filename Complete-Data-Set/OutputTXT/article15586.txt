Makale Başlığı: Existence Results for Hybrid Stochastic Differential Equations Involving  $\psi$-Hilfer Fractional Derivative
Özet: In this paper, we discuss the existence of solutions for hybrid stochastic differential equations (HSDEs) with the $\psi$-Hilfer fractional derivative. The main tool used in our study is associated with the technique of fixed point theorems due to Dhage.

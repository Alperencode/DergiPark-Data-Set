Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Apple (Malus Pumila) Additive on Alfalfa Silage Quality
Özet: In this research, the quality parameters of alfalfa silage made by adding 5% and 10% apples to fresh alfalfa were evaluated. For this purpose, laboratory silos were prepared by adding two different levels of Altınçekirdek apples to the alfalfa dry matter was increased with the addition of 5% wheat straw. The control group and experimental groups were formed from 10 replications. The silages prepared in one liter jars were opened after 60 days. Physical and chemical analyzes were made on silage samples. All silages were scored as "Medium quality" in terms of odor, appearance and color. It was determined that the effect of adding apple to alfalfa silage on dry matter (DM), crude ash (CA), crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content was not statistically significant compared to the control group. It was detected that the pH values of the silages were between 5.46 - 5.72, but there was no significant difference between the groups. It was determined that lactic acid (LA) level increased significantly with 10% apple addition, and acetic acid (AA) and propionic acid (PA) levels decreased significantly in silages (p<0.05). It was observed that there was no significant difference in butyric acid level between groups. Ammonia-bound nitrogen (NH33N-TN) ratios in total nitrogen of silages containing 10% apple were found to be significantly higher than the control group silages (p<0.05). As a result, it has been concluded that 10% apples added to alfalfa silage improved the silage quality, but in future studies, better results can be obtained with the addition of apple in alfalfa silages with higher dry matter levels.

Makale Başlığı: Sugar in Türkiye: A Short Discussion of Production, Consumption, Trade and Policies
Özet: This paper shortly discusses Türkiye’s sugar markets from four different perspectives, namely policy, production, consumption, and trade. According to the main findings of the paper, Türkiye has supported sugar markets mostly via sugar factories. However, the role of state decreases in the markets, especially with the privatization policies of sugar factories. Sugar lands significantly decreased with the production quota scheme. The same decrease is also valid for the price of sugar beets. However, the sugar prices that are significantly important for consumption are almost the same for the last four decades. The raw sugar consumption decreases after the 2000s with possibly the change of consumption habits. Türkiye is a net exporter in the trade of sugar and sugary products. It is expected that the importance of evaluating the sugar markets would keep its place in the following future.

Makale Başlığı: Turkish Agricultural Statistics: An Integrated Database Proposal
Özet: The first parts of the study, consist of  a review of the state, structure and providers of agricultural statistics in Turkey, followed by quality evaluation by  a group of academic users using 6 quality indicators and 8 sub-groups of agricultural statistics. In the folllowing sections, proposal for an integrated database system named TAR-İST is introduced. This system consists of a source database with detailed statistics such as production, inputs, prices, foreign trade which are semi-integrated within but not integrated between and a core database which is integrated via integrating structures such as commodity balances, value added, input accounts, input-output tables, value chains.  In the final sections, proposals are introduced regarding TAR-İST user interfaces and management. While, it is natural for TAR-İST to be developed and disseminated by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry which is in charge of the sector, in collaboration with TURKSTAT which is the major producer of statistics, in case they show no interest, as in the past, it is noted that, non-profit NGO’s, universities, foundations and  research centers and even private firms which wish to commercially exploit the value added, are the options for housing TAR-İST.

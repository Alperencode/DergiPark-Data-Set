Makale Başlığı: ASALA Terrorist Organization and Acts of Terrorism
Özet: "Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia" (ASALA, for short) was a terrorist organization created on January 20, 1975, in Beirut by Armenians. Like every other ter-rorist organization, ASALA needed financial support to carry out terrorist attacks. To receive those financial resources, ASALA made various relationships throughout the countries in Asia, Europe, and America. Adopting the Marxist-Leninist ideology, ASALA choses the Turkish Republic and its diplomats as their target. The Armenian terror to-wards the Turks began with the assassinations of two Turkish diplomats, Mehmet Baydar and Bahadır Demir, in Santa Barbara, United States of America. ASALA continued its terrorist attacks on Turkish citizens until the terrorist attack in France's Orly Interna-tional Airport. After the Orly International Airport attack on July 15, 1983, ASALA lost the support provided by various countries. Fifty-five diplomats of the Turkish Republic died in the attacks carried out by ASALA. To prevent attacks, the Turkish Government took the necessary steps to protect its diplomats and embassies. While ASALA was slowly losing its support, the name "Kurdistan Workers' Party" (PKK) became more prominent. This study aimed to show the ASALA terrorist organization and attacks on Turkish citi-zens.

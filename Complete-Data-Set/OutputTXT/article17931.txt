Makale Başlığı: Chlorine and ozone applications used for fruit and vegetable disinfection in tourism accommodation facilities
Özet: Samples of vegetable and fruit were taken from the kitchens of tourism accommodation facilities and microbiological analyses were made. The samples were analysed after being disinfected with 100 ppm chlorine for 2-10 minutes and with 2 ppm ozone for 2-10 minutes. In the examined vegetables and fruit samples, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes were examined in terms of microorganisms. Before disinfection, E. coli was detected in all 30 samples: E. coli O157 in 8 samples, Salmonella spp. in 4 samples, and L. monocytogenes in 3 samples. As a result of disinfection applications with 100 ppm chlorine for 2 minutes, E. coli decreased by more than 45%. Salmonella spp. was detected in 1 sample and E. coli O157 was detected in 2 samples. After disinfection applications with 2 ppm ozone for 2 minutes, E. coli decreased by more than  60%. A decrease of more than 70% was observed in E. coli. after disinfection applications with 100 ppm chlorine for 5 minutes. As a result of disinfection applications with 2 ppm ozone for 5 minutes, E. coli decreased by more than 85%. No bacteria were found in the samples after disinfection with 100 ppm chlorine and 2 ppm ozone for 10 minutes. It was observed that there was a decrease in the microorganism loads as a result of the chlorination and ozonation processes of the vegetable and fruit samples.

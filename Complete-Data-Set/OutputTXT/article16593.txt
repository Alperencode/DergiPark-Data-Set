Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Customer Complaints Management of Apparel Businesses on Repurchase Behavior and Brand Trust: The Example of Denim Pants
Özet: In order to assure customer happiness, boost customer loyalty, and consistently sell products to the same client, ready-made clothes enterprises must now manage customer complaints effectively due to the competitive environment of today. Due to their strength, longevity, and resistance to changes in fashion, denim trousers—which are a staple in every closet—are the focus of this study. The study looks into how brand trust and customer repurchase rates are affected by how businesses respond to customer complaints about their denim pants items. A questionnaire was created in order to accomplish this goal. A total of 395 denim trousers buyers, 207 women and 188 men, between the ages of 21 and 56, who resided in the province of Istanbul, participated in the survey. Based on the data collected, it has been determined that consumers are impacted by the effectiveness and efficiency of the brand's complaint management, and this circumstance affects their propensity to make additional purchases.

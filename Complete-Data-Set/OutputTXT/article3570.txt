Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Relationship Between Upper Extremity Musculoskeletal Problems and Occupational Burnout in Hairdressers
Özet: The aim of this study is to investigate which body parts are common musculoskeletal problems in hairdressers and to examine the relationship between upper extremity musculoskeletal problems and the level of occupational burnout. This cross-sectional study included 78 hairdressers with congenital or chronic musculoskeletal disease, no pregnancy, and no traumatic musculoskeletal problems in the last 6 months. After the demographic information of the participants was obtained, the Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire (CMDQ) was used to determine the musculoskeletal system problems and the effects of these problems on work; Occupational burnout levels were evaluated with the Burnout Scale-Short Form (BS-SF). Of the participants, 26 (33.3%) were female hairdressers and 52 (66.7%) were male hairdressers. The body parts of the hairdressers with the highest musculoskeletal pain/suffering/discomfort were neck (n=46) and waist (n=45) regions. There was a moderate positive correlation between the musculoskeletal system problems and occupational burnout levels of the participants (r=0.387, p<0.01), and a high level positive correlation between upper extremity musculoskeletal problems and occupational burnout levels (r=0.584; p= 0.008) was recorded. Musculoskeletal disorders, especially upper extremity problems, were encountered in hairdressers. In addition, it is seen that musculoskeletal disorders and occupational burnout are closely related concepts. Implementing preventive rehabilitation programs for hairdressers and making ergonomic arrangements in the workplace may have positive effects on the musculoskeletal system and thus on professional satisfaction and pleasure.

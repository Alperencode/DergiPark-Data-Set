Makale Başlığı: Building A Livable Society in The Context of Hadiths
Özet: One of the biggest goals of the religion of Islam is undoubtedly to build a society where people can live in peace and happiness. In order to realize this purpose, Almighty Allah sent the Qur'an as a book of life and Muhammad (pbuh) as a guide. The Messenger of God built a strong and livable society by realizing the greatest social change in the history of humanity in a short period of time such as twenty-three years, which is the time of his prophethood. Thanks to the method he applied, a period that was accepted as the age of happiness lived in the history of Islam. In this study, the methods applied by the Prophet (pbuh) in building a livable society were examined within the framework of the information in the hadith sources; in the context of hadiths, the universal general principles of building a livable and strong society have been tried to be revealed.

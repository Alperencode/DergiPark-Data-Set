Makale Başlığı: THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE RESEARCH ON YUNUS EMRE AND THE NECESSITY OF DIVAN PUBLICATIONS BASED ON A SINGLE COPY
Özet: The research on Yunus Emre begin with Fuat Köprülü’s work called Türk Edebiyatında İlk Mutasavvıflar (Early Mystics in Turkish Literature) (1919). After that date, many studies have been done about Yunus and his works. However, language studies on his works are insufficient. In addition, independent publications of the copies other than Fatih, Karaman and Bursa have not been made yet. In Turcology studies, works with more than one copy are generally studied with the edition critical method. Although this method is convenient for literary researchers, it is not useful for linguistic studies. Considering the importance of even one suffix in linguistic studies, the value of studying each copy of such texts will be better understood. A well-known Yunus Emre poem and its crown couplet can be looked at as an example to make the subject more understandable. It is the poem that is taking place in Fatih, Austria, Turkish Historical Association, Vatican, Vahitpaşa 2, Nuruosmaniye copies with the crown couplet “Gelin tanış olalım işi kolay kılalım / Sevelim sevilelim dünya kimseye kalmaz”. The first line of the couplet differs in different manuscripts, especially in terms of vocabulary. In the manuscripts, the verb is not tanış ol-, but danışık / tanışık / tanşuk et- which means "to consult". The verb kıl- is never used. The verbs tut- / güt- are used instead of kıl-. Kolay / oñat and iş / iz word preferences are also other differences. Making philological publications based on a single copy will contribute to issues such as dating the copies, identifying the main copies, determining the poet's breadth vocabulary. It will also reveal the characteristics of language and dialect of the period and place in which the work was copied.

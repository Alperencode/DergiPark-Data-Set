Makale Başlığı: Theodore Metochites and Chora Monastery Church (Kariye Mosque)
Özet: This article focuses on two related issues: first, the political, intellectual, and cultural identity ofTheodore Metochites, the founder of the Chora Monastery Church (the Kariye Mosque), and second,the importance of the frescoes and mosaics of the Chora. Theodore Metochites, whose namefeatures almost exclusively in relation to the subject of Chora, worked on and wrote about ancientGreek philosophy and science in the tradition of the great 11th century Byzantine philosopherMichael Psellos. The article compares the frescoes and mosaics of the Chora, which are a productof the power and will of Metochites, to Renaissance art. The common analysis of Byzantine art—that it is static, unchanging, and constantly repeating certain clichés that present an “orientalist”point of view—is considered and the accuracy of this analysis was discussed. The article demonstratesthat Theodore Metochites was not only a patron of the arts but also one of the most talentedstatesmen and intellectuals of his time, under whose auspices the importance and varietyof art in the Chora is described as the greatest artistic achievement of the Palaiologan Period.

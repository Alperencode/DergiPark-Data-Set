Makale Başlığı: Amorium Inner Wall Excavations (2020-2021) Beyliks and Early Ottoman Period Glazed Ceramic Finds
Özet: In this study, the glazed ceramic finds, consisting of 35 mouth and base fragments, which were found in the Amorium City excavation, was discussed. The aforementioned finds were discovered in the Inner Wall area located in the Upper City section of the city between years 2020-2021.  With this study, it is aimed to identify and date the glazed ceramic finds. The glazed ceramic finds of the Inner Wall were handled in three different groups, as monochrome glazed ware, monochrome sgrafitto ware and polychrome sgraffito ware, considering the production techniques. Inner Wall glazed ceramic finds, which exhibit similar clay, slip, glaze and form characteristics, seem to belong to the same production group. The finds, which were identified by comparing them with similar samples in Central Anatolia and Western Anatolia, were dated by considering similar samples and the areas where they were found within the Inner Wall area.Amorium glazed ceramic finds are important in terms of contributing to the studies on ceramic finds as well as providing data on the Turkish-Islamic period settlement in the city. As a matter of fact, the data on the ceramic finds in Central Anatolia are still insufficient to comprehend the production and trade of the region during the transition period covering the Late Byzantine, Beyliks and Early Ottoman periods. In this matter that needs to be clarified, it is aimed that the Amorium glazed ceramic finds will contribute to the studies carried out in this area.

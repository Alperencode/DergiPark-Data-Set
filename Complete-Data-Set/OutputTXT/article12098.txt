Makale Başlığı: THE ROMANIAN FRONT IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE QUESTION OF THE LOOTS
Özet: Romania joined the Allied Powers in the First World War. Thus, the Romanian Front was opened. When the front was opened, the Central Powers sent their troops to Romania. Although Romania was the first to attack, the Central Powers soon gained the upper hand on the front. The Romanian army began to retreat north towards the Seret River, the present-day Moldovan border. As a result, most of its territory fell into the Central Powers’ hands.When the dominance in Romania passed into the hands of the Central Powers, some of the seized materials along with the materials left by the Romanian army during the retreat were shared as booty by the Central Powers. The Ottoman State also obtained booty and sent them home. A small part of the country’s needs were met. The materials found as loot were used on the facades. Even if Romania lost its own war, when the Allied Powers, of which it was a member, won the First World War, it demanded back some of the materials sent to the country. As a result, a commission was established and they took back some materials.In this article, The activities of Turkish soldiers in Romania, the process of obtaining and sending the booty, what happened in the Romanian Front in the First World War were examined and tried to be researched by using archival sources and other copyrighted works.

The rate of thinking that fever is due to infection and the rate of learning antipyretic information from books and academic publications were statistically higher in the families of undergraduate education group than in the families of basic education group (p:0.019, p:0.010, p:0.005, respectively).ConclusionAlthough parents' knowledge levels and right thoughts about fever have improved over time, we still think that the knowledge level of the society should be increased from the right sources on this subject.

Makale Başlığı: Structural Inequalities in Educational Leadership: Addressing Social and Professional Identities and Recognitional Power
Özet: In  this  article,  we  aim  to  work  toward  a  rich  theoretical  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  social  identity,  professional  identity,  and  school  leadership  in  the  context  of  recognitional  power.  We  approach  the  relationship  the  study  constructs  by  problematizing  the  traditional  areas  of  leadership  literature  that  is  marked  by  veneration  of  leadership  and   its   functional   toolkit   that   includes   traits,   attitudes,   behaviors,   efficiency,  productivity,  mastery,  etc.  as  antecedents  to  the  leadership  process.  In  addition,  the  article  aims  to  capture  the  intersection  of  professional  and  social  identity  considering  the  relations  of  domination  and  everyday  practices  of  recognition.  These  goals  are  reflected  in  two  research questions: (1) How do we understand the relationship between school  leadership,  social  identity  and  professional  identity?  (2)  How  do  we approach social and professional identities in educational leadership studies  in  terms  of  recognitional  power?  We  propound  that  leadership  literature should include diverse epistemic approaches, problematize the structural  inequalities  and  the  institutionalized  relations  of  recognition  and  recognitional  power,  and  problematize  the  intersection  of  social  identity, professional identity, and recognitional power.

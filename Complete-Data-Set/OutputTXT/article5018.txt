Makale Başlığı: Modified Carrier Based PWM Control for Grid-Connected Single Phase Transformerless Inverter
Özet: In this paper, the performance comparison of different carrier signal based modulation techniques is presented for grid-connected single phase H6-II type transformerless inverter for same switching frequency. Here, carrier signals used in multi-level and mostly three-phase inverters and new carrier signals derived from them are extended for controlling single-phase H6-II type inverter. System performance is evaluated with observed inverter output voltage and current waveforms, measured current and voltage, and calculated efficiency and total harmonic distortion (THB) for the created carrier-based pulse width modulation (PWM) control techniques. Test results show that modified carrier based PWM control techniques performs better than the traditional technique in terms of efficiency, THB and leakage current.

Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL POWER AND ANTHROPOMORPHISM ON VALUATION OF POSSESSIONS
Özet: Previous literature indicated that experiencing social power increases one’s focus on the self and promotes material values. Anthropomorphism provides a social environment which increases communal orientation. Thus, it is essential to search the role of anthropomorphism in relations between social power and behavior. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and social power on our connections with our possessions. It is supposed that the interaction effect on our connections with our possessions, which is measured as willingness to accept (WTA), will be through separation distress. A mediating model was applied to test the supposed effects. Data were gathered in 2018 from a sample of students via 2 experiments. The results of the study have shown that social power influences WTA when there is no anthropomorphism. Nevertheless, when there is anthropomorphism, social power has not such an effect on WTA. The findings of the study have important contributions to the literature on both anthropomorphism and social power.

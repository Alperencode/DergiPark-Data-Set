Makale Başlığı: ABU AL-YŪSR MUHAMMAD ALPAZDAWĪ'S APPROACH TO THE ISSUE OF ADAM'S PROPHETY
Özet: Abū al-Yūsr Muhammad al-Pazdawī is one of the theologians whose identity and books have been studied very little, although he came from a scholarly family that adhered to the Hanafi-Maturidi tradition. Pezdavi sees the institution of prophethood as a human, social and social necessity. Pezdavi discussed the issue of Adam's prophethood, which is not much discussed in other theological books, and tried to prove that Adam was a prophet by citing the evidences of some of the Mu'tazila that he was not a prophet. Some Mu'tazilites base their view that Adam could not be a prophet on the verse that states that he rebelled against God, that he would not be worthy of prophethood because of rebellion, and that there were no people to be sent as prophets to them when Adam was created. Pezdavi, on the other hand, states that Adam became a prophet, that Eve was with him after Adam was created, that Eve and Adam himself needed a prophet and the divine decrees that he would bring, and that all the minor and major characteristics of the prophets adopted by the Mu'tazilites. It is based on proving the wrong understanding of innocence in the sense of being protected from sins. Unanimously accepted by Pezdavi Sunni theology and theologians, He fiercely defended Adam's becoming a prophet against some Mu'tazilite theologians who did not agree with this idea.

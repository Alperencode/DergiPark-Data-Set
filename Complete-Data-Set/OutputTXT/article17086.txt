Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Muhtar Avezov’s Story Named Kökserek in the Light of Adaptive Animal Behaviors
Özet: Muhtar Avezov is one of the most important names of 20th century contemporary Kazakh literature with his researches on Kazakh folk culture and general Turkish literature, establishing Kazakh literary language and developing Western style prose. The author who produces works in literary genres such as novels, plays and translations, has twenty-seven stories published at the same time. One of these stories is Kökserek, which was published in 1929. The story in question is almost a pinnacle for the author’s storytelling, as it not only deals with the Kazakh geography and the people living there, but also highlights the animals and reveals that this geography has a great wealth of life. The story is also very striking in that the events in the fictitious world are based on the behaviors of the wolf named Kökserek and other animals. The animals in the story exhibit the behaviors they need to do for their lives, that is, the types of behavior called adaptive behavior to adapt to life. This study shows how adaptive behavior types such as feeding, shelter-seeking, struggle, breeding, attention, responsibility, invitation to attention, movement with the group, imitation, social observation and examination of wolves are included in the fiction in Muhtar Avezov’s story named Kökserek. This study also aims to analyze animals in fiction through these behavior types.

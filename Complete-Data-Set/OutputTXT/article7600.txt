Makale Başlığı: RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF TURKISH VERSION OF CHILDREN’S HAND USE EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CHILDREN WITH HEMIPARETIC CEREBRAL PALSY
Özet: Purpose: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a non-progressive lesion in the developing brain due to prenatal, perinatal and postnatal causes; however, it is a permanent motor function, posture and movement development disorder that can change with age. Our aim in this study is to investigate the cross-cultural adaptation, validation and reliability of Children’s Hand-use Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ).Methods: Ninety-five children between 6 and 18 years of age with hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy (CP) were included in this study. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine their motor levels, Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) was used to determine their manual ability, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) was used to determine their disability level and Children’s Hand-use Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ) was used to determine their hand use ability.Results: Investigating reliability of CHEQ, 35 children with hemiparetic CP were evaluated 1week interval. The test-retest reliability was described by using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent and divergent construct validities were assessed by examining the Spearman’s correlation coefficients of the CHEQ compared to MACS and GMFCS and PEDI. Reliability were tested by using ICC and found to be 1.00. The ‘activities performed independently’ section of the CHEQ had statistically significant and good correlations (p=0.001) with the MACS and the self-care section of the PEDI. It had statistically significant but weak correlation (p=0.001) with the GMFCS

Makale Başlığı: EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION (ECMO) FOR COVID-19: UPDATED 2021 ELSO GUIDELINES SUMMARY
Özet: This article summarizes updated guidance on the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure due to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).• V-V ECMO can be used in patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure with expected outcomes comparable to patients supported with V-V ECMO prior to the pandemic.• V-A ECMO can be used in patients with COVID-19 and severe heart failure; but experience is more limited.• Mobile ECMO can be implemented and conducted safely for COVID-19 patients.• ECMO centers should be organized to coordinate patient referrals in geographic areas wherever possible.• As far as possible, patient selection criteria should be combined across a geographic region.• Contraindications to ECMO use should become more stringent as ECMO capacity decreases.• Data presentation is crucial to facilitate research and improve understanding of optimal ECMO care for patients with COVID-19.• Although some centers have increased their anticoagulation targets, bleeding remains a concern and there are no data to suggest deviation from traditional anticoagulation targets.• There are no data to suggest deviations from traditional ECMO practices such as blood product transfusion thresholds, tracheostomy, endotracheal extubation, rehabilitation, cannulation configuration, or ventilator management.• The potential discontinuation of ECMO in the event of perceived futility should be openly discussed with patients and surrogate decision makers.• Rarely, when ECMO support is required for severe ARDS, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory disease in children, ECMO patient selection and management should follow conventional guidelines.

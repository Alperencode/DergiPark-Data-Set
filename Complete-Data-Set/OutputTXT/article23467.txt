Özet: This study is meant to reveal how protest orientation is reflected in musical works. For this purpose, rap music was chosen as the research focus. Including the history of rap music, the study discusses the characteristics of this music genre. As a sample, 5 songs by Sarp Palaur, known as Şanışer, who has been on the rise especially recently, were selected. The songs were selected based on the words used and the topics covered and were subjected to content analysis in accordance with the purpose of the study. Through the study of protest rap music, it was revealed how topics such as political discourse, equality, and justice are treated and presented in this music genre, which is especially popular among young people. This type of music is transmitted to the listeners by using new media channels, which makes the processing of the messages more uncontrollably reaching the listeners more important compared to traditional methods. The analysis was carried out in the context of the characteristics of the language used and the visual elements used in the video clips. In conclusion, it was found that the critical aspect of the songs prevails and thoughts are transferred to the listeners along with a sense of rebellion. In one of the five songs examined, this transfer of thoughts takes place in a constructive manner accompanied by positive emotions, while in two songs critical language is at the forefront and negative emotions outweigh.

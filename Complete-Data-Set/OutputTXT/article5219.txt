Makale Başlığı: An Investigation of Secondary School Students’ Cognitive Structures in the Subject of Life Skills
Özet: The aim of this research is to reveal the cognitive structures and explanation situations of secondary school students for life skills. The study is a descriptive survey model in quantitative research methods. The sample of the study consisted of 189 secondary school students.  The Word Association Test (WAT) was used as the data collection tool. Six keywords (communication, entrepreneurship, teamwork, creativity, analytical thinking, and decision-making) that form life skills were included in order to create the WAT. In the analysis process of WAT, a frequency table has been made to show which words or concepts are repeated for which keyword. According to the frequency table, a conceptual relational network that revealed the cognitive structures of secondary school students was drawn. It was determined that secondary school students could not produce enough words regarding life skills concepts. The number of students who gave answers especially about creative thinking and decision-making concepts was quite limited. Based on the results of the research, it is recommended to develop the diversity of concepts in students' cognitive structures for life skills concepts and their conceptual knowledge of life skills with applied activities in different courses.

Makale Başlığı: Enlightenment Ideology Awry in Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
Özet: Though regarded as a philosophical movement of the 17th and18th centuries, in the words of Adorno and Horkheimer, the idea ofEnlightenment has represented throughout the history of mankindman’s effort to control nature. In today’s world, the control andmanipulation of nature has reached the point of self-annihilationwith the use of advanced mass deception apparatuses and creation ofsimulacra replacing and surpassing reality. Philip Dick’s Do AndroidsDream of Electric Sheep is a science-fiction novel depicting a futurepost-apocalyptic society in which the humanity’s effort to controlnature through science, technology, and mass deception ends with analmost total extinction of animal life, fatal damage of our planet, andgreat difficulty to distinguish between the real and the simulacrum.This article proposes that, with its over-kipplized setting, physicallyand psychologically defective citizens, powerful mass deceptionapparatuses and with its simulacra surpassing their real counterparts,the post-human world of the novel represents the malfunctioningof Enlightenment ideals and the self-annihilating end that theEnlightenment ideology brings humanity to. The article studies theseissues within the theoretical framework of Horkheimer and Adorno’sidea of Enlightenment and Jean Baudrillard’s idea of the hyperreal,simulation and simulacra.

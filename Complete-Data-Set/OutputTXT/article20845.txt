Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Cognitive Absorption and Digital Literacy Skills among Secondary School Students
Özet: This study aimed to reveal the effects of secondary school students’ cognitive absorption levels on their digital literacy. In line with this purpose, the correlational method was used in the study. The study group of the research consisted of 455 secondary school students. The data were collected from students studying in different state schools in Sakarya, Turkey in the 2019-2020 academic year. The data collection tools employed in the study are as follows:  the personal information form developed by the researchers, “Cognitive Absorption Scale”, and “Digital Literacy Scale”. In the study, the relationship between the variables of digital literacy and cognitive absorption was investigated through simple correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. In the present study conducted in line with these indicators, the effect of the cognitive absorption levels of secondary school students on their digital literacy was investigated in terms of cognitive absorption factors (curiosity, pleasure, attention, and time). As a result of the analyses performed in the study, it was determined that the variables of curiosity in the first place, pleasure in the second place, and attention in the third place statistically significantly predicted students’ digital literacy status. It was also found that the time variable had no effect on the digital literacy.

Özet: Construction sector is an important component of social and economical development of Turkey. On the other hand; it has a significant role on the environmental impacts. Ecological design approaches were discussed to reduce this impacts and various methods have been created. In Turkey despite the numerous and rapid construction of housing, it has been observed that ecological methods are not taken into account in housing construction. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the selected existing housing group with designed ecological performance evaluation model and determine their ecological performance.Therefore, an ecological design model for housing groups that consists of effective use of raw materials, effective use of energy, effective use of water and environmental protection is developed via literature research on the impact of the ecological design. In the case study, 30 existing housing groups in Darıca, Kocaeli are analysed with the model. The selected housing groups performed 36% in effective use of raw materials, 52% in effective use of energy, 30% in effective use of water and 27% in environmental protection.

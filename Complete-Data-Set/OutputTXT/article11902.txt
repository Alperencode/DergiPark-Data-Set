Makale Başlığı: Developing a Scale to Determine Secondary School Students' Interests in the Environment
Özet: This study aims to develop a scale to determine the level of interest of secondary school students in the environment. In this study, the scanning method, one of the quantitative research designs, was used. Data were collected from 750 secondary school students for exploratory factor analysis. A “Secondary School Environmental Interest Scale (SSEIS)” consisting of 25 items with three factors was created. SSEIS reliability coefficient was calculated as α=.86. When the data collected from 410 secondary school students were analyzed for the confirmatory factor analysis performed to confirm the relationship between the dimensions obtained from the EFA, it was supported that the SSEIS is a three-factor scale. These findings revealed that the developed scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool to determine secondary school students' interest in the environment.

Makale Başlığı: User profiling for TV program recommendation based on hybrid television  standards using controlled clustering with genetic algorithms and artificial neural  networks
Özet: In this paper, an earlier method proposed by the authors to make smart recommendations utilizing artificial  intelligence and the latest technologies developed for the television area is expanded further using controlled clustering  with genetic algorithms  CCGA . For this purpose, genetic algorithms  GAs , artificial neural networks  ANNs , and  hybrid broadcast broadband television  HbbTV  are combined to get the users' television viewing habits and to create  profiles. Then television programs are recommended to the users based on that profiling. The data gathered by the  developed HbbTV application for previous studies are reused in this study. These data are employed to cluster users.  The number of clusters is found by CCGA, a method proposed in this paper. For each cluster formed by CCGA, a  separate ANN is designed to learn the viewing habits of the users of the corresponding cluster. The weight matrices  are initialized also by GA. The recommendations produced using the proposed model are then presented by the same  HbbTV application developed by the authors. Clustering with GAs gives better results when compared to the well-known  K-means clustering algorithm.

Makale Başlığı: THE CLASSIFICATION OF SIGNS IN FURÛQ LITERATURE
Özet: Peirce (1839-1914), systematically classifies sign types according to the categories of being. He argues that abstract concepts can reach their clear meanings only when they are examined as signs and proposes a unique understanding method that reveals the difference of abstract concepts from other words. In this respect, a connection can be established between Peirce's semiotics and the science of furûq, which examines the meaning differences of closely related words. In Peirce semiotics, classification of the signs, which is the agent of the act of representation, as an independent phenomenon is important in terms of presenting a systematic model. In this context, the viewpoint of Islamic scholars on  sign can be followed, based on the differences in meaning between the concepts that have the meaning of representation in the works of furûq. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to find and classify the signs mentioned in furûq. Accordingly, in the first part, the relationship between the furûq and semiotics is mentioned and Peirce's sign types are explained in terms of being a model. In the second part, based on the semantic differences between the words that have the meaning of representation, the signs mentioned by Islamic scholars are classified.

Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION of the CORRELATION BETWEEN POWER CONSUMPTION and SURFACE ROUGHNESS in the TURNING of HARDENED DIN 1.2367 STEEL
Özet: Increasing demands in the industrial sector have also increased costs. The share of electricity costs is quite high in these cost increases. Therefore, electricity expenses have become an important phenomenon in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, brought efficiency to the fore increasing costs in the manufacturing sector. It is tried to give data that will contribute to productivity in manufacturing sectors with this research. The influences of cutting parameters that these are depth of cut, feed rate, and speed of cutting were examined on roughness of surface, power consumption and current of machine through turning of DIN 1.2367 steel using cutting tools are made of coated carbide under dry test case in this study. This study attempts to develop prediction and optimization models to analyze the effect of turning parameters on roughness of surface, power consumption, and ultimately roughness of surface and simultaneous consumption of power. The values of total power consumption were calculated by time of machining and instantaneous current values in the study. The study results indicated that feed rate has the most important influence on output parameters. The value of surface roughness raised with increasing values of feed rate (56.86 % feed rate). It has been examined that grinding quality surface is obtained, especially at low feed values. The power consumption value increases with rising cutting speed and cut of depth (38.50 % cutting depth) values. Also, the rising in the depth of cut values is effective in the increase in power consumption values.

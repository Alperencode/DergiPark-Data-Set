Makale Başlığı: Prioritization of Danger Sources in the Dining Hall Section of a Public Institution with Rank-Based Weighting Methods
Özet: In this study, three different ranking-based weighting methods, which are used in criterion weighting, were applied within the scope of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, in order to prioritize the danger sources that need risk assessment in the kitchen section of a public institution's dining hall. The aim of the study is to determine and prioritize the danger sources for which risk assessment should be performed, by reflecting the views of all people responsible for the kitchen section. In the literature, it is seen that MCDM methods are generally used in risk assessment. With this study, for the first time, the danger sources in the kitchen area that need to be risk assessment were identified and prioritized. In this context, the importance weights of these danger sources were determined by considering the evaluations of different responsible persons regarding the priorities of the danger sources, using the Rank Sum (RS), Rank Exponent (RE) and Rank Reciprocal (RR) methods. Then, the different weightings obtained from the three methods are combined with the geometric mean operator. In this way, a risk assessment plan for danger sources was created, reflecting the perspectives of different responsible people. The approach proposed in this study can be used to prioritize the danger sources to be considered in risk assessment in cafes, restaurants, patisseries or dining halls of private-public institutions. In this respect, the study is an original study that can contribute to real life applications and literature.

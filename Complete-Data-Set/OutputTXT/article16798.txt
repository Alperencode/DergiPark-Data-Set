Makale Başlığı: Realism As A Fictional Context and Some Criticism On The Subject
Özet: Realism is a way of conveying what is seen with a simple definition for visual arts. Terms such as realism and reality can be confused because they create different openings in the human mind. Each work of art has its own spiritual "truth", but the closeness of art to "realism" is a more formal, visible feature. Realism is a form of visual formatting that is related to the language of the work and it has a formal harmony between art and the visible world.In this article, it is aimed to examine the positioning of realism in the painting historical process in general and the criticisms developed against the use of realistic formatting. For this purpose, definitions such as "representation", "representational art" and "the act of establishing similarity in painting" were examined. Thus, it is aimed to look at the subject from a broader perspective. The article is composed of sub-titles "Image and Representation", "Fictionally and Ideologically Realism in Painting", "Some Criticisms of Realism". Since the concept of realism is used in fields such as politics and education, and in other branches of art, a limitation has been introduced based on the art of painting. . Scope of work; written and visual sources related to the subject were examined.

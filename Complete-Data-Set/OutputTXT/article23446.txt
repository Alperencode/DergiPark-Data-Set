Makale Başlığı: Koenzim Q10 ve Hesperidinin Ratlarda Alt Ekstremite İskemi-Reperfüzyon Hasarında TAS ve TOS Düzeylerine Etkisi
Özet: It was aimed to determine the effects of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and Hesperidin (HESP) on TAS and TOS levels in lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. In the study, 28 Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 200-250 g were divided into 4 groups as Control (C), Ischemia reperfusion (IR), IR+CoQ10 and IR+HESP groups. Before ischemia was induced in the IR+CoQ10 group, 0.5mL CoQ10 was administered at a dose of 10mg/kg 3 times with 8-hour intervals, and to the IR+HESP group at a dose of 100mg/kg, 0.5mL Hesperidin was administered 3 times at 8-hour intervals by gastric gavage. Except for the control group, a tourniquet was applied to the left lower extremities and 2 hours of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion were applied to the other 3 groups under anesthesia. At the end of the study, blood samples were taken from the rats under anesthesia and total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were measured. While TOS level was higher in the IR group than in all groups, it was determined that CoQ10 and HESP application with ischemia significantly decreased these levels compared to the IR group, and antioxidants applied together with ischemia increased the TAS levels statistically significantly compared to the IR group. It was determined that it showed protective effects by decreasing the CoQ10 and HESP TOS level and increasing the TAS level in experimentally induced ischemia-reperfusion injury of the lower extremity in rats.

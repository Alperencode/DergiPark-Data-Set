Makale Başlığı: PHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS of FOUR W UMA BINARIES
Özet: In this work, the light curves of NSVS2175434, V783 And, ASAS J020753+2034.1 and NR CAM W Uma type eclipsing binary star systems were obtained by using 0.5 meter ATA50 telescope in Atatürk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center (ATASAM). The orbital period variations of the systems were analyzed using the "timing" method. Only the O-C diagram of NR Cam was performed because the eclipse times of the other systems in the literature are not sufficient. When the O-C diagram of the NR Cam system is examined, no clear change has been observed for the time being. However, more observational data are needed to understand whether changes will occur in the future.

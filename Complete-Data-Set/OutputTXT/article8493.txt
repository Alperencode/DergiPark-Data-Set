Makale Başlığı: Macroeconomic Determinants of Total Factor Productivity:  An Analysis on the Example of OECD Countries
Özet: This  study  examines  the  macroeconomic  determinants  of  total  factor  productivity  (TFP),  a  critical  factor  for  sustainable  economic  growth,  within  the  scope  of  the  dataset,  including  the 1990–2017 period and 27 OECD countries. The primary goal is to provide an up-to-date perspective on the literature within the scope of the analyzed period and country and provide an infrastructure for policy sets that will contribute to long-term economic growth. We use a two-stage empirical application in this context. First, the economic stability index, innovation index, technology  diffusion  index,  education  index,  and  economic  freedom index are computed. Subsequently, the effect of these variables on TFP is investigated using panel regression methods. Results reveal that the technology diffusion index, which depicts the  mechanisms  of  technology  transfer  from  country  to  country,  is  the  most  important  factor  determining  TFP.  This  variable  is  followed  by  the  education and innovation indices. Another important finding of the study is that the economic stability and freedom indices have a significant impact on TFP. However, the magnitude of these effects is smaller than that of other variables.

Makale Başlığı: STUDIES ON MULTILINGUALISM AND CROSSLINGUISTICS
Özet: Due to the increasing use of social media, commercial relations, multicultural societies and many other factors in recent years, multilingualism is one of the most common situations. In this multilingual changing world, Turkish gradually takes its place in crosslinguistics-influence researches. Therefore, this study deals with foreign language learning in multilingualism contexts, which are important factors on the subject, such as transfer, third language learning models and crosslinguistics-influence, by presenting a Turkish compilation from the literature. According to the results that have been searched and developed in Ankara University Teaching Foreign Languages department, although the source of transfer in multilingual language acquisition processes is not clearly known, the acquired languages have a great effect on the learning of third languages. Findings on learning patterns are also unclear and still subject to improvement because crosslinguistics-influence has many different bases and variables. Multilingualism and crosslinguistics-influence studies should be increased in our country and in the world by including linguistic diversity.

Makale Başlığı: Phenolic compound profile, and evaluation of biological properties of Bassia muricata (L.) Asch. aerial part
Özet: Current study verifies the biological efficiency of Bassia muricata (Chenopodiaceae vent), a wild plant in the Algerian desert. MeOH extract (70%) of the aerial parts of B. muricata was tested for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. In addition to determining the value of the SPF and its effectiveness as hypoglycemia through a glucose uptake assay by yeast cells. Its phenolic content was also verified by quantitative estimations and RP-HPLC-UV analysis. MeOH extract of B. muricata exhibited antioxidant effects, where it showed good to moderate free radical inhibition activity towards both DPPH• and OH•, and this corresponded with excellent anti-hemolytic activity. As well as being a Fe2+ and molybdate reducing agent, the extract showed moderate photoprotective activity with SPFSpectrophootometric=18.89±0.005. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and enhances glucose uptake. MeOH extract of B. muricata showed remarkable antibacterial activity against B. subtilis, L. innocua, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. It did not give efficacy against S. typhimurium. Its phenolic content on the other hand was verified by quantitative estimations and RP-HPLC-UV analysis, which revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid, p-coumarin acid, gallic acid as a major phenolic compounds. These results showed that B. muricata could be useful as source of bioactive compounds for food, the pharmaceutical industry and the manufacture of cosmetics.

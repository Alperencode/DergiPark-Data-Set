Makale Başlığı: Symbol Hermeneutıcs in Paul Ricoeur
Özet: According to Ricoeur, linguistic expressions are mostly obscure, blurred, and not explicit. In language, another meaning conceals itself within the obvious meaning of discourse. Naming this polysemous structure in language as a symbol, Ricoeur sees metaphor as a transitional stage to symbol in terms of creating polysemy. He determines the interpretation as a thought activity that grasps this polysemy in the symbol and decodes these meanings. He defines hermeneutics as a method for grasping the ambiguity of meaning, diversity of meaning, and abundance of meaning in the symbol. In this context, the aim of this study is to reveal how the symbol hermeneutics emerges in Ricoeur by explaining the relationship between symbol and interpretation, symbol and meaning and symbol and metaphor.

Makale Başlığı: Characterization of High-Pressure Fuel Hose with  Braided Reinforcement
Özet: This study aims to investigate the effect of material type and braiding angle on the performance characteristics of the reinforced multi-layered hose, to manufacture a high-pressure fuel hose. For this purpose, NBR (Acrylo-Nitrile Butadiene rubber)/CPE (chlorinated polyethylene) fuel hose was manufactured using a single-screw extruder and for the production of the reinforcement layer, braiding technology was used. With an attempt to discuss the effect of braiding angle on the performance characteristics of the reinforced multi-layered hose, the speed of the radial braiding machine was altered. E-glass, aramid, carbon, polyester, and basalt yarns were used for the production of the braided layer. Then CPE (chlorinated polyethylene) rubber was extruded for the cover application. Performance properties of the fuel hose such as hardness, ply adhesion, vacuum collapse bursting pressure, and diametric expansion were measured and evaluated according to the requirements of the related standards. The results revealed that, with increased braiding speed, ply adhesion, vacuum collapse, and diametric expansion properties of hoses increase, while hardness, permanent deformation, and bursting pressure of hoses decrease. It has been determined that NBR/Basalt/CPE fuel hose produced in 4m/min braiding speed provided optimum functional and adhesion properties, because of its hardness, permanent deformation, bursting, and vacuum test values at 25°C are within the limit. Additionally, the results were verified by running finite element analysis (FEA) using the ANSYS simulation program.

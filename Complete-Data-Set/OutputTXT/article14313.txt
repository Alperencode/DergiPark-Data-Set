Makale Başlığı: IS SUSTAINABLE NUTRITION SUSTAINABLE FOR ATHLETES?
Özet: Sustainability is the use of existing resources at the required rate to meet the needs by protecting the resources that will be used by future generations. Existing food production systems in the world are not suitable for the concept of sustainability and cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and thus the burden of global warming by consuming existing resources. The increased consumption of animal food as a result of the adoption of the Western-style diet affects the environmental effects negatively. The food choices of athletes, who are among the groups with the highest animal food consumption, have been evaluated in terms of sustainability recently. Athletes who have high performance and want to maintain their standards, follow a nutritional pattern comprising of much more animal-based protein than recommended in general. In addition, the increase in the consumption of frozen, canned and packaged foods, production processes and waste generation related to packaged products increase greenhouse gas emissions. Taking protein, which has an important place in the diet of athletes, from plant sources, adopting a flexitarian nutrition model, avoiding food waste, and contributing to waste management by reducing the consumption of packaged food and beverages can contribute to a sustainable nutrition model.Keywords: : athlete, sports nutrition, sustainability, sustainable nutrition

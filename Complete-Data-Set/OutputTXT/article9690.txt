Makale Başlığı: Chemical Composition and Biological Active Substances from Hazelnut Green Leafy Covers
Özet: This investigation aims to study the perspectives for obtaining natural remedies and food addit­ives from raw plant materials that can be used in food, pharmaceutical, and other industries. The selection of hazelnut green leafy cover as an item is based on the fact that it is a natural organic resource that is now being discarded as waste. In the article, the results are presented about the determination of mineral elements and bioactive compounds in the bio-extracts of 70% ethyl alcohol (BE-III) and distillation water (BE-IV) obtained from the green leafy cover of the plant (Corylus avellane L.) where grow in the north-western region of Azerbaijan. According to our study, BE-III has 25 chemical elements, excluding Rb, for a total of 12.797%, while BE-IV contains 26 chemical elements for a total of 21.347%. Amounts of mac­roelements are 10.4%, and microelements are 2.69% in the content of BE-III, while amounts of macroele­ments are 17.82%, and amounts of microelements are 3.53% in the content of BE-IV. Amounts of organic compounds are 87.2% in the content of BE-III, while their amounts are 78.65% in the content of BE-IV. The amount of Zn, which has antioxidant activity, is 0.009%, and the amount of Se is 0.002% in the con­tent of BE-IV. These values vary in the content of BE-III, the amount of Zn is 0.01%, but the amount of Se is 0.001%. 15 bioactive substances were identified in the content of BE-III bio-extract; however, 5 bioact­ive substances were identified in the content of BE-IV bio-extract. According to our research results, the bio-extract obtained from hazelnut green leafy cover is abundant with antioxidants and bioactive sub­stances with antibacterial activity. For this reason, these bio-extracts can be used as both a food supple­ment and a means of treatment.

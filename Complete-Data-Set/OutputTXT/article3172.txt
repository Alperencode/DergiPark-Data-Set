Makale Başlığı: God and Freewill in Spinoza
Özet: Spinoza is one of the most important philosophers. What makes him famous is his ideas about the God-Universe relation and freedom. Spinoza is a pantheist philosopher. According to Spinoza, everything consists of God, His attributes, and modes. God is the immanent cause of everything that exists and for this reason, there is a necessity in all existence. Every being can only reveal its own power. However, a man who is under the influence of emotions wants to realize things that are beyond his power. According to Spinoza, one can be free and happy only by grasping his own limited power and the essence of Nature.

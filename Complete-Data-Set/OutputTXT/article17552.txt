Makale Başlığı: A Person from Izmir in Contemporary Ceramic Art: Candan Güngör
Özet: Candan Güngör is a ceramic artist who was born and raised in Izmir and received her art education in Izmir. At the same time, she continues her productions as an academician in this city. The fact that Izmir is the most important source of inspiration in ceramic works makes Izmir special for her and her for Izmir.When we look at the works of the artist, we immediately feel the spirit of Izmir. As a western Anatolian city, Izmir's culture, texture, climate, history and geological structure are reflected in Güngör's work. The memory of the city is integrated with the artist's ceramic works. All these works that make up the identity of a city and the artist fed by that city are remarkable elements in Candan Güngör's sculptures. On the other hand, the fact that she produces contemporary works of art with ceramic material, which stand out with its traditional side, makes Güngör important as an artist in the international arena rather than just a well-known local artist in the city where she lives.This study aims to reveal the effects of Candan Güngör's art and also the effect of Izmir as a city on her art. The interview with her is special in that she is being both subject and object that forms the culture and memory of the city she lives in.

Özet: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Breast cancer is caused by a combination of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. In this review, it is aimed to examine the relationship between nutrition which is behavioral and enviromental factors and breast cancer risk. Within the scope of nutrition, milk and product, meat and product, vegetables and fruit, cereal, oil food groups is discussed. Calcium and vitamin D, which are found in milk and dairy products, may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Compounds commonly formed during cooking in red and processed meats, on the other hand, can increase the risk of breast cancer. Vegetables and fruits can reduce the risk of breast cancer thanks to their rich vitamin, polyphenol, carotenoid and fiber content. Similarly, phytoestrogens, phenolic acids, antioxidant vitamins and fiber found in the composition of whole grains can reduce the risk of breast cancer. The results of studies examining on dietary fat intake, fatty acids and breast cancer risk differ. More research is needed to investigate the effects of these food groups on breast cancer risk.

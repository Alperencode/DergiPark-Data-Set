Researchers examining the connection of each field of literature with the other in the world have introduced the concept of comparative literature and considered this concept as the study of works produced by two different cultures. However, in time, studies in the field of comparative literature have shown that not only works belonging to different cultures, but also works belonging to the same culture can be examined. In this study, which will set an example for comparative literature, three poems belonging to the same culture and written as answers are discussed in the context of comparative literature. First of all, the lives of the poets who wrote these poems and the responses/nazires to them, then the similar and different aspects of the mentioned zemin/ground and nazire poems were compared. three poems belonging to the same culture and written as an answer are discussed in the context of comparative literature. From this point of view, the differences in form and meaning in the two works written in the same century are presented to the attention of the readers.

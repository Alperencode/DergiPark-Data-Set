Makale Başlığı: INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF TECHNOLOGY USE WITH HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH ANXIETY IN ADULTS
Özet: With the technological advancements, the domains in which technology is used are also gradually increasing. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship of technology use with health literacy and health anxiety. The research was conducted with 228 individuals, 116 females and 112 males, with a mean age of 42.66±16.63 years, aged 18-65. In the study, the Sociodemographic Information Form, Technology Usage Scale (TUS), Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), and The Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI) were used. It was found that the total score of TUS was positively and weakly correlated with the total score of HLQ and HLQ-1 (access to information), HLQ-2 (understanding information), HLQ-3 (appraising/evaluating), HLS-4 (applying/using). It was determined that there was a very weak negative correlation between TUS total score and HAI total score, HAI-1 (somatic sensitivity and anxiety), HAI-2 (negative disease-related expectations). Based on the results of the study, it was found that as the usage of technology increased, health literacy increased, whereas health anxiety decreased. It is considered that when technology is used for the right purposes and in the right way, it can provide support to individuals' ability to acquire information about health-related concepts and manage their health.

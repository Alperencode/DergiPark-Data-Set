Makale Başlığı: Predictive Role of Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio for Postoperative Pain
Özet: Aim:Postoperative pain is closely associated with acute inflammation caused by the surgical procedure. In our study, the aim was to investigate the correlation between neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a systemic inflammation markerwith postoperative analgesic consumption as a marker of postoperative pain.Material and Method: The study analysed data from cases undergoing septorhinoplasty under general anaesthesia aged from 18-55 years and assessed as class I-II according to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. The demographic data of patients, ASA scores, operation duration and total analgesic consumptionin the postoperative period were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups according to preoperative NLR. Accordingly, patients with NLR <2 were Group 1, while patients with NLR ≥2 were Group 2.Results: The study included a total of 116 cases. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data and operation durations (p>0.05). The mean NLR in Groups 1 and 2 were 1.46±0.29 and 2.64±0.74, respectively. Group 2 were identified to have statistically significantly higher postoperative analgesic consumption compared to Group 1 (p=0.006).Conclusion: In light of data obtained in our study, it was concluded that preoperative NLR may be assessed as a guiding marker for determination of appropriate treatment strategies by predicting postoperative pain.

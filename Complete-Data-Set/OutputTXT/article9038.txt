Personnel selection is one of the problems frequently encountered in both daily life and business life. Personnel selection problems that are expected to be solved by decision-makers or managers in companies are of critical importance to achieving the objectives of the companies. One of the changes that took place in the personnel selection process during the COVID-19 epidemic was the criteria related to personnel selection. In this study, the criteria used in personnel selection were adapted to the COVID-19 epidemic period and applied to the solution of a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problem. The most important criteria used in the selection of personnel were determined by the literature review, and criteria that became important for employers during the epidemic period were added. In the study, the criteria were weighted with the AHP method, and the alternatives were listed with the TOPSIS method.

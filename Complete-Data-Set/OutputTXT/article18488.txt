Makale Başlığı: Econometric Analysis of Türkiye's Foreign Trade in Terms of The Inward Processing Regime
Özet: Countries with strong foreign trade always have the advantage in global competition. In that sense, the foreign trade sector is constantly supported, especially in developing countries. The most important subvention provided within the scope of foreign trade is known as the Inward Processing Regime. The Inward Processing Regime is among the incentives that allow companies to import by providing tax exemption, thus offering companies a competitive advantage. For this reason, this study investigates the long-term relationship between the Inward Processing Regime and foreign trade. The study employs the foreign trade balance, Inward Processing Regime, and exchange rate variables in the econometric model, and uses the monthly data covering the period 2002:01-2021:01. According to the result of the Hatemi-J cointegration test allowing two structural breaks, there is a long-term relationship between the variables. In the time-varying causality analysis, the causality relationship has been observed and interpreted in certain periods against the positive and negative shocks between the variables. As a result of the findings, the study recommends some policy implications for policymakers, market actors, and new researchers.

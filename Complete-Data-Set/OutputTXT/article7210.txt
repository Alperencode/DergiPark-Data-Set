Makale Başlığı: Methylene Blue Removal by Electrooxidation Process Using Ti/IrO2/RuO2 Anode and Stainless Steel Cathode: The Role of Operating Parameters
Özet: This study was carried out to investigate the removal of Methyl Blue dye from synthetically prepared wastewater by a lab-scale electrooxidation process using Ti/IrO2/RuO2 as the anode material and stainless steel as the cathode material. The effect of operating variables, including wastewater initial pH (3.0, natural pH (≈ 5.0), 7.0, 9.0, and 11.0), current density (1.0 mA cm-2, 1.5 mA cm-2, 2.0 mA cm-2, and 2.5 mA cm-2), type of support electrolyte (NaCI, KCI, Na2SO4, and NaNO3), and concentration of support electrolyte (1.0 mM, 1.5 mM, 2.0 mM, and 2.5 mM) on Methyl Blue dye removal efficiency was investigated. In the 30-minute electrochemical treatment, the highest removal (78.31%) of the Methyl Blue dye was obtained at the natural pH (≈5). After determining NaCl as the best-supporting electrolyte with 78.31% removal efficiency as the supporting electrolyte type, the removal efficiency increased from 78.31% to 88.25% by increasing the concentration of NaCl from 1.0 mM to 2.5 mM. As the last parameter whose effect was examined, Methyl Blue dye removal efficiency increased from 78.31% to 88.98% by increasing from 1.0 mA cm-2 to 2.5 mA cm-2 the current density which is one of the operating parameters. Experimental results demonstrated the suitability of the electrooxidation process for the effective removal of Methyl Blue dye using Ti/IrO2/RuO2 anode. Especially in indirect oxidation, it was determined that Methyl Blue dye electrolyzes only in the presence of chloride ions, which act as a redox mediator. Also, it was confirmed that the reaction was affected by pH, chloride concentration and applied current density.

Makale Başlığı: Chocolate Or Fetal Doppler Sonography  For Non-Reactive Non-Stress Test Patterns:  Randomized Prospective Controlled Study
Özet: Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the effect of 20-second MCA Doppler ultrasonography and bitter chocolate on non-stress test (NST) patterns, fetal movements felt by the mother and cesarean delivery rates.Methods: Single pregnancies between 36-41 weeks with non-reactive NST pattern were included in the study and prospectively randomized to Doppler ultrasound, bitter chocolate, and non-intervention control groups. NSTs of the patients at the 5th and 30th minutes were examined.Results: The rate of improvement in the fetal movements felt by the mother did not differ significantly among groups (p ˃ 0.05). The 5th minute reactive NST ratio in the Doppler group was significantly higher (p ˂ 0.05) than in the follow-up and chocolate group. In the chocolate and non-intervention control group, the 5th minute reactive NST ratio did not differ significantly (p ˃ 0.05). In the 30th minute NST, patients with non-reactive results had significantly higher fetal distress rates in the Doppler group compared to the other groups (p ˂ 0.05).Conclusions: We think that with the application of Doppler, the length of hospital stay and accordingly patient’s anxiety will reduce. In addition, the patient should be monitored more carefully in terms of fetal distress because it quickly corrects false non-reactivity.

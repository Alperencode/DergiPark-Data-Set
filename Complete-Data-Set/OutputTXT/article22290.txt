Makale Başlığı: THE TURKISH ADAPTATION OF THE ZOOM EXHAUSTION AND FATIGUE SCALE FOR STUDENTS: A VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY STUDY
Özet: Due to the Covid-19 epidemic announced by the World Health Organization in 2020, there has been a compulsory transition to distance education in educational institutions. The time spent in front of the computer and screen has led to a rapidly increasing problem, which is defined as Zoom fatigue or Zoom exhaustion in the literature. The aim of this study; whether the Turkish version of the "Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue (ZEF) Scale" developed by Fauville, Luo, Queiroz, Bailenson, and Hancock (2021) is a valid and reliable tool to measure students' Zoom exhaustion and fatigue. The study group of the research consists of 310 university students studying in the Department of Information and Document Management (IDM) at state universities in Turkey. The construct validity of the ZEF scale was analyzed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and the factor structure of the scale was analyzed using the LISREL package program. Construct reliability and convergent validity were performed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). As a result of the analyzes, the t values, error variances, standard coefficients and fit indices of the five dimensions in the scale were checked and it was seen that the ZEF scale is a valid and reliable tool to measure the students' Zoom exhaustion and fatigue. In addition, IDM department students have above-average Zoom exhaustion and fatigue.

Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of The Effects of Oxaliplatin and Naringin on Spleen Tissue in a Rat Model
Özet: Oxaliplatin (OPL) is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Naringin (NRG) is an antioxidant compound with various biological and pharmacological properties. In the present study, the effects of OPL and NRG administrations on spleen tissue of rats were evaluated. On the 1st and 2nd days of the study and on the 5th and 6th days of the study, 30 minutes after oral administration of 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight NRG, 4 mg/kg body weight OPL was injected intraperitoneally. Then, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels and nuclear factorerythroid factor 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B), tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-), B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 mRNA transcript levels were analyzed in spleen tissue. The data obtained showed that NRG reduced the increased MDA levels after OPL treatment. It was also determined that GSH, Nrf2 and HO-1 levels, which decreased with OPL administration, increased after NRG treatment. Moreover, OPLinduced NF-B, TNF-, Bax and Caspase-3 expressions were downregulated by NRG. Taken together, it was concluded that OPL triggered oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in spleen tissue whereas NRG reversed these OPL-induced events.

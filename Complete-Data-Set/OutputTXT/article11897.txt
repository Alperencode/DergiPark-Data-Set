Özet: The focus of this study was to investigate the contribution of the educational activities conducted in museums to the art knowledge and artistic practices of visually impaired students, and to determine the views of students and visual arts teachers about the visits to the museum and the educational processes conducted in museums. The study was conducted with 10 students diagnosed with blindness and visual arts teachers of these students. The mixed method, was used in the study. Research data were collected with achievement tests, document analysis and a structured interview form. The study findings revealed a significant difference between pre-test and post-test achievement test scores of visually impaired students who participated in the educational activities conducted in the museum. A significant difference was determined between the scores of visually impaired students before and after the educational activities in the museum based on adherence of student works to the original work, their composition and interpretation. This research shows that when special access services are provided for visually impaired students who have difficulties in accessing the museum and its educational activities, museums become a learning environment for these students and can make more efficient museum visits.

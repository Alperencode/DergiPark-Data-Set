Makale Başlığı: THE SHARİA COURTS İN THE CLASSİCAL ERA OF THE OTTOMAN LAW
Özet: The Ottoman Empire, which accepted the religion of Islam and embraced Islam, was undoubtedly influenced by the Islamic legal organization. The judicial structure in the Ottoman State was based on the form developed by great states such as the Seljukids and Abbasids, patterning after the judicial organization in the early times of Islam. Although the judicial organization of the state was affected by Islamic law, it did not imitate these states in every respect. On the contrary, internalising the organization in these states, the Ottomans created a distinctive new structure. All disputes in the field of law from the establishment of the state to the Tanzimat era were resolved in the Sharia Courts. As the most important figure at the Ottoman legal organization and the Sharia Courts, qadi (judge) is the one to settle the cases between individuals within the framework of legal provisions. With sufficient education and function, qadi was appointed by the sultan himself. In the Ottoman Empire, qadis were dispatched to the conquered lands as a symbol of Islam and the state. In this context, it may be said that qadis undertook a great legal and social mission in the Ottoman territories.

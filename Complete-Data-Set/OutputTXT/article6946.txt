Makale Başlığı: Effect of Light Intensity and Perch on Fear and Stress Reactions and Some Meat Quality Characteristics in Broilers
Özet: The present study aimed to determine the effect of light intensity and perch use of broiler on fear and stress reactions and some meat quality characteristics in broilers. A total of 270 one-day-old male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to groups based on the three different light intensity (5, 20, and 80 lux) and perch use (perch and no perch) with three replicates. In the study, it has been determined that there was statistically no significant difference between light intensity and perch on tonic immobility duration, L* (lightness), a* (redness), and b* (yellowness) color traits. While the difference between the groups of light intensity was significant (P<0.01), the effect of perch was not significant on heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (P>0.05). pH15 value from meat quality characteristics was detected as 6,04, 5,97, and 5,92 at 5, 20 and 80 lux respectively (P<0.05). While the effect of perch use was not significant, light intensity was significant on cooking loss (P<0.001). At the end of the study, it is indicated that a significant effect of light intensity and perch on water holding capacity from meat quality traits (respectively, P<0.05 and P<0.001). It has been observed that the use of 20 lux light intensity in broilers reduces the heterophile/lymphocyte ratio and cooking loss, and this situation positively affects the welfare of the animals.

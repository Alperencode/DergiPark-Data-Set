Makale Başlığı: Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) Fabrication Using Methanol Extract of Onion Peel as a Natural Sensitizer
Özet: Methanol extracts of onion peel waste (Allium cepa) were applied as natural sensitizer in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) fabrication. This research investigated the dye characteristics of onion peel extract and its power conversion efficiency. Onion peel extraction was carried out using unacidified methanol extract (UME) and acidified methanol extract (AME). Dye absorption was characterized by UV-Vis Spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 200-800 nm and FT-IR at a wave number of 4000-500 cm-1. The power conversion efficiency of the fabricated DSSC was determined by calculating the voltage and current generated by the multimeter. The red onion peel extracts, both acidified and unacidified methanol, had maximum absorption at UV-Visible range (457, 659 and 662 nm). Onion peel extract has several functional groups such as –OH, C=O, C-O-C, C=C, and C-H aromatics- showing specific absorption corresponding to the anthocyanin structure. A solar energy conversion efficiency of η= 0.0413% was obtained from UME extract with a short circuit current of up to Jsc=0.6031 mAcm-2 and a fill factor of 0.2764.

Makale Başlığı: THE MEANING OF TRADITION AND THE ROLE IN THE EXPERIENCE OF UNDERSTANDING
Özet: Tradition has been considered as a remnant of our amateur thoughts from the past, with modern thought dominating time and space and determining artificial points. For the modern perspective, which tries to eliminate individual and social differences and create a universal epistemological fiction, tradition has been seen as a knowledge stock that needs to be covered. Historically conscious thinkers, on the other hand, criticize this view of modern thought on tradition and state that tradition is not something that can be isolated from our world of meaning, and we should refer to it. However, historical consciousness also argues that we can capture the forms of tradition by isolating our own consciousness from today’s ground. Modern consciousness and historical consciousness get close to one another with this approach. In this article, these views of both approaches to tradition will be described and the criticisms of hermeneutic consciousness to these approaches will be discussed. Also, it will be tried to reveal how tradition affects our experience of meaning from a hermeneutic perspective.

Makale Başlığı: The Utilization of the Bicipital Groove Axis for Confirming Alignment of the Humerus with Transepicondylar and Ulnar Shaft Axes During Intramedullary Nailing
Özet: Objectives: Intramedullary nailing is the preferred surgical treatment of humerus shaft fractures. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the bicipital groove with the specific anatomic landmarks to achieve correct alignment of the humerus during intramedullary nailing and to describe anatomical landmarks. Materials and Methods: Thirty (15 right; 15 left) total upper cadaver extremities were used for this study. After the anatomic landmarks were identified and marked, humeral head axis, transepicondylar axis, ulnar shaft axis, bicipital groove axis, and angular measurements of defined axes were obtained.  Results: The mean angle between bicipital groove axis and transepicondylar axis was 48.17° +12.35º (range 20.10º to 74.6º). The mean angle between bicipital groove axis and ulna diaphysis axis was 41.82º +11.56 º (range 17.91º to 68.27º). The mean angle between humeral head axis and bicipital groove axis was 20.53° + 3.90º (range 11.85º to 31.81º). The mean retroversion angle, which was between humeral head axis and transepicondylar axis was 27.52 + 11.37º (range 4.26º to 49.36º). The mean angle between humeral head axis and ulna diaphysis axis was 61.73 + 12.08º (range 33.97º to 86.37º). The mean torsion angle was 62.58º +11.28 º (range 40.74º to 85.74º).  Conclusion: It is thought that to measure and utilize the relationship between bicipital groove, ulna diaphysis and transepicondylar axis can be used for restoring humeral rotation. DOI: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.14.0188This abstract belongs to the un-edited version of the article and is only for informative purposes.

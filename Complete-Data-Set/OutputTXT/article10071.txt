Makale Başlığı: A Period Criticism of Ibrahim Aczî: Dünyaya Bakarak
Özet: Poets reflect their emotional state or the messages they want to convey through the products they put forward. Literary works embodied in line with this purpose are almost the chanting of poets’ feelings. Since they are members of the society they live in and the products produced to bear the properties of the relevant community and environment, it's impossible to interpret and evaluate literary works independently of them. In this respect, the poet can be considered a person who makes various opinions, suggestions, criticisms, and recommendations regarding the community in which he lives. Evaluating the issues related to the structure and functioning of society, the poets focused on the deficient or flawed aspects of individuals or communities. They did not hesitate to criticize these missing and defective individuals and institutions; They warned people and administrators in various fields, especially in authority, custom and morality. İbrahim Aczî Kendi, one of the folk poets, revealed the moral corruption he observed in the society in his work titled “Dünyaya Bakarak”, which he wrote in a plain language with rika in 13 leaves, which is also in the Konya Yusuf Ağa Library; criticized the issues related to the individual and community and stated that the community should return to its original and essence as soon as possible. In this study, Aczî's work titled “Dünyaya Bakarak” will be introduced, and the critical facts of the work will be mentioned. At the end of the study, the transcripted text of the work will be included.

Makale Başlığı: Problems In The Inspection Of Education According To The Education Inspectors
Özet: This study aimed to determine the problems faced by education inspectors during their inspection and to offer recommendations for them. Sample group of the study consisted of 11 education inspectors employed by Ministry of National Education in 2019-20 education and training year. A case study was used in it. Data were collected with a semi-structured form. Data from interview forms were analysed by content and descriptive analysis methods. Data obtained in research analysis were encoded and themes were attained and placed in tables. It was concluded that education inspectors defined inspection as determining whether an organization reached its purposes, what troubles were experienced in practices, and how they could be eliminated with inspectors’ support and as solving the problems. Education inspectors suffered mostly from the problems caused by the inspected ones during inspections, and by inspection system, by themselves and by the inspected institutions. For the solution of problems faced during inspection, they used the methods of making suggestions, open communication, informing, guiding, co-production of solution alternatives, raising awareness of the problem, methods of informing about institutional purposes, holding meetings with administrators and teachers at school after inspection, solving some problems during inspection, developing in individuals a viewpoint and consciousness of the problems, empathy, listening, observation and analysis. Regarding the way of inspection, education inspectors recommended taking guidance and development as basis, sharing inspection data realistically and supporting the parts needing revision, conducting inspection face to face that can cover all the elements of inspected institution, conducting it in a sufficient period and together with inspected institutions, evaluating inspection results, adopting an understanding of thematic inspection, connecting it to certification, producing effective sanctions, inspecting teachers, making course inspections to objective criteria, increasing inspectors’ qualifications, eliminating probable concerns and uncertainties before inspection, and updating inspection system regularly. The results from the study are as follows: Education inspectors defined the inspection as determining with the help of the inspectors whether an organization has attained its purposes, what problems were experienced and how these problems could be solved and as bringing a solution to the problems in this way. During the inspections, education inspectors face problems not only due to the inspected one(s) but also due to the inspection system, the inspectors themselves and the institutions inspected. To solve the problems faced by education inspectors during the inspection, they used the methods of making a suggestion, building an open communication, informing, guiding, co-producing the solution alternatives, raising an awareness of the problem, giving information about the institutional purposes, holding meetings with the directors and teachers at school after the inspection, bringing solutions to some problems in the process of the inspection, developing in people a perspective and conscience of the problems, as well as the methods of empathy, listening, observation and analysis. Education inspectors suggest about the way of inspection that guidance and development should be taken as the basis, data of the inspection should be shared realistically, the parts that need revising or correcting should be supported, inspection should be made face to face in such a way as to cover all the elements of the institution inspected, it should be conducted in a sufficient period, the inspection should be conducted in collaboration with the institutions inspected, inspection results should be evaluated, the understanding of thematic inspection should be adopted, inspection should be ascribed to certification, effective sanctions should be imposed, teachers should be inspected, inspection of the courses should be made according to objective criteria, probable concerns and uncertainties before the inspection should be eliminated and inspection system should be updated regularly.

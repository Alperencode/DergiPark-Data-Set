Makale Başlığı: The Analysis of Middle School Science Course Contents of Out-of-School Learning Environment Guidebooks
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to examine the science contents of "Out of School Learning Environments Guidebooks (OSLEGs)” developed in the 2018-2019 academic year and to compare them. The research was carried out by the document analysis method, one of the qualitative designs. Science content in the OSLEGs, selected randomly from seven provinces (Trabzon, Bursa, Denizli, Osmaniye, Erzurum, Sivas ve Diyarbakır), were analyzed in terms of units / subjects, learning outcome and learning environment. The findings indicated that the most qualified guidebook in terms of relations between unit / subject - learning outcome and learning outcome - learning environment is Denizli’s OSLEG. In addition, it has been determined that the science contents in many OSLEGs do not contain sufficient relations of unit / subject, learning outcome, and learning environment. Based on the results; it is recommended that the OSLEGs should be reorganized at all grades with addressing more unit/subjects, and learning outcomes.

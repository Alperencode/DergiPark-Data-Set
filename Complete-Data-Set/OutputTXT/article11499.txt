Makale Başlığı: Comparison of Perceived Burden of Patients with Heart Failure and their Caregivers
Özet: This study was conducted to compare the perceived burden of heart failure patients and their caregivers. The descriptive and correlational study was conducted in the cardiology department and outpatient clinic of a university hospital. The study sample consisted of 95 patients and 95 caregivers who met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Sociodemographic characteristics form, Burden Interview to measure caregivers' burden and self-perceived burden scale to measure patients' burden were used as data collection tools. The relationship between patient and caregiver burden perception was examined using Pearson correlation analysis. According to the results of the research, the mean score of the patients from the self-perceived burden scale was 28.41 ± 9.72, and the score of the caregivers from the Burden Interview was 32.56 ± 18.43. It was determined that there was a moderately significant positive correlation between the patients' self-perceived burden scale and the caregivers' mean scores of the Burden Interview (r=.489 p=.000). As the burden score perceived by the patients increases, the perceived burden score of the caregiver increases. This shows that as the burden perceived by the patients increases, the perception of caregiver burden increases. It is recommended to plan interventions to reduce the burden of patients and caregivers, and to conduct research showing the effectiveness of these interventions.

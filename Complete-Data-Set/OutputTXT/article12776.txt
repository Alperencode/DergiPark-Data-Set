Makale Başlığı: Some Chemical and Sensory Properties of Ayran Produced by Adding Honeydew Honey and Flower Honey
Özet: The aim of this study is to produce Ayran which improved functional properties by adding honey from different sources to Ayran. The subject of the study is to evaluate the sensory acceptability of Ayran produced with the addition of honey, as well as to examine the effect of different ratios of honey and difference variety of honey on Ayran. Two types of honey (flower and honeydew honey) and an equal mixture of these honeys and two different ratios (10% and 20%) were used in the production of Ayran. Microbiological, chemical and sensory analyzes of Ayran samples were performed during storage (1st, 10th and 21st days). According to the statistical data obtained, the difference between the total dry matter (%), fat (%), lactic acid (%), protein (%) data of Ayran samples was found significant (p<0,05). Ayran samples were evaluated according to their appearance, structure, smell and taste. Ayran with 10% honey added were liked more by the panelists than the others. It was determined that the addition of flower honey was preferred most, followed by honeydew honey and mixed honey. As a result, it has been determined that the addition of honey suppressed the acidic taste of Ayran and contributed to their properties, but when the ratio is exceeded 10%, some properties of Ayran are lost.

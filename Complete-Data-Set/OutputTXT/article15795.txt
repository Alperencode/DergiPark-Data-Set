Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Levels of Metalloproteinases as well as Markers of Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in Lung Tissues After Malathion and Rutin Administrations to Rats
Özet: Malathion (MLT) is an important environmental pollutant in the organophosphate class. Rutin (RUT), on the other hand, is one of the flavonoid family members whose effectiveness against various toxic agents has been extensively studied. In the present study, the effects of MLT and RUT treatments on oxidative stress, apoptosis and metalloproteinases in lung tissues of rats were investigated. In the study, MDA, GSH, Nrf2, HO-1, MMP2, MMP9 and caspase-3 levels in lung tissues were analyzed by biochemical or RT-PCR method after rats received MLT and/or RUT treatment for 28 days. The data showed that MLT-induced MDA levels decreased after RUT treatment. In addition, it was determined that Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA transcript levels and GSH levels suppressed by MLT approached the control group levels after RUT treatment. MLT up-regulated the expression of metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) in lung tissues, while RUT down-regulated the expression of these genes. In addition, it was observed that MLT triggered caspase-3 expression, while RUT exerted an anti-apoptotic effect by suppressing caspase-3. As a result, it was determined that while MLT showed toxic effects in the lung tissues of rats through oxidative stress, apoptosis and metalloproteinases, RUT could alleviate these toxic effects.

Makale Başlığı: Criticism of Gharqad Ḥadīth in Terms of Sanad and Linguistic Analysis of Gharqad
Özet: The Prophet Mohammed warned his ummah by telling the Companions about some unseen news that would occur in the End Times. One of the unseen pieces of news told by the Prophet is about the war between Muslims and Jews mentioned in Muslim’s al-Sahih. It is told that the Jews will hide behind the stones and trees in the war that will break out, the stones and trees will speak and inform the Jew behind them, but the tree called garḳad will not speak and decipher the Jews. Throughout history, ḥadīth commentators have interpreted the speech of the tree and the stone and the non-speech of Sharjah by taking it literally/literally/literally. However, it is clear that reading the events described in the ḥadīth literally/literally in terms of today's technology and the level of science reached will bring along many problems. For this reason, the ḥadīth of garḳad should be reinterpreted by considering its figurative/metaphorical meanings. In the research, firstly, in order to reveal the authenticity of the ḥadīth text, the ḥadīth was criticized in terms of the hadith, and the authenticity of the ḥadīth was revealed. Afterward, similar narrations of the ḥadīth text were determined by making a source-centered interpretation analysis of the garḳad ḥadīth. In the study, the etymological and morphological analysis of garḳad was made and the meanings of this word, and what kind of tree it was examined. Considering the findings after the examination, comparisons and evaluations were made on the literal and metaphorical meanings of garḳad in the hadith. According to the result, it is understood that gharḳad, which the Jews hide behind, symbolizes, allegorically and metaphorically, cinema/visual media and genealogy/population registry.

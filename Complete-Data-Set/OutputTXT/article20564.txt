Makale Başlığı: Restorative Dental Care of Syrian Adolescents and Young Adults with Temporary Protection Identity in Türkiye: A 5-Year Comparative Retrospective Survey
Özet: Objectives: Türkiye has implemented an open-door policy for Syrians since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011 and has been providing dental services via temporary protection identity. This study aimed to assess and compare the restorative dental treatments of Syrian and Turkish adolescents and young adults during 2017-2021 in Bursa City, Türkiye. Methods: Data of present retrospective study were extracted from the Bursa Oral and Dental Health Training and Research Hospital between January 2017 and September 2021 and reviewed by procedure codes, age [early adolescence (10-15 years), late adolescence (16-19 years), and young adults (20-24 years)], sex, nationality (Turkish citizens and Syrians with temporary protection IDs), date of dental appointment, and type restorative treatments. Results: Of all restorative treatments (n=174,657), 4.26% were administered to Syrian patients (n=2993). The intra-group percentages of posterior multi-surface amalgam (33.4%) and anterior composites (25.3%) delivered to the Syrians were significantly higher than those to the Turkish (31.8% and 18.5%, respectively) (p<0.001). Distribution of the restorative treatments by age was similar (p=0.782) in Syrians and Turkish. There was a sharp decrease of 76.5% and 80.0% observed in restorative treatments for Syrians and Turkish, respectively, in 2020. Syrian and Turkish female patients (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.13-1,20), late adolescents, and young adults (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.27-1.38) were more likely to have dental visit>1/year.  Conclusion: Posterior multi-surface amalgam and anterior composite restorations, which were found to be at a higher rate in Syrians, indicate extensive/severe dental caries and poor oral hygiene.

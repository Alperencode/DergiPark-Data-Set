Özet: Countriesappreciate technical and vocational education as important for an economicallyand socially sustainable development. In this context, many studies focus onincreasing the quality of technical and vocational education. The aim of thisstudy is to evaluate the contribution of physics courses to the fundamental electronicsand measurement course in vocational high schools in the context of curriculumand teacher opinions. The data were obtained through semi-structured interviewsconducted with teachers in vocational high schools and by comparing theprograms of the physics and fundamental electronic-measurement courses in thecontext of document analysis. The data obtained from interviews were analyzeddescriptively. Findings of the research showed that the examined courses invocational high schools were not planned as supporting each other. Especiallythe expressions of participant teachers revealed that difficulties arose inteaching the courses which require physics knowledge such as fundamentalelectronics and measurement course in vocational high schools.

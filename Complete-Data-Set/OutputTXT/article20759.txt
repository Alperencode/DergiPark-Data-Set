Makale Başlığı: BUILDING EVERYDAY BORDERING AND SYRIAN  REFUGEES: THE CASE OF ALTINDAĞ
Özet: This study aims at understanding the multifaceted everyday bordering practises that the Syrian refugees face drawing on the 30 in-depth interviews conducted with the Syrian refugees living in Altındağ, Ankara. Building on Critical Border Studies and Migration Studies, the study contends that as the physical borders between Turkey and Syria become more porous, internal bordering practices have become more diffused and are enforced mainly by non-state actors. This has been driving “reactionary bordering” against Syrian refugees by the Turkish population. In order to cope with the bordering practices, Syrian refugees develop various and sometimes contradictory de-bordering strategies. The study revealed 3 types of bordering practices faced by Syrian refugees in Altındağ. These are "bogus refugee" in which the status of asylum seeker is questioned, “cultural bordering” in which Syrians are seen as culturally inferior, and threat perception that sees the refugees as national security concern. The strategies developed by asylum-seekers in response to these practices vary according to their social positionings

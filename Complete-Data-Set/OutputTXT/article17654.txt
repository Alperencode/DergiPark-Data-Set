Özet: There have been legal regulations only for women in our social security system consisting of a premium and non-premium regime. While some of the rights provided to women by these regulations depend on the insurance of the woman, the other part does not depend on the quality of insurance. One fourthof the paid premium days after the enactment of this Law of the ones, among the female insurance holders who request to be put on retirement or old - age pension, who have disabled child to the extent of being in need of constant care of another person, shall be added to the sum of number of premium payment days and these added periods shall be subtracted from the retirement age limits.As a result of providing home care services to a severely disabled child in need of care, there is no requirement to be insured in order to benefit from home care assistance.In our study, first, the regulations regarding women in the Law No. 5510 will be covered in general, then the early retirement opportunity provided to women with severely disabled children who are constantly in need of the care of others will be discussed in detail. And uninsured women – mothers – if they have children that they take care of at home, the home care aid they are entitled to will be explained. Within the framework of the problems related to the scope of these rights provided to women, an evaluation will be made about how men and therefore parents can benefit from these rights, which are provided only towomen who are mothers.

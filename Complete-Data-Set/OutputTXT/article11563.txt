Makale Başlığı: Middle School Mathematics Teachers' Professional Noticing Skills: The Case of Rectangular Prism Volume Problem
Özet: This study aimed to identify the professional noticing skills of middle school mathematics teachers on student thinking about a problem related to the volume of the rectangular prism. The participants were 35 middle school mathematics teachers working in public schools in six different provinces of Turkey and having less than 15 years of professional experience. As a data collection tool, alternative student’s approach to a given problem about the volume of rectangular prism (Tekin-Sitrava, 2014) was taken as basis within the scope of the components of the “Professional Noticing of the Children’s Mathematical Thinking” (Jacobs, Lamb, and Philipp, 2010). Written data from teachers were analyzed through the coding table adapted in the light of current studies based on the theoretical framework of Jacobs et al. (2010). The findings indicated that middle school mathematics teachers generally attended to the student's mathematical strategy regarding the volume of rectangular prism with limited and robust levels. In addition, most of the teachers were at lack and limited levels of interpretation skills. Then, they usually responded to given student’s thinking at ignoring and questioning levels. The findings indicated that teachers need to develop their professional noticing skills, especially interpreting and deciding skills.

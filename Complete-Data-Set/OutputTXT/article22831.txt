Makale Başlığı: War and Postwar Nursıng
Özet: A war is a struggle that states or states have made by using all or part of the national defense resources to solve problems that they cannot solve peacefully. The health of individuals is adversely affected in addition to the human losses caused by reasons such as hunger, misery, epidemic disease and war-related injuries during the war. Nurses, who have many functions such as minimizing negative effects, protecting and improving health, and preventing diseases, have touched the lives of individuals in society both during and after the war throughout history. During and after the war, nurses lead the triage of the sick and the wounded and provide security, and play an active role in improving the health of the society in the post-war processes. After the war, nurses are involved in rehabilitation for injuries that are the primary result of war in the long term, and in the treatment process for mental health problems such as general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and major depression as a secondary result. The purpose of this review; It is the study of nursing services during and after the war that has existed throughout history. With this study, it was concluded that the wars that caused destruction, deaths, injuries and secondary consequences in society not only occurred in the time period but also had an effect for generations, and nurses will continue to have an important function in reducing the negative effects of this process on the health of the individual.

Makale Başlığı: The Evaluation of Plasma Vitamin E and Plasma Nitrite/Nitrate Anion Levels in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients
Özet: Aim: Oxidative stress induces the onset of type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both plasma vitamin E (VE) and nitrite/nitrate anion(NOx) levels might be crucial factors to determine diabetes induced endothelial damage through different mechanisms. Therefore, inthis study, we aimed to evaluate plasma VE and NOx concentrations of newly diagnosed T2DM patients and to understand whether anycorrelation exists with the patients’ lipid profiles.Material and Methods: Blood samples were taken when the patients (n=15) and the controls (n=15) first came to our university’sdiabetes policlinic for investigation and were used to detect plasma VE and NOx levels. Patients’ files were evaluated to record both thedemographic data and biochemical parameters. The data was distributed normally according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Therefore,Student t test was chosen to compare patient and control data and Pearson test was applied for correlation analysis.Results: In newly diagnosed T2DM patients, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride levels were found to be significantly elevated(p=0.036, and p<0.001, respectively), whereas, HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly reduced (p<0.001). Plasma NOx levelsincreased in T2DM patients and this was in positive correlation with TC levels (r=0.392, p=0.032). Plasma VE levels reduced in thediabetic group. A significant negative correlation was found between plasma VE and TC (r=-0.415, p=0.022) as well as triglyceride (r=-0.380, p=0.039) levels.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the protective effect of VE on cell membrane decreases in T2DM. The elevation of plasmaNOx levels is due to increased nitric oxide synthase levels in hyperglycemia. Although no correlation was found between plasma VEand NOx levels, they can be used as specific biomarkers in understanding T2DM induced vascular damage especially in patients withhigh TC levels.

Makale Başlığı: A Grave Context From Kyme IDC Necropolis
Özet: The IDÇ Necropolis, located approximately 1 km away from Kyme, is one of the southern necropolises of the city. The necropolises of Kyme, which should be evaluated as a whole, had to be dealt with separately under the names of industrial companies. One of these areas is the IDÇ Necropolis, whose work was started in 2007 on the land of IDÇ Port Company and named after this operation. The carved cist grave with number 125, which was unearthed during the rescue excavations in 2009, is the subject of our study. These types of graves, which we consider as carved cist graves, appear as a group of graves unique to the Aiolis region. It is seen that researchers use different terms regarding the definition of this type of graves that have been extensively unearthed in the region. These different approaches were tried to be evaluated in the context of grave number 125. In the grave; a total of 23 finds, which we tried to analyze under ceramic, metal, glass and other sub-headings, were found. These finds have a wide range of items such as cosmetic containers, mirrors, gold diadems, necklaces, rings, earrings and glass and bronze objects considered as jewelry accessories. In the light of these finds, grave number 125 was dated to the end of the 4th century BC and the beginning of the 3rd century BC.

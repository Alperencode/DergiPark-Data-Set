Makale Başlığı: The Protective Effect of Rheum Ribes L., and Quercetin on Protein Carbonyl Levels Against Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Liver and Kidney Damage in the Rats
Özet: Objective: This study was designed to examine the potential protective effects of Rheum ribes L., and quercetin on protein carbonyl (PCO) in kidney and liver tissue, trace elements (Fe, Cu, Zn) and mineral (P) in serum samples in Wistar rats of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative damage. Methods: The 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) method is the most reliable method widely used to measure carbonyl levels in proteins. In this study, the effect of Rheum ribes L. (Rr) and quercetin on protein carbonyl, trace elements (Fe, Cu, Zn) and mineral (P) levels against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) mediated liver and kidney damage was investigated. For this purpose, 56 Wistar albino female rats weighing 200 ± 220 g were used. Groups were designed as: controls, 0.3 ml DMSO, 1 ml/kg olive oil, 1 ml/kg CCl4, 100 mg/kg Rr, 100 mg/kg quercetin, 100 mg/kg Rr+1 ml/kg CCl4 and 100 mg/kg quercetin+1 ml/kg CCl4 groups. Results: The results showed that the CCl4 group had significantly higher level of protein carbonyl (PCO) than the control, DMSO, olive oil, Rr and quercetin groups (p<0.001, p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.01, respectively). A significant elevation in the group of CCl4 + quercetin, compare to control, DMSO, olive oil, Rr and quercetin groups (p<0.001, p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05, respectively) in the liver tissue. Additionally, the CCl4 group had significantly higher level of PCO than the control, DMSO, olive oil, Rr and quercetin groups (p<0.001, p<0.01, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). Similarly, the CCl4 + Quercetin group had increased level of PCO compared to the control and Rr.groups (p<0.05 and p<0.05) in the kidney tissue. Conclusion: In the study, it was seen that the bioactive substances in Rheum ribes L. (root) and quercetin, a standard antioxidant, could be an alternative against the toxic effect of CCl4.

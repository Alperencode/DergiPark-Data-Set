Özet: Geometry course is a course that students have difficulties in both learning and perceiving cognitively due to its abstract structure, and teachers have problems in the teaching process. The aim of this study is to examine primary school mathematics teachers' views on teaching geometry. The method of the research is the case study model, one of the qualitative research methods. The data collection tool in the form of semi-structured form was applied to the 16 primary school mathematics teachers in the study group formed by using the appropriate sampling method, and the collected data were analyzed with the content analysis method, one of the qualitative analysis methods. Considering the results, it was determined that the majority of the teachers had difficulties in explaining in the geometry lesson, they developed solutions using technology and concrete materials, and all of the teachers were positive and willing to use technology and concrete materials, but some teachers had a lack of technology in frastructure and material deficiencies in their schools.

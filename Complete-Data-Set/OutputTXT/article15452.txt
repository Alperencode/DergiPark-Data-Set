Makale Başlığı: Questıons Prepared in The Pısa Framework for Context-Based Assessment
Özet: Context-based learning is considered as a learning approach that is recommended to be used so that students can transfer the problems they encounter in daily life and the experiences they have gained to academic environments. It is stated that the evaluation of the academic achievement of the students in the learning and teaching processes carried out by the creation of context-based learning environments should be done with the questions designed for this approach. It is thought that the questions used in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) overlap with the context-based questions. It is predicted that our teachers' measuring the academic achievement of students with context-based questions can raise Turkey higher in PISA. In the studies conducted in this context, it has been concluded that teachers are not sufficient in constructing context-based questions. The resources for sample contexts and questions that teachers can use to write context-based questions are limited. In our study, it is aimed to increase the diversity of sample resources that can be used for context-based assessment by giving place to sample contexts and questions regarding the achievements of the teachers in the 7th grade elective environmental education course, Unit 3.

Makale Başlığı: Claims of Neocebrism in the Context of Human Will and Responsibility
Özet: According to the Islamic belief, the most important and primary reason for the revelation to reach people and hold them accountable is that man is a rational being. Man, unlike animals, has gained privilege as a nature thanks to reason and consciousness. He has been able to choose his actions as a requirement of reason and consciousness and has become a freewill in his actions. All holy books and religions have agreed on the will and responsibility of human beings. Because the understanding of irresponsible and willless human leads to severing the ties with God and leaving the individual from the status of responsible servant. As in the past, there have been groups and ecoles that ignore the aspect of human being free in his will and actions. As a matter of fact, for the early periods, the rejection that the people in the Cebriye ecole have willpower and freedom in their choices did not remain in history, but also manifested itself with different reasons and other versions in modern times. Today, however, determinism, and especially the understanding of genetic determinism (genetic paradigm), appears in the form of a new Neocebrism and rejects human will, claiming that it is based on science. Thus, it sees man as an automaton and does not accept divine revelation and man's dealing with him. In our study, this modern understanding, which contradicts the basic principles of religion, will be examined in terms of Islamic theology, and its scientific reality value and sociological results will be determined.

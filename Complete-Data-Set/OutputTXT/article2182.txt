Makale Başlığı: The evaluation of oxidative stress parameters and nitric oxide in healthy and preeclamptic pregnant women
Özet: In the present study, oxidative damage parameters in preeclamptic pregnant women were investigated and compared with healthy tissues. Antioxidant enzymes were determined in 53 preeclamptic and 53 healthy pregnant placentas. The damage of free oxygen radicals in the placental tissue was determined by measuring by antioxidant enzyme systems (The amounts of lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT), myeloperoxidase (MPx) enzyme activities and nitric oxide levels (NO)). The LPO levels increased in the pregnant woman who has had preeclampsia compared with healthy pregnant. While the amount of GSH was high in healthy placental tissues, it was found to be quite low preeclampsia tissues. While CAT, MPx enzyme activities and levels of NO were quite high in the placental tissues of women with preeclampsia, they were found to be low in healthy tissues. The antioxidant enzyme activities and amounts show significant differences between groups in placental tissues.  In line with these data, we can say that oxidative stress parameters show the damage at the tissue level quite well.  As a result, the data obtained show oxidative damage in the placental tissue and indicate that the antioxidant mechanism works.

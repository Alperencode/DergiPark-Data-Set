Makale Başlığı: Yûsuf Sûresi Bağlamında Üç Kriz
Özet: Crisis refers to the negative situations that can be encountered in every period. Ordinary people may encounter such a crisis environment as well as prophets. One of the prophets who faced this crisis environment is Yusuf. In Surah Yusuf, important sections about Yusuf's life are included. An important part of this is related to the difficulties and troubles that Yusuf experienced. It is possible to list the crises that Yusuf experienced as familial, moral and economic crises. He was exposed to sibling jealousy because of his father's love for him at a young age. Again, because of Züleyha's unpleasant request, he was slandered. Another crisis that he has faced is the economic crisis experienced in a certain period in the country. Yusuf successfully emerged from all these troubles, troubles, calamities and crises. The main factor underlying his success is that he acts according to revelation. In addition, it is the right crisis management that is applied at the time of crisis. In addition, Yusuf's being equipped with moral values such as mercy, forgiveness, patience and knowledge has an important place in the successful resolution of the crisis. The troubles and difficulties that Yusuf experienced, and his method of getting rid of them, are an example that the Qur'an has brought for today's people to take a lesson. In our study, we will primarily focus on the concept of crisis. Afterwards, The troubles and difficulties that Yusuf experienced will be discussed and analyzed in the context of Surah Yusuf under the headings of family, moral and economic crisis.

Makale Başlığı: An overview of the studies on Turkish surnames
Özet: A name is usually added before or after the person's name to indicate himself/herself, his/her family, tribe or community to which he belongs. Surnames, which come after the personal name that makes the person known by the family and are defined as the family name, act as cultural transmitters as well as reflecting the tradition and culture. The use of surnames is required by law in some societies. In some societies, although it is not a necessity, surnames are used to prevent name confusion among people. Throughout history, Turks have used family, clan and tribe names to introduce themselves as well as their own names. For this reason, it is possible to come across names of Turkish origin that serve as surnames in the lands where Turks exist. In the Ottoman Empire,  in order to describe people, instead of surnames, titles such as "bey, ağa, efendi" or names indicating the occupations of the people were used instead of surnames. After the proclamation of the Republic, with the Surname Law adopted in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 1934, it became compulsory for everyone to take a surname and use this surname in official affairs. The use of nicknames and titles such as ağa (agha), hacı (pilgrim), hafız (hafiz),  hoca (hodja), molla (mullah), efendi (master), bey, beyefendi (gentleman), paşa (pasha), hanımefendi (lady) and  hazretleri (his nibs) have been abolished. In this study, studies on Turkish surnames were classified according to their subjects. In addition, information is given about the studies on Turkish surnames both in Turkey and in foreign countries outside of Turkey, and a bibliography on Turkish surnames is also included.

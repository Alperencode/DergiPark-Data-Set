Makale Başlığı: The Shadow Economy and Financial Development in the Turkish Economy
Özet: The shadow economy is a term associated with several macro variables. While  the  course  of  these  variables  may  in  some  cases  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  shadow  economy,  in  others  it  may  have  a  reducing  effect.  Financial  development,  however,  is  a  concept  closely  related  to  the  shadow  economy  and  according  to  the  relevant  literature  is  said  to  have a reducing effect on the shadow economy. This study examines the relationship  between  the  shadow  economy  and  financial  development  for the case of Turkey. While this study represents financial development with  the  indices  of  financial  development,  financial  institutions,  and  financial markets, it indicates the shadow economy by using data estimated by Elgin, Kose, Ohnsorge, & Yu (2021)’s dynamic  general  equilibrium  (DGE)  model.  Covering  the  period  1990-2017,  the  study  employs  the  augmented  Dickey-Fuller  (ADF)  unit  root  and  Fourier  Todo-Yamamoto  causality  tests  for  the  empirical  analysis.  The  results  obtained  from  the  study  state  only  one  causality  to  be  present  between  the  financial  markets  and  the  shadow  economy.  In  line  with  this  conclusion,  the  importance  of  financial  development  should  be  remembered  and  not  ignored  in  the  struggle  with  the  shadow  economy,  with  financial  development  being  able  to  be  said  to  have  a  shrinking effect on the shadow economy.

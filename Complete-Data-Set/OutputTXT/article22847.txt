Makale Başlığı: Does Someone Else’s Industry Contribute to Democratization?
Özet: In this letter I argue that to have a democratic regime in a developing country should be preceded by a national industry. Industrialization that belongs to a nation creates a public-political field to pursue economic as well as political rights. An exported industry from an industrialized country disregards the opportunity for the working people to perceive and pursue their political rights. Democratization for many students of political sciences as well as citizens of the world is perceived as an immediate increase in living standards which may contribute to disappointment and authoritarian leadership.

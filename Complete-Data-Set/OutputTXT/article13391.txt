Makale Başlığı: Onıcomycosıs and Treatment Approaches
Özet: Onychomycosis is one of the main nail infections, accounting for approximately 50% of nail diseases. Many factors create difficulties in the treatment of onychomycosis, such as treatment non-compliance, high cost, long treatment period, and the high probability of recurrence of the disease. It is also important to make an accurate diagnosis for the treatment of onychomycosis accurately and cost-effectively. Although different diagnostic methods are used, the most preferred method is fungal culture. In the treatment of onychomycosis, oral and topical treatment methods can be applied separately or in combination. Allylamines and azoles are used in the oral treatment and the efficiency is high. However, hepatotoxic effects and drug-drug interactions can create major problems for oral therapy. In topical treatment, ciclopirox, amorolfine, efinaconazole, and tavborole are most commonly used. Different antifungals solutions or herbal extracts are also used as topical treatment method. Topical medications are easier to apply and have far fewer side effects, but the keratin-rich structure of the nails causes poor penetration. In this review, the diagnostic methods and new approaches in the treatment of onychomycosis are reviewed.

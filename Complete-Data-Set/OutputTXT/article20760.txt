Makale Başlığı: FEMALE MIGRATION AND FERTILITY IN TURKEY:  REASSESSMENT USING 2018-TDHS
Özet: This study examines the associations between female internal migration and fertility using different indicators such as cumulative cohort fertility visualizations and multivariate Poisson models. Using data from the most recent Turkey Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), 2018 TDHS, we analyze how migrant women’s fertility behaviors vary compared to those of non-migrant (urban or rural native) women based on five different hypotheses. We use two different migrant definitions by: (i) comparing current and childhood places of residence, and (ii) comparing current and previous places of residence. In addition to urban native and rural native women, four migrant categories are defined: rural-urban, rural-rural, urban-rural, and urban-urban migrants. Our multivariate analysis results imply that compared to rural natives, urban-rural and rural-urban migrant women are more likely to have births. Our findings support for negative selectivity among rural-urban and urban-rural migrants. For migration from rural to urban areas, we provide support for both disruption (first two years) and adaptation hypotheses in the long run. For urban-rural migrants, we see no disruption effects but selection effects. Overall, by providing more detailed analyses and up-to-date methodologies, our findings provide support for all five hypotheses for different groups of migrant women in Turkey.

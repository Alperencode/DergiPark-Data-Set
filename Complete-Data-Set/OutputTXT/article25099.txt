Makale Başlığı: Competitive Team-Based Learning versus Group Investigation with Reference to the Language Proficiency of Iranian EFL Intermediate Students
Özet: This paper is a report on an experimental study which intended to look into the  possible effects of Competitive Team-Based Learning (CTBL) vis-à-vis Group  Investigation (GI) method of Cooperative Learning (CL) on the language  proficiency of Iranian EFL intermediate students. Seventy homogeneous Iranian  intermediate students were selected out of a total population of 110 to serve the  present study. The results of the study indicated the advantage of CTBL over GI in  terms of its effect on improving the target group’s language proficiency. The  results of the study were in contrast to the reports of researchers like Ab-Raza  (2007), an Israeli language specialist, who have argued that students in Islamic  countries “do not value diversity of ideas, beliefs, and perspectives” (p. 5) and so  cannot be taught through modern methods like those of CL

Makale Başlığı: "Verses to the mother and her postmortem signs" in the Line  Extending from Womanhood to Motherhood, from Motherhood to the Masculine System
Özet: Lale Müldür made her poetry the cradle of civilizations with her associative field stretching from east to west. Poems are based on Indian, Greek, Egyptian and Turkish mythology. The imagination field of poetry opens up to multidimensional universes through intercultural transitions. Accordingly, Lale Müldür's "verses to the mother and her postmortem signs" is like a parade in the world of images. Gods, goddesses and historical heroes are handled by men and women in the modern world. In a cosmic plan, men and women are reconsidered. Gender roles are rescheduled and distributed. The beings that emerged after the death of the "mother", the parts that were detached from the mother's soul, carry the codes of a reshaped world. The poet refers to three women with the word "mother". In this article, the “verses for the mother and her postmortem signs” have been discussed in line with the above impressions.

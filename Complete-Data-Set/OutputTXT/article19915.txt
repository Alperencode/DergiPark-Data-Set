Makale Başlığı: Effect of vitamin D supplementation on growth parameters in children with vitamin D deficiency
Özet: Objectives: To study the effect Vitamin D supplementation on weight and height standard deviation score in Vitamin D deficient children. Material and methods: The study was conducted by selecting Vitamin D deficient children based on serum. Vitamin D level and their Weight and Height was measured. One dose of 3,00,000 IU intramuscular along with calcium (50 mg/kg/day) was given to all the children. After 3 months, serum Vitamin D level, weight and height standard deviation Score was measured and the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. A balanced block randomization method was used to randomize the participants, into Group 1 and 2. The first group received calcium (50 mg/kg/day) and the second Group received 400 IU/day of Vitamin D3 along with calcium (50 mg/kg/day) for 9 months. After 9 months, serum Vitamin D level, weight and height standard deviation score was measured. Results: Age of the study subjects in group 1 was 3.5 ± 0.8 years whereas that in group 2 was 3.3 ± 0.7 years. Mean Wtsds in group 1 was 0.42 ± 0.01 whereas that in group 2 was 0.39 ± 0.02. There was a significant positive correlation between serum vitamin D level and Wtsds and Htsds. The increment in Wtsds was much lower in group 1(0.42 ± 0.07) as compared to group 2 (1.15 ± 0.01) and this difference was statistically significant. The increment in mean Htsds was 0.07 ± 0.01 in group 1 which was significantly lower than that in group 2 (0.35 ± 0.02). Conclusion: The present study showed that the weight standard deviation score and height standard deviation score progressively improved with the vitamin D supplementation.

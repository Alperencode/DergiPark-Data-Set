Makale Başlığı: Environmental effects of sulfur-based autotrophic and methanol based heterotrophic denitrification processes
Özet: The utilization of inorganic electron donors in denitrification is gaining popularity because of its advantages over organic electron donors, such as low cost and less effluent organic contamination risk. Elemental sulfur is widely used in autotrophic denitrification, but acidity and sulfate production are the main drawbacks of sulfur-based denitrification. Limestone or dissolved alkalinity sources are used to provide alkalinity. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of three denitrification processes (limestone-assisted SO-based, bicarbonate-based SO-based, and methanol-based denitrification) were performed to determine their environmental impacts (abiotic depletion, global warming potential, ozone depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, seawater ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation (POCP), acidification and eutrophication) by using the CML 1A baseline of SimaPro 9.1.1 software for LCA, and AWARE V1.03 for water footprint. In all groups, 25 mg of NO3 - -N/L was successfully removed; however, using NaHCO3 in S0 -based denitrification, the environmental impact was higher than in other processes. The lowest environmental impact occurred limestone-assisted SO-based process. The highest environmental impact is due to the use of electricity, and 65 kg of the global warming potential of 75.38 kg CO2 equivalent in the bicarbonatefed group is due to the use of electricity. Water footprint for 1 kg NO3 - - N/m3 functional unit was found to be 24.3 m3 , 30.7 m3 and, 45.1 m3 for heterotrophic denitrification, limestone and, bicarbonate-based autotrophic, respectively. Autotrophic denitrification has advantages over heterotrophic denitrification in terms of cost and water quality, but the use of NaHCO3 as a source of alkalinity should be avoided.

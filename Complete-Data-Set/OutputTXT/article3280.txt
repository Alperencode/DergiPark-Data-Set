Makale Başlığı: Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük Hellenistik Period Local Production and Traditional Painted Decorated Ceramics
Özet: During the long-lasting excavations at Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük paint decorated vessels were found in the Hellenistic layer. The surfaces of these vessels are decorated with various motifs. In this study, Hellenistic vessels with band/spiral, dot and bird decoration motifs, which are also seen on the Iron Age vessels from Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük and were still use in the Hellenistic Period, are discussed. A ceramic furnace was found in the plan square H07 in the Chantier II area in Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük in 2011. This furnace was dated to the Hellenistic Period using finds and the C14 method. Since the ceramic furnace was built on the Late Iron Age layer, it started to be used in the early phase of the Hellenistic Period. It is understood from the finds that the use of the furnace continued until the IInd century BC. It is thought that the paint decorated vessels were produced in this furnace. The locally produced vessels of Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük were introduced with this study and their relation with Central Anatolian ceramics was examined.

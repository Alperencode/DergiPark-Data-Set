Makale Başlığı: Frequency of wood decay fungi in urban trees in Çankırı
Özet: The study was conducted to identify and determine the frequency of wood decay fungi in urban trees in Çankırı city centre. During surveillance surveys, fifty-nine fungal fruit bodies were collected from fifty-three trees. Based on ITS and LSU DNA sequence analysis, Inonotus hispidus, Cerioporus squamosus, Pleurotus sp., Cyclocybe aegerita sensu lato, Schizophyllum commune and Coprinellus micaceus were identified in urban trees. The frequencies of these fungi on urban trees planted along ten main streets in the city centre were determined through systematic surveys. Fungi were detected on 10 % of the trees. I. hispidus and C. squamosus were the most common wood decay fungi (45 and 15 % respectively). Both species are recognized among common and dangerous pathogenic wood decay fungi of urban trees worldwide. The frequencies of fruit bodies were highest on Fraxinus spp. (38%), followed by Acer negundo (32%) and Platanus orientalis (15%). I. hispidus was the only fungus detected on Fraxinus spp.. On A. negundo, Cy. aegerita s.l. and C. squamosus being the most common, other fungi were also observed. I. hispidus and C. squamosus were also detected on P. orientalis, yet relatively rarely. In Turkey, numerous wood decay fungi, including those detected in this work, were identified on living trees. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the frequencies of wood decay fungi were not investigated before this work in Turkey. In future studies, we suggest investigating the severity of wood decays especially those caused by I. hispidus and C. squamosus in urban trees in Çankırı.

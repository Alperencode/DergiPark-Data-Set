Makale Başlığı: Effects of arthroscopic meniscal repair performed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on post operative rehabilitation after surgery
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional effects of meniscal repair performed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on knee joint during post-operative stage.Methods: Postoperative rehabilitation results of 15 patients (age: 27±8 years) who had both anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with meniscus repair (ACL+M), and 15 patients (age: 34±8 years) who had isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) were compared in terms of functional outcomes.In both groups, the rehabilitation program was started on the first postoperative day and continued for 6 weeks. Differently, the ACL+M group did not load the operated leg for 15 days and knee flexion was limited to 90 degrees. Except for these two 15-day restrictions, the two groups were included in the same rehabilitation program. M. Quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscle strength of the subjects were measured with a handheld dynamometer, and knee range of motion was measured with an inclinometer. Lysholm Knee Scale was used to assess functional disability.Results: As a result of the evaluations, M. Quadriceps femoris muscle strength was found to be higher in the ACL-R group than in the ACL+M group at the 1st (p=0.011), 4th (p=0.048) and 6th (p=0.001) weeks. However, there was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of muscle strength averages at 2 weeks (p=0.229). Although there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of knee joint flexion angle and Lysholm Knee Scale results at all weeks (p>0.05), extension limitation was found to be higher in the ACL+M group at the 1st (p=0.006) and 2nd (p=0.012) weeks.Conclusion: Restrictive rehabilitation applied to the ACL-M group in the postoperative period may have negative effects on the M. Quadriceps femoris muscle strength and the degree of full extension in the early period.

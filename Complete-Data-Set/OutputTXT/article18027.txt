Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Interleukin-38 in patients with primary Sjögren’s Syndrome
Özet: Aim: Interleukin-38 has been involved as an inflammatory mediator in rheumatic diseases. However, little is known about the role of IL-38 in the development of primary Sjögren’s syndrome. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of IL-38 in primary Sjögren’s syndrome and its clinical relevance.Material and Method:Between 2019 and 2020, 40 patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome and 39 healthy participants were included in the study. The serum IL-38 level was measured by ELISA in all participants. The serum levels of IL-38 were compared with clinical and laboratory features. Results:The serum IL-38 levels between the patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome and the controls were similar (58.0 pg/ml, min-max: 0-641.0 vs. 55.0 ng/ml, min-max: 0-338.0; p=0.511). No significant correlations were found between serum IL-38 level and SSDAI (r=-0.104, p=0.523). IL-38 level was mildly negatively correlated with RF (r=-0.364, p=0.021) and positively correlated with CRP (r=0.321, p= 0.044).Conclusion:The correlation of IL-38 with CRP and RF should be considered because it might be important clues for contribution to the disease process. IL-38 might be relevant to the heterogeneous nature of PSS and the future role of IL-38 might be a biomarker for specific clinical manifestations of pSS.

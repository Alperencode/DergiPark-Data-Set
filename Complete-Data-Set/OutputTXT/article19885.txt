Makale Başlığı: The effects of pediatric dentifrices with different types of fluoride on the color change of restorative materials
Özet: Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dentifrices with different fluoride content on color change of restorative materials commonly used in pediatric dentistry. Materials and methods: Three restorative materials (glass hybrid [Equia Forte (EF)], glass carbomer [GCP Glass Fill (GCP)] and compomer [Dyract XP (DXP)]) were used to prepare 120 disc shaped specimens by using a Teflon ring. Four dentifrice groups were created as Sodium Fluoride (NaF), Amine Fluoride (AmF), Stannous Fluoride (SnF2) and no-fluoride (n = 40). Simulated tooth brushing was performed for each specimen by applying 6720 strokes for 6 months. Color changes [CIEDE2000 (Δ𝐸𝐸00)] were calculated by using generalized linear model procedure and the data were subjected to two-way analysis of variance. Results: The highest color changes for NaF and AmF dentifrice groups were observed in the GCP restorative material (p <0.05). The color changes of restorative materials tested with SnF2 dentifrice group were statistically different (p < 0.05) in each restorative material and Δ𝐸𝐸00 values were observed as GCP> EF>DXP. SnF2 dentifrice provided better color stability for all restorative materials when compared to NaF and AmF dentifrices; although, this was not statistically significant. GCP underwent significant discoloration values when brushed with all types of dentifrices. Conclusion: Although the glass carbomers caused significant color change, the compomers seem to be more resistant to the color change when brushed with all types of dentifrices. The fluoride content of dentifrices is crucial for the color change of restorative materials.

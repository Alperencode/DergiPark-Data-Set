Makale Başlığı: THINKING ON THE CHANGING REPRESENTATION OF MUSIC ON CYBERSPACE
Özet: This paper addresses the emerging concept of cyberization of music througha particular focus on the changing representation of music. In this context, thefirst part presents a historical overview on the representation of music for abetter understanding of today’s digitalization of music. The second part revolvesaround the intertwining relationship between technology and society and itsimpact on cultural preferences and taste in music. The last part focusesparticularly on the emerging concept of cyberization of music and questions theways it transformed the musical representation. The evaluations expose anever-changing musical representation in our contemporary era, with a lack oflive interaction where music followers tend to be influenced by the shared viewof the others. Since there is no single and absolute correct way of analyzingthe cyberspace for it has become an overarching term used to describe amultitude of aspects of the new communication technologies, the evaluations hereinwishes to contribute to the interpretation of music on cyberspace.

Makale Başlığı: Access to Education of Syrian Refugees Living in Türkiye
Özet: After the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, millions of people had to flee for their lives. The continued waves of migration have created many problems. One of these problems is the education of refugee children – one of the most affected groups by the war. Most of these refugees made their way to Turkey, which is one of the countries that was most affected by this humanitarian crisis. While some of the Syrian refugee children live in the camps, some of them live in different cities outside the camps. The present study compares the situation of Syrian refugee children who live outside the camps and those who live inside. I also examine the views of different authors who have addressed this issue. Children's access to education is inevitable in terms of both international law and domestic law. However, these refugee children who live outside the camps have some basic responsibilities such as providing for their families since life outside is more challenging. Life inside the camp is relatively easier as the Turkish state provides assistance and training opportunities. This research demonstrates that the integration into the education system for children who live outside the camps is more difficult. On the other hand, access to social and educational opportunities is easier and faster for those who live in state-sponsored camps.

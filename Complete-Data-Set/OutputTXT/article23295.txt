Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Metaverse in Terms of the Tourism Sector in the Context of the Gray Rhino Metaphor
Özet: The purpose of the article is to understand and discuss the place of metaverse in the tourism sector within the scope of the gray rhino metaphor used for neglected but obvious risks and situations. In this context, a comprehensive literature review was carried out on the subject by using secondary data. First of all, the gray rhino metaphor, metaverse and metaverse concepts in tourism are explained. In the literature review, no study has been found in which tourism and the metaverse have been examined within the scope of the gray rhino metaphor. In this study, by examining the metaverse in tourism in the context of the gray rhino metaphor, it is expected to contribute to the evaluation of the subject from a different perspective, to be prepared for digital transformation in tourism and to gain competitive advantage. As a result of the research, it was concluded that the concept of metaverse is compatible with the metaphor of the gray rhino, and that the metaverse in tourism can be described as an unidentified gray rhino.

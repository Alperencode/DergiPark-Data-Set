Makale Başlığı: Assessment of Fruit and Some Biochemical Characteristics of Almond Genotypes Selected From Natural Populations of Kayseri Province
Özet: Almond (Prunus amygdalus L.) can grow under dry climate and harsh soil conditions. The fruitsare drupe. Seed-propagated almond populations exist in various parts of Turkey.Several studies have been performed to select the promising genotypes amongthese populations with regard to fruit quality, yield, late foliations and etc.characteristics. Rich almond populations are shown around the foothills ofErciyes Mountain in Kayseri province of Central Anatolia. In this study, somefruit and biochemical characteristics of 34 almond genotypes selected aspromising genotypes with regard to late foliation and yield were determined.Significant variations (P < 0.05)were observed in investigated traits of the genotypes. Of selected genotypes,fruit weights varied between 1.5±0.4- 7.6±0.5 g, fruit lengths between40.7±0.7 - 19.9±2.9 mm, fruit heights between 17.4±0.8 – 10.3±2.1 mm and fruitwidths between 27.6±0.7 – 11.8±0.7 mm. With regard to fruit shape of genotypes,13 were identified as long oval, 12 as elliptical, 5 hearth-shaped and 4 asround. Considering the biochemical characteristics, crude oil contents variedbetween 54.9 - 42.1% and protein contents varied between 24.6 – 17.7%.

Makale Başlığı: The Types of Monochrome Glazed Ceramics in the Beçin Castle Excavation (2014-2021)
Özet: Beçin is a residential center in the Milas District of the Turkish Province of Muglain the Aegean Region. Becin has a history dating back to 2000 B.C. and is animportant Anatolian city that has hosted many cultures such as the Carians inancient times and the Mentese Principality in the Ottoman period. The mainsubject of this study involves the Turkish red monochrome-glazed clay ceramicsand their types found in Beçin Castle excavations between 2014 and 2021. Thetechnique of monochrome glazing is one of the most common decorating techniques applied in Byzantine, Principalities, and early Ottoman art. It was frequently encountered on the ceramicsunearthed in the Beçin Excavation because of its ease of application and functionality. Ceramics such as bowls,plates, jugs, and oil lamps made using this technique were recovered mostly in pieces and sometimes whole in theexcavations. Although green glaze is mostly seen in monochrome glaze ceramics, yellow and blue glazing were alsofrequently preferred. The inner surfaces of these ceramics are completely glazed, while the outside is only partiallyglazed. Monochrome glazed ceramics are grouped under their various forms. In the academic sources, especiallybowls are classified as spherical, hemispherical, conical body or semi-conical body. The first aim of the study is to tryto create a common typology by comparing the form features of the Medieval ceramics in the ceramic productioncenters in the east and west of Anatolia with the Beçin Castle ceramics. In addition, revealing the importance of Beçinceramics in medieval Anatolia is among other purposes.

Makale Başlığı: U.S.-Turkey Relationship and Syrian Crisis
Özet: The Syrian crisis is an amalgamation of strategicstruggle for power and influence in the Middle East and the internal andexternal factors which are based on ethnic lines. Some are supporting the Assadregime, while as some are against it. The Syrian crisis has now transformedfrom a domestic or regional issue to a global security issue. The removal ofAssad is a central step for both the Syrian people as well as the anti-Assadcomp. However, after three years of fighting, the situation seems to be complexand without any possible outcome. In addition, the presence of extremists(ISIS) and a strong Iranian and Russian support for the regime, the Syriancrisis is jeopardizing the interests of both U.S. and Turkey. Both U.S. andTurkey have numerous national security interests at stake in Syria. However,the interests of both the countries do not perfectly match with each other.Turkey is unhappy about U.S’s unwillingness to help the opposition to topplethe Assad regime. Different priorities in the conflict have strained thebilateral relations. The aim of this paper is to analyse the U.S-Turkeyrelations in the light of recent Syrian crisis. An attempt will be made tohighlight the issues which strain the bilateral relationship. This paper willhighlight the divergent and convergent points in U.S-Turkey relations. Thispaper will also focus on U.S and Turkish policies vis-à-vis Syria. The policiesof both the countries will be critically evaluated
